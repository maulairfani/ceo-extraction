In/uni00A0order to build and maintain trust in Rio Tinto, we must seek to achieve environmental and social goals alongside generating pro/fit for our shareholders. Our purpose as a company is to produce materials essential to human progress and we are committed to ful/filling this role in a sustainable and inclusive way.\n\nIn 2020, our safety performance and our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic were a demonstration of this company at its best. However, the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, in Western Australia, was a breach of both our values and the trust placed in us by the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people and other Traditional Owners of the land on which we operate. In the months and years to come, we are determined to learn the lessons from Juukan Gorge, to rebuild the trust that has been lost, and to re-establish our leadership in environmental and social performance.\n\n## Our response to the pandemic\n\n2020 was a dif/ficult and challenging year for everyone, but I am proud of Rio Tinto's response to the global pandemic. As COVID-19 threatened lives and livelihoods around the world, the entire company mobilised to safeguard our employees, contractors and local communities, and to keep our operations running safely and smoothly.\n\nAt our Pilbara iron ore operations, for example, within a matter of days, thousands of employees adapted to new rosters and changed /fly-in, /fly-out travel schedules. We secured additional charter /flights and redesigned procedures at our camps to maintain social distancing and we instituted rapid health screening at airports across Western Australia. Around the world, we also took measures to reduce the risk of transmission from our employees to the remote and vulnerable communities near our operations. The success of Rio Tinto in 2020 was due, in no small part, to this remarkable effort by our entire workforce.\n\n## Safety\n\nDespite all these changes, and the uncertainty created by the pandemic, we achieved a second consecutive year with zero fatalities. This remarkable achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of thousands of employees and contractors, every day, on every shift. But we need to do even better in our overall safety performance and will not be satis/fied until we have eliminated all work-related injuries.",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\n## Chairman's Statement continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial performance and economic contribution\n\nAs a result of the efforts of our 45,000 1 employees in 35 countries to keep our operations running safely, the Group performed strongly in 2020. The strength and resilience of our business enabled us to protect thousands of jobs across our supply chain, and continue to pay taxes and royalties to governments and dividends to pension funds, when many other companies were forced to cut back.\n\nWe recorded underlying earnings of $12.4 billion (2019:/uni00A0$10.4 billion) and free cash /flow of $9.4 billion (2019: $9.2 billion) in 2020. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with net debt at year-end of $0.7 billion. These robust results re/flect strong demand in our major markets, especially China, with iron ore prices, in particular, supported by supply disruptions across the/uni00A0industry.\n\nAs many of our host governments spent record sums to support their people and economies during the pandemic, our direct economic contribution, including payments to employees, suppliers, governments and shareholders, amounted to $47 billion. In 2020, the Rio Tinto Group paid more than $8 billion in taxes and royalties globally, including Australia where we are one of the largest taxpayers, contributing more than $6.5 billion in taxes and/uni00A0royalties.\n\nIn recognition of this strong /financial performance, the Board is recommending a /final dividend of 309 US cents per share (2019: 231 US cents per share) and a special dividend of 93 US cents per share, taking total dividends declared this year to $9/uni00A0billion.\n\n## The destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock/uni00A0shelters\n\nThese achievements were overshadowed by the destruction of two ancient rock shelters in the Juukan Gorge, at the Brockman 4 iron ore mine in Western Australia, in May 2020, which should not have happened.\n\nI/uni00A0would like to reiterate our unreserved apology to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people for the destruction of the rock shelters.\n\nThe loss of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters has also impacted many others, in Australia and beyond, and within our company it has left many of our employees, including our Indigenous Australian colleagues, feeling deeply shocked and ashamed.\n\nFollowing publication of the Board Review of the events leading up to the destruction of the rock shelters, and consultations with shareholders in Australia, Europe and North America, our Chief Executive, the Chief Executive of Iron Ore and the Group Executive, Corporate Relations, have left the company by mutual agreement.\n\nThe Board and senior leadership team have taken decisive action to implement the recommendations set out in the Board Review and the Interim Report of the Parliamentary Inquiry. These include measures to ensure that the destruction of a site of such exceptional cultural signi/ficance never happens again; to re-con/firm that we have recently consulted with Traditional Owners for potential impacts; and to begin the modernisation process of our agreements with the Traditional Owners in Western Australia to increase transparency and redress the imbalance of power that existed in our older agreements.\n\nWe are also reinvigorating our cultural awareness training, have stepped up our investment in career development for Indigenous Australians and taken numerous other measures to ensure that Indigenous Australians have a stronger voice, not only in our host communities, but also within Rio Tinto. In parallel with these internal changes, we have continued to engage with the Government of Western Australia in relation to reforming the Aboriginal Heritage Act of 1972.",

        "page_content": "In November 2020, my fellow director Megan Clark (Chair/uni00A0of our Sustainability Committee) and I visited the Juukan Gorge with the PKKP people. It was my /first opportunity to apologise in person to the PKKP people for the destruction of the rock shelters, and to see and feel their sadness and pain /first-hand. Megan and I subsequently attended a joint meeting of the PKKP and Rio Tinto Boards in Perth, where we discussed the steps that we must take to rebuild trust and to strengthen our partnership, as well as progress with the remedy process.\n\nSeparately, Megan and I also met elders from nine of the ten Traditional Owners of the lands where we operate in Western Australia. The Traditional Owners expressed their sadness and anger at the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, but they also expressed their hopes for a more equal and respectful relationship with Rio Tinto in the/uni00A0future.\n\nTraditional Owners recognise the social and economic bene/fits that mining brings to their communities, but they demand a relationship with our company that respects local customs and traditions and recognises their obligation to preserve their unique culture for future generations. It is our responsibility to make sure this happens both now and into the future, and I know that this determination is shared throughout our organisation.\n\n## The appointment of Jakob Stausholm as Chief Executive\n\nI am delighted to welcome Jakob Stausholm as our new Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2021. Since joining Rio Tinto as an executive director and Chief Financial Of/ficer in 2018, Jakob has played a key role in strategy development and performance management, allocating capital with discipline and helping to deliver record shareholder returns. Jakob's blend of strategic and commercial expertise, and his collaborative leadership style, strong values and commitment to sustainable development, make him the ideal choice for our next Chief Executive.\n\nA further advantage is that, as an internal candidate, he will be able to apply his existing knowledge and understanding of the Group to some of the key investment and growth decisions arising in the shorter term.\n\n## Other Board changes\n\nDuring 2020, we also welcomed three new non-executive directors - Hinda Gharbi, Jennifer Nason and Ngaire Woods - and the Board has already bene/fited from their insights and expertise in natural resources, /finance, technology, governance, public policy, diversity and inclusion. At the end of the year, we bid farewell to David Constable, who steps down to assume the role of Chief Executive Of/ficer at Fluor Corporation. A search for his replacement is underway as we seek to strengthen representation on the Board from our key countries of operation.\n\n## Engagement with stakeholders\n\nDespite the limitations imposed by the pandemic, the Board engaged extensively with stakeholders throughout 2020, including meetings with shareholders, Traditional Owners, Indigenous leaders, civil society and governments. During the year, I held one-on-one meetings with over 70 key shareholders. Together with the Board Committee chairs, we also arranged two governance-focused engagements in the UK and Australia hosted by the Investor Forum and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors. Our annual supplier and customer survey showed improved perceptions of our performance, as well as a number of areas requiring\n\nThe strength and resilience of our business enabled us to protect thousands of jobs across our supply chain, and continue to pay taxes and royalties to governments and dividends to pension funds, when many other companies were forced to cut/uni00A0back.\n\nfurther attention. We also held a 'virtual roundtable' with civil society organisations, where the discussions focused on our response to Juukan Gorge, climate change and continuing concerns about industry lobbying.\n\nIn the aftermath of Juukan Gorge, I held a virtual town hall with senior managers worldwide and a real town hall with employees in Perth. Board members also held a series of meetings with smaller groups of leaders around the world, and made a 'virtual site visit' to Oyu Tolgoi, during which we were able to speak to our employees and partners in/uni00A0Mongolia.\n\nIn these meetings, our employees spoke openly and honestly about their pride in the company's response to COVID-19 and their deep sense of shock at the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters. A key topic for discussion was how we can make the work culture at Rio Tinto more diverse and inclusive, to ensure that everyone feels empowered to speak up if something does not feel right. This will be a strong area of focus for the Board and leadership team in 2021.\n\n## Restoring our reputation as a purpose-led business\n\nAs Jakob takes over as Chief Executive, he takes charge of a company with outstanding people, world class assets, an exceptionally strong /financial position, a clear climate change strategy and a robust safety culture. But he also inherits a company that urgently needs to restore trust with host communities and in our management of cultural/uni00A0heritage.\n\nOur purpose is to produce materials essential to human progress. We are committed to doing so ef/ficiently, effectively and sustainably, creating value for all stakeholders while safeguarding the environment and respecting our host countries and communities.\n\n## Thank you\n\nLet me end by thanking the leadership team and the many thousands of Rio Tinto employees, contractors and partners who delivered once again for our company and its shareholders during one of the most dif/ficult and challenging years in recent memory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nChairman\n\n22 February 2021",

        "page_content": "## Juukan Gorge\n\n## A breach of our values\n\nWe apologise unreservedly to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people, and to people across Australia and beyond, for the destruction of Juukan Gorge.\n\nIn allowing the destruction of Juukan Gorge to occur, we fell far short of our values as a company and breached the trust placed in us by the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we operate. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the destruction of a site of such exceptional cultural signi/ficance never happens again, to earn back the trust that has been lost and to re-establish our leadership in communities and social performance.\n\n## A nearly two-decade-long timeline\n\nOur relationship with the PKKP people extends over more than 17 years, with initial agreements covering our operations on PKKP land at Brockman 4 signed in 2006 and 2011. The decision to destroy the rock shelters was taken nearly eight years ago but, because mining is such a long-cycle industry, that decision was not actually implemented until 2020.\n\nInternal and external reviews of the events leading to the blasting of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge have highlighted de/ficiencies in how our partnership with the PKKP people was managed, a lack of integration of our heritage management with our front-line operational teams, and a work culture that was too focused on business performance and not enough on building and maintaining relationships with Traditional Owners.\n\nThe archaeological and ethnographic reports received in 2013/14 should have triggered an internal review of the implications of this material new information for the mine development plans. Such a review did not take place. Following completion of the archaeological surveys and other mitigation measures agreed with the PKKP people in 2014, the site was reclassi/fied as 'cleared' for mining and removed from relevant risk registers. As a consequence, knowledge and awareness of the location and signi/ficance of the site was progressively lost. Further opportunities to revise the mine plan were missed in 2018, when the /final archaeological report was received, and again during 2019/20.\n\n## Remedy process\n\nWe are engaging with the PKKP people to determine an appropriate remedy process for the destruction of the rock shelters. This includes providing funding to support their submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia (the Parliamentary Inquiry) and their effective participation in discussions about how we rebuild and strengthen our partnership and provide a remedy that respects the wishes of these Traditional Owners.\n\nA moratorium has been agreed on mining in the Juukan Gorge area and work is underway on a remediation plan. In partnership with the PKKP people, we are focusing on understanding how, through the remediation of the Gorge, we can re-establish a sense of place that recognises the exceptional cultural signi/ficance and connection of the Juukan Gorge area to past, current, and future PKKP people as well as their aspirations for future use and interaction with the place.\n\nRemediation of the Gorge will be a challenging project. While the Juukan 2 rock shelter is likely to be irreparably damaged, Juukan 1 appears to be largely intact. Both shelters will be restored to the fullest extent possible and, if it is safe, access will be re-established. Other parts of the Gorge, including the Snake pool, which were not impacted by the blast, will remain protected and its connection to the Juukan 1 and 2 rock shelters will be re-established.\n\nArtefacts and other materials salvaged from the rock shelters during archaeological excavations have already been moved to a purpose-built conservation facility. Discussions are in progress with the PKKP people on the provision of an appropriate, permanent 'keeping place'.\n\nFor a more detailed summary of our response to the recommendations issued by the Parliamentary Inquiry, please visit riotinto.com. Please refer to pages 114-115 to learn more about the Board review of the events that led to Juukan Gorge.\n\n## Ensuring this never happens again\n\nWe have taken decisive action to strengthen our processes and approach to cultural heritage.\n\n## Governance\n\n- -Integrated Heritage Management Process (IHMP): The most urgent task was to ensure that we do not have other sites of exceptional cultural signi/ficance within our existing mine plans. We are currently completing the /first phase of a new IHMP, which is being rolled out at our Pilbara iron ore business. The lessons from the IHMP will subsequently be implemented across our business globally while taking into account local circumstances. In the Pilbara, the IHMP involves a systematic review of all the heritage sites that we manage starting with those that may be impacted by our activities over the next two years. So far, we have reviewed over 1,000 sites and ranked each one by: (i) cultural signi/ficance (which is informed through consultation with the Traditional Owners of the land on which we operate); (ii) our re-con/firmation that we have recently consulted with Traditional Owners for potential impacts; and (iii) the materiality of the impact. Where there is any doubt, we have reclassi/fied the relevant sites from 'cleared' for mining back to 'protected' as a precautionary measure, pending further consultation with the Traditional Owners.\n- -Empowering operational management: We have increased the responsibility of our product groups for Communities and Social Performance (CSP), partnerships and engagement. This means that line managers within the product groups directly own the relationships with host communities, including Indigenous peoples. All community and heritage management professionals at our operations now report to product group line management.\n- -Improved governance and Board oversight: Any direct impacts to sites categorised as being of 'high' or 'very high' signi/ficance under the new Integrated Heritage Management Process must also be approved by the heritage sub-committee of the Executive Committee",

        "page_content": "- or the Board, as appropriate. The Sustainability Committee of the Board will oversee the implementation of the recommendations arising from the Board Review and the Parliamentary Inquiry and will ensure that lessons learned are applied, as appropriate to our operations worldwide. The/uni00A0Audit Committee of the Board will ensure that relevant lessons from Juukan Gorge are also applied to all other risk management processes, particularly those, like Juukan Gorge, where there is a signi/ficant lag between decision and implementation. Please refer to the risk management and internal control section on page 115 of this report for more information.\n- -Strengthened assurance: Second line assurance will be provided by a new stand-alone CSP Area of Expertise (AoE), reporting to Mark Davies, our Group Executive, Safety, Technical and Projects, a member of our Executive Committee, based in Brisbane. The CSP AoE will ensure conformance with Group policies, standards and procedures, including the new Integrated Heritage Management Process, and will share best practice worldwide. The new CSP AoE sits alongside the existing health, safety, environment (HSE) function. This will help to ensure that communities and heritage risk processes are aligned with our existing robust health, safety and environmental systems. The AoE will also oversee internal assessments and reviews, including deep dives and operational reviews in conjunction with experts from our Group Risk function. The framework includes a rigorous annual self-assessment and certi/fication of impacts and risks. Internal Audit will provide a third line of defence.\n- -Modernisation of agreements with Traditional Owners: We have written to Traditional Owners advising them that we will not enforce any clauses that restrict Traditional Owners from raising concerns about cultural heritage matters or that restrict them from applying for statutory protection of any cultural heritage sites. We have also offered to modernise agreements in the Pilbara where Traditional Owners have indicated that the current agreements have not met the aspirations of partnership we mutually sought at the outset. We will seek to agree an appropriate mechanism in our revised agreements so that there is a clear pathway for resolution of any differences of view that may emerge. We will also continue to work with Traditional Owners to increase the economic bene/fits that /flow to their communities from employment, skills, training and business development.\n- -Increasing transparency: Subject to the consent of Traditional Owners in Australia, we intend to make our new agreements public. We intend to engage with the Traditional Owners on how independent input can be sought to support this modernisation process.\n- -Indigenous Advisory Group: We are consulting with Traditional Owners to create an Indigenous Advisory Group (IAG), intended to bring Indigenous voices into the senior leadership and oversight of the business in Australia. An IAG would provide direct input on our Indigenous strategy in Australia and coaching, mentoring and advice to senior leadership and, where possible, to the Board.\n\n## Work culture and relationships\n\nMaking sure that we have the right work culture and relationships will require sustained effort over many years. We are not underestimating the time it will take to build a more inclusive work culture that better recognises and celebrates Indigenous partnership in our business.\n\n- -Increasing awareness and understanding of community and heritage issues: Operational leadership will receive training and coaching to ensure that they understand their new responsibilities and have access to the subject matter experts and information they need to support good decision-making. They will be encouraged to invest time in building relationships with Traditional Owners to ensure that they are aware of any concerns, before they escalate into major issues. To support them, we are reinvigorating our cultural awareness training, with all frontline staff, including the Board, undertaking both e-learning and face to face training with Indigenous Australians.\n- -Fostering Australian Indigenous leadership: In order to increase the diversity of our leadership team, we have appointed a Chief Advisor, Indigenous Affairs, reporting directly to our Chief Executive Australia, and committed a US$50 million investment to advance employment opportunities and accelerate the career development of Indigenous Australians in our business. The Chief Advisor, Indigenous Affairs will also assist and coach operational management in the renegotiation of our agreements with Traditional Owners.\n- -Building a more inclusive work culture: It is clear that we need to create a more inclusive, more diverse work culture, where people feel empowered to challenge decisions - a priority of the management team and our new Chief Executive.\n\n## External engagement\n\nIn parallel with these internal changes, we continue to contribute to the reform of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA), making clear our support for a right of appeal by Traditional Owners in relation to approvals to impact cultural heritage sites on their Country. We are also engaging with the Chamber of Minerals and Energy in Western Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the ICMM, sharing the lessons that we have learned from Juukan Gorge.",

Important progress has been made following a meeting between the PKKP and Rio Tinto boards, as articulated in the December joint statement at riotinto.com/juukangorge. We are also developing additional measures to strengthen our partnerships with Traditional Owners in Australia, including a commitment to modernise and improve agreements in the Pilbara, home to our iron ore business.

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's Statement\n\n## continued\n\n## A strong safety culture\n\nI believe a company's culture is the foundation from which its performance is built; our strong safety culture allowed us to deliver a second year with zero fatalities. While we cannot stop improving, this is an important milestone - one never achieved until 2019. I would like to personally thank the many thousands of employees, contractors and partners whose dedication and commitment made it possible. But there is more to do. While our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) of 0.37, is considered industry-leading, we had too many serious safety incidents. Our focus in 2021 will therefore be on further maturing our safety system, which will lead to overall improvements in our safety performance and, at the same time, improve our operations.\n\nI am exceptionally proud of the way we responded, as one, to the global COVID-19 pandemic: our goal was to keep our employees, contractors and communities safe and healthy while keeping our operations running and continuing to deliver the products our customers need. At our Pilbara iron ore business, for example, in a matter of days, we redesigned rosters and changed our /fly-in, /fly-out (FIFO) travel schedules for thousands of employees. We secured additional charter /flights, ensuring compliance with social distancing guidelines by spacing workers appropriately on planes, and in airports. With the implementation of rapid screening at airports in Western Australia for our FIFO workforce, we were one of the /first companies globally to implement large scale rapid screening.\n\nMany of our employees made signi/ficant sacri/fices this year - often being away from families and loved ones for extended periods of time - to allow our company to continue to perform during the pandemic. In Mongolia, for example, some of our employees took what they thought would be a domestic, overnight trip but, due to in-country pandemic travel restrictions, were instead required to spend 21 days in quarantine and 14/uni00A0days in self-isolation. The pandemic has required incredible resilience, and our employees have/uni00A0delivered.\n\nI also want to thank our host governments, which actively supported us and allowed our operations to keep running - and in doing so, allowed their citizens and economies to bene/fit.\n\n## Juukan Gorge: a breach of our values\n\nOne of the reasons I was excited to join Rio Tinto, two years ago, was our ambition on sustainability, our values, our history - and our purpose: to produce materials essential to human progress. We know we must ful/fil this purpose in way that is in line with our values.\n\nIn Australia, in 1995, our company was the /first mining company to embrace Native Title - the recognition of Indigenous people's traditional land and water rights and interests. Our destruction of the 46,000-yearold rockshelters at Juukan Gorge, in Western Australia, was a breach of that leadership and our values. Alongside our Board, management team and employees, I extend my deep apologies to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. We are determined to listen, learn and change, and to ensure that cultural heritage sites of exceptional signi/ficance, like the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, are never again destroyed. We must earn the right to become a trusted partner once more for Traditional Owners, host communities, governments and other stakeholders. Please refer to pages 10-11 to learn more about the actions we are taking.\n\nOn a more personal note, the events at Juukan Gorge have taken their toll on many of us. Many of our employees are disappointed and feel let down. I am also sorry for this. We are working hard to heal and rebuild our relationships, credibility and reputation, and I know this will take time and effort. I believe we all have a role to play and, together, we will learn.\n\nOne thing we must do more is put ourselves in others' shoes - to better understand their views, improve the way we do things, and make this a better, more caring company, and one in tune with the world we serve. This culture must be actively practised and promoted by our leaders. It needs to be felt by our employees. And it needs to be closely and regularly monitored by our Executive Committee and Board. This is one of my top priorities.\n\n## A strong /financial performance\n\nWe are proud that, despite exceptionally challenging circumstances, we delivered a resilient operating performance this year that enabled strong /financial results: underlying earnings of $12.4 billion, underlying EBITDA of $23.9 billion and free cash /flow of $9.4 billion. We recognise these strong results are driven by the current pricing environment across a number of our commodities, particularly iron ore; nevertheless, our ability to keep operations running amidst a global pandemic was also a critical factor.\n\nNet debt further reduced to $0.7 billion (2019: $3.7 billion), underpinning an already strong balance sheet providing both resilience and optionality. As a result, the Board has recommended a /final ordinary dividend of 309 US cents per share and a special dividend of 93 US cents per share, resulting in total shareholder returns declared this year of $9 billion.\n\n## Sustainability in sharp focus\n\nWe are working hard to strengthen our cultural heritage processes, including placing accountability for our relationships with Traditional Owners with our operational leaders. We are also investing $50 million to increase and nurture Indigenous leadership across our operations in/uni00A0Australia.\n\nWe made progress across other parts of our business as well. In December, for example, the Iron Ore Company of Canada signed a Reconciliation and Collaboration Agreement with the Innu communities of Uashat mak Mani-utenam and Matimekush-Lac John, re-con/firming the long-term partnership between the company and the two communities over the coming decades.\n\nWe consider climate change the key challenge of our generation, and have pledged to address our own emissions, and those of our value chain. Last year, we set Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets: to reduce our absolute emissions by 15% by 2030 and emissions intensity by 30% (from 2018 levels). These targets are supported by our commitment to spend approximately $1 billion on climate-related projects from 2020-24.\n\nThis year, we set new Scope 3 emissions reduction goals, focused mostly on our contribution to the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies, as well as new goals and targets related to emissions from shipping our products: we will work with customers on steel decarbonisation pathways and invest in technologies that could deliver at least a 30% reduction in steelmaking carbon intensity from 2030. We will work with our partners to develop breakthrough technologies with the potential to deliver carbon neutral steelmaking pathways by 2050. We will continue to work to scale up breakthrough technology enabling the production of zero-carbon aluminium. And we will develop programmes to meet our new ambition to reach, by 2050, net zero emissions from the shipping of our products.",

This investment will fund the joint establishment of a Low Carbon Raw Materials Preparation R&D Centre, which will initially prioritise developing lower carbon ore preparation processes.\n\nWe also signed a memorandum of understanding with Nippon Steel Corporation, in Japan, to jointly explore a breadth of technologies to decarbonise the entire steel value chain from iron ore mining to steelmaking. Please refer to our climate change report, available on our website, to learn more about our approach to climate change and our progress against targets.\n\nWith respect to our products, our copper joined our aluminium this year in being third-party-certi/fied as responsible: metal from both the Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi mines has been awarded the prestigious Copper Mark certi/fication.\n\nAs detailed in the sustainability section of this report, we are also working to strengthen other aspects of our work - from biodiversity to human rights, communities to water. This too, is a personal priority of mine; we plan to report on our progress regularly and transparently.\n\n## A look forward\n\nIn early 2021, I announced our new Executive Committee, which will help deliver strong safety and operational performance and make our company more resilient, an even stronger performer and employer and a trusted partner for host communities, governments and other stakeholders. This newly-formed Executive Committee is referenced on pages 118-119 of this report. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the team on their new roles. I would also like to sincerely thank Vera Kirikova, who will leave Rio Tinto in early 2021, for her signi/ficant contributions to our company over many years.\n\nAs we look to the months and years ahead, we know we have a lot of hard work ahead of us. Still, we can look forward to the future of a company that is today as essential to human progress as at any time in its history. Our operations are safe, ef/ficient and well-run. Our customers are reliably served with high-quality products. Our balance sheet is strong, and our employees have proven they can succeed even in dif/ficult conditions. All/uni00A0of these things make Rio Tinto well-placed to continue to generate superior returns for our shareholders, invest in sustaining, innovating and growing our business and continue to pay taxes and royalties to host communities and governments - all while creating jobs and partnering with local businesses.\n\nBut none of this will be possible without the dedication and hard work of our many thousands of employees and contractors. To them, to host governments and communities, our customers and our many partners, all of whom make our success possible, I say - thank you.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJakob Stausholm\n\nChief Executive\n\n22 February 2021",

We consider new commodities and products with an understanding of customers' and communities' needs. We are also mindful of our potential future social and environmental impact as well as the diversity and balance of our portfolio.\n\n## Develop and innovate\n\nWe assess each potential operation with a focus on risk, potential returns, and long-term value and sustainability. Once we have approved an investment, we design and build each operation, informed by input from those stakeholders most affected. We aim to develop every potential site to achieve optimal, long-term productivity while minimising risks.\n\nWe work in partnership with a growing network of stakeholders - governments, communities, customers and suppliers - who help expand our thinking, understanding, capabilities and, ultimately, our ability to deliver mutual bene/fit.\n\n## Mine and process\n\nA safe site is a productive site, and advanced technologies are playing a more important role in how we achieve both. We share best practices across our assets to create safe, environmentally responsible working practices and a high-performing culture that targets production at lower costs. At the same time, our operations aim to bene/fit local economies by contributing jobs, taxes and royalties, contracts with local businesses, and social and community investment. We also support the economic diversi/fication of regions where we are based, in alignment with national and local government plans, ensuring host communities can thrive long after our operations close. Our ambition is for our operations to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nBy understanding and respecting our business partners, employees, communities and the environment, we can create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Market and deliver\n\nOur minerals and metals are essential to the transition to a low-carbon future and are used in a vast array of everyday products - from cars to coffee pods to smartphones. Our commercial team ensures that we align our products with market and customer needs. And our network of rail, ports and ships means that we can control end-to-end logistics to deliver our products safely, ef/ficiently and reliably.\n\n## Repurpose and renew\n\nWe aim to design and run our assets to create a positive legacy once our mining activity concludes. We engage stakeholders of our sites nearing closure - including Indigenous peoples, government, employees and host communities - and actively involve them in/uni00A0planning.\n\nApplying this approach could entail rehabilitating the land for a nature reserve, for example, or repurposing it for light industrial use. Each of our sites has rehabilitation plans that we review every year. We see this long-term approach - planning and operating with the future in mind - as integral to running a safe, responsible and pro/fitable business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Disciplined capital allocation\n\nOur business is underpinned by a disciplined approach to capital allocation; we strive to use every dollar prudently.

Always. Safely looking after the environment is an essential part of our care for future generations.\n\n## Teamwork\n\n## Collaborating for success\n\nWe work together with colleagues, partners and communities globally to deliver the products our customers need. We learn from each other to improve our performance and achieve success.\n\n## Integrity\n\n## Respect\n\n## Fostering inclusion and embracing diversity\n\nWe recognise and respect diverse cultures, communities and points of view. We treat each other with fairness and dignity to make the most of everyone's contributions.\n\n## Excellence\n\n## Having the courage and commitment to do the right thing\n\nWe do the right thing, even when this is challenging. We take ownership of what we do and say. And we are honest and clear with each other, and with everyone we work with. This helps us to build trust.\n\n## Our Culture\n\nWe de/fine culture as the system of beliefs and values that guides our behaviours across our diverse organisation. Our culture helped us achieve zero fatalities for two years running, and it underpins our ability to innovate and deliver high-quality products to our customers - reliably - even through a global pandemic.\n\nBut we know that aspects of our culture have let us, and our many stakeholders, down - and these aspects must be improved. The Board Review of the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, published in August, made clear that parts of our business lack connectedness in organisational structures, decision-making, openness and depth of engagement with Traditional Owners. They also have rigid processes and systems, constrained resourcing of key areas and dif/ficulty escalating unresolved issues. None of these is aligned with the values we espouse or the standards we set for ourselves.\n\n## Being the best we can be for superior performance\n\nWe challenge ourselves and others to create lasting value and achieve high performance. We adopt a pioneering mindset and aim to do better every day.\n\nWe are therefore making changes to our structure, to the way we interact with each other, the way we run certain processes, make decisions and allocate funds and time, and to elevate our approach to social performance, including respect for cultural heritage, to the same level as health, safety and environment. The choices we are making in these areas seek to both re/flect and embed the values we uphold.\n\nWe will continue to work across the organisation to ensure our values are re/flected in the behaviours we demonstrate - every shift, every day. We are also making an investment in developing our leaders' cultural awareness, through training programmes and diversity in leadership, and their ability to engage respectfully and effectively with Traditional Owners and other First Nations groups. And, as this company begins its next chapter, our management team is committed to re-setting and evolving the culture of our nearly-150-year-old company.",

        "page_content": "## Our Stakeholders\n\nOur business touches the lives and livelihoods of many people around the world. We recognise our responsibility to listen to - and hear - their views and take account of their interests.\n\n## Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis year, our employees faced unique challenges, from working through the COVID-19 pandemic to the sober re/flection required by the global movements for social justice and in the aftermath of Juukan Gorge.\n\nTo understand employees' views on how to make our business better, we held virtual focus groups with almost 1,000 people from our sites and of/fices. Sessions were set aside speci/fically for Indigenous employees, employees of Asian heritage, Black employees, female employees and LGBTI+ employees. We heard our employees' appreciation of our response to COVID-19, their disappointment with the company on Juukan Gorge - and their views on many other topics, ranging from work culture, inclusion and diversity, the desired qualities of the new Chief Executive and the importance of sustainability. These sessions were supported by a series of engagements held in November by the Chairman and some of the non-executive directors.\n\nIn our most recent employee survey, conducted in November, we saw that, despite a year that tested employees in many ways, we maintained a high level of engagement overall. For the second time in a row, our employee net promoter score (eNPS) is in positive territory and currently sits at +5, one point higher than last year and the highest since we began our survey in 2016. And our employee satisfaction (eSAT) and recommend scores are also at their highest, each moving up a point to 73 and 72, respectively.\n\nIt is clear we have work to do. Our current priorities include improving overall safety performance and health, particularly during COVID-19 restrictions; transforming our culture to make it more inclusive and welcoming of diverse and/or dissenting perspectives, including women and Indigenous voices; continuing to offer competitive pay and bene/fits and ensuring a reasonable work-life balance, including a focus on strengthening mental health.\n\n## Communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommunities are the places where we operate, where we live, and work, and call home - from the Pilbara, Western Australia, to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada. But more than that, communities are made up of people - employees, Indigenous peoples, suppliers and neighbours - with whom we strive to build long-term, positive partnerships. Our strength is built upon their strength.\n\nWe recognise that, in parts of our business, we have work to do to meet our own standards on open, transparent engagement. We continue to strive to engage consistently and honestly with communities on a number of issues: from jobs and local procurement to the impact of our operations on the local environment.\n\nThis year, we established a communities and social performance (CSP) Area of Expertise (AoE), which will deliver a more rigorous assurance framework across our operations and elevate communities risk processes to align with our health and safety systems. We also changed the way we structure our global CSP teams, so that product group and operational leaders directly own relationships with their host communities, including Indigenous peoples. We have taken decisive action to strengthen our processes and approach to cultural heritage. We are currently completing the /first phase of a new Integrated Heritage Management Process (IHMP), which is being rolled out at our Pilbara iron ore business. The lessons from the IHMP will subsequently be implemented across our business globally while taking into account local circumstances.\n\n## Civil society\n\nCivil society organisations, whether local or global, play an important role in our society and in the governance of the world's natural resources. We/uni00A0believe that preventing and addressing the world's many complex, multifaceted environmental, social and governance challenges, such as climate change, human rights violations and bribery and corruption, can only be achieved through genuine dialogue and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders.\n\nAs a result, we regularly engage civil society organisations and, although we acknowledge instances in which our opinions may differ, we genuinely respect their views and the role they play in communities and in our business. Since 2018, we have held annual civil society roundtables to listen, learn and understand how we can improve. In 2020, we partnered with many organisations to help our communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed matters of cultural heritage with many civil society organisations.\n\n## Governments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernments - federal, state and provincial, and local - are also critical stakeholders for our business. We regularly engage of/ficials at all three levels on matters from how we explore, mine and process ore, to conditions of land tenure, and health, safety and environmental requirements, as well as how we operate as a company in relation to securities, taxation, intellectual property, competition and foreign investment, provisions to protect data privacy, conditions of trade and export and infrastructure access.\n\nA key item of discussion is the economic contribution our business makes to governments around the world: a decade ago, we were the /first company in our industry to disclose our payments to governments in detail, and we have been reporting on our taxes and royalties paid, and our economic contribution, in increasing detail ever since.\n\nOver the past ten years we have paid more than $71 billion in taxes and royalties globally; more than 75%, or $54 billion, was paid in Australia. In 2020, the Rio Tinto Group paid more than $8 billion in taxes and royalties globally. In Australia, where we are one of the largest taxpayers, we contributed more than $6.5 billion in taxes and royalties.\n\nThis is important because our businesses and the funds we provide to governments and communities support the basic infrastructure of society - bridges and roads, schools and hospitals - as well as other local development priorities, like job creation and skills training. This is one, very important way we ful/fil our purpose: to produce materials essential to human progress. Being transparent about where these payments go helps our stakeholders better understand how these funds may be used to deliver economic and social bene/fit through our business.\n\nAt the global level, we also engage international state-based organisations from the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation to the United Nations to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as key multi-stakeholder initiatives in which governments participate, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. These bodies also help de/fine the industry operating environment and contribute to joint problem-solving.",

They have trusted us with their investment and, in return, they expect a /financial return. But they are increasingly focused on how that return is made. They want to invest in companies that behave responsibly across environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures.\n\nWe engaged with current and potential investors through virtual forums for the majority of 2020, providing an opportunity for meetings with executive directors, the Chairman and non-executive directors. Additionally, our two annual general meetings (AGMs) in the UK and Australia provide an opportunity for all investors to question and engage with the Board. The Board also commissioned an independent perception study in April, seeking the views of institutional investors representing around 40% of the active Rio Tinto register in the US, the UK and Australia.\n\nGiven the growing importance of issues such as climate change, governance, social performance and environment, we present and engage regularly on these topics. In April, we held a sustainability seminar focused on our approach to climate and water management. Members of the executive team and subject matter experts provided an update on progress with our climate change strategy and our water management focus areas, including targets for both topics.\n\nThe Chairman and other non-executive directors engaged extensively with investors following the events at Juukan Gorge. Following the Board Review of Cultural Heritage Management, and extensive consultation with our global investor base, the Board announced changes to the Executive Committee in September. The company has moved with pace to take a number of actions to strengthen cultural heritage governance and controls, including an enhanced level of governance over the impact on sites of heritage signi/ficance.\n\nThe Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also consulted with investors in 2020 on proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy, due/uni00A0for renewal at the 2021 AGMs.\n\nTwo governance-focused engagements were also held by the Chairman and our Board Committee Chairs in December, facilitated by the Investor Forum (in the UK) and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI).\n\nWe intend to hold further environmental, social and governance forums in 2021 in response to growing investor interest in the company's progress in a number of areas including climate change, heritage and communities, closure and environment.\n\n## Customers & Suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe could not produce materials essential to human progress without our suppliers, who help us at every stage of our business. Our customers turn them into the products upon which the modern world is built. We recognise that building trust with these critical stakeholders, and keeping it, requires us to deliver on our promises consistently, and to act with transparency, respect and integrity.\n\nWe use deep insights generated from everything we buy, sell and move around the world to ensure the needs of our customers are central to our operational decision making. Through the volatility of 2020, we engaged customers and suppliers to safely maintain our operations and the uninterrupted /flow of materials and products through the value chain. The disruption of COVID-19 also gave us the opportunity to accelerate and expand our use of digital solutions - such as offering customers the opportunity to buy our products through a mobile app and conducting end-to-end digital transactions using blockchain technology.\n\nWe also continue to engage with our iron ore customers, such as Baowu Steel in China and Nippon Steel Corporation in Japan, to tackle emissions across the steel value chain - and to work with others, like AB InBev, to help make their supply chains more sustainable through the use of our low-carbon, Canadian aluminium. In 2020, our Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi operations were the /first and second producers globally to be awarded the 'Copper Mark', the industry's new independently assessed responsible production programme.\n\nSuppliers are also an important way we have a positive impact on communities: in 2020, we spent $15.5 billion with suppliers globally, including A$8.2 billion in Western Australia, and A$293 million with Indigenous suppliers across Australia. In Mongolia, between 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2020, Oyu Tolgoi spent $3.54 billion on national procurement (a) .\n\nThis year, we introduced new payment terms in Australia to ensure smaller suppliers are paid quickly. As a result of the new policy, approximately 90% of our suppliers in Australia are paid within 20 days.\n\n- (a)  Oyu Tolgoi's (OT) national procurement /figure represents spend with suppliers registered in Mongolia and more than 50% owned by Mongolian citizens. It relates to the OT operations only, and does not include the underground project.\n\nThere is more detailed information on our stakeholder engagement in the Sustainability section on pages 62-91 and we set out how the Board takes account of stakeholder interests (our 'section 172(1) Statement') in the Governance section on pages 122-123.\n\nWe meet with the Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) group regularly at the Board, Executive Committee and climate team levels, and we value their co-ordination of investor engagement.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to join investors in the development and implementation of net zero transition action plans. As a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, we will work towards disclosures consistent with the evolving CA100+ benchmark and intend to put our annual TCFD-aligned reporting to an advisory vote at our 2022 annual general meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Geopolitics\n\nWe have witnessed an evolution in the global geopolitical context over the past few years, marked by an erosion of global trust in elites and institutions, a backlash in some quarters against globalisation and a marked shift in the relationship between the United States and China. The growing sense of a fragmenting world order has been exacerbated by the unco-ordinated response to the COVID-19 global/uni00A0pandemic.\n\nTensions between the United States and China have become more structurally ingrained, reaching beyond trade into broader issues such as technological leadership and access to data. The pandemic has also accentuated concerns about security of the global supply chain, including for critical minerals, and self-suf/ficiency. Still, the economies of the United States and China remain closely intertwined and, despite growing talks of decoupling, this new era of competition will be shaped as much by how and where both countries agree to co-operate.\n\nOther countries, including many in which we operate such as Australia, face the conundrum of how to position their economic and foreign policies towards the United States and China, knowing that how they do so will have implications for global growth and trade, both of which are critical to the outlook of the mining sector.\n\nFor Rio Tinto, balancing the relationships we have with our host country governments, as well as other stakeholders, alongside those we have with China as a key customer and supplier, market, technology partner and shareholder, is one of our top strategic priorities.\n\n## Society\n\nThe initial economic shock from the global pandemic has been sharper than the 2008 global /financial crisis (GFC). And, as with the GFC, its impact has been uneven, particularly in countries that lack social safety nets and in low-income service sectors in which social distancing and remote working are dif/ficult.\n\nSocial movements, such as Black Lives Matter, are not a product of the pandemic, but the global context and the shared, digitally-connected lockdown experience have facilitated linking local issues to a global narrative. Societal expectation for social equality, fairness and sustainability is today an increasingly powerful force.\n\nThe aftermath of the GFC saw a rising wave of populist sentiment. As the world turns to the rebuilding of the global economy after the pandemic, governments are facing growing calls for a new social contract.\n\nIn China, growth has been central to social stability, and, with the country now past its phase of rapid economic development, a broader focus may be needed, as indicated by President Xi Jinping's recent commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060. However, with budget de/ficits in several countries already approaching World War II levels, it will be dif/ficult to close the gap between societal expectations and governments' ability to deliver.\n\nTaken together, this dynamic promises to only increase pressures on businesses and the /financial sector to step up their sustainability credentials. This is certainly true for our sector. The integration of sustainability, including cultural heritage, local economic contribution and climate change, into our strategy is another of our key strategic priorities.\n\n## Technology\n\nDigital connectivity has been a de/fining feature of how the world adapted to life during a global pandemic. Investment and adoption rates in digital communication tools have leapt forward, upending traditional ways of working. This will likely have long-lasting effects on the future of work, cities and transport.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the rapid digitalisation of work will boost medium-term global economic productivity and growth. But there is no doubt that increased online focus, across sectors, is helping to accelerate and concentrate wealth towards owners and operators of global digital platforms, adding another strand to concerns about economic inequality.\n\nIn addition, the development and cost reduction of low-carbon technologies is an ongoing trend that may further bene/fit from pandemic stimulus packages targeted at 'building back better' and advancing a green recovery. This in turn promises to accelerate the global energy transition - and therefore, potentially, future climate outcomes.\n\nIn the mining sector, technology has an important role to play in addressing productivity, growth and sustainability challenges. This is another core element to our strategy; our approach is to look for the best solutions through partnerships with our suppliers, technology providers and others across our value chains.",

In 2021, we will also begin producing scandium oxide at a new plant in Quebec, Canada. Please refer to pages 40 to 41 for more on these growth projects, and pages 54 to 57 for more on our scandium oxide plant.\n\nWe have also announced a new electricity agreement that makes the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter, operated by New Zealand Aluminium Smelter (NZAS), economically viable and competitive over the next four years. The smelter will continue operating until 31 December 2024, providing certainty to employees, the local community and customers while providing more time for all stakeholders to plan for the future.\n\nWork to progress ELYSIS\u2122 - our joint venture with Alcoa that aims to eliminate direct greenhouse gases from the aluminium smelting process, launched with the support of the governments of Canada and Quebec - also continued this year with the completion of its Research & Development Centre in the Saguenay, Quebec.\n\n## 20%\n\nof the global scandium oxide market to be met by our new plant in Quebec, Canada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People\n\n## Building capability to drive performance\n\nAttracting, developing and retaining the best people is crucial to our success. We continue to strengthen our technical and commercial capabilities through our Centres of Excellence, and are committed to building an inclusive and diverse workforce across our global business.\n\nWe have said that our company must become more representative of the communities in which we operate and the world we serve. Ultimately, we aspire to an environment where all aspects and dimensions of diversity are represented. In Australia, we have committed $50 million to increasing Indigenous leadership. In 2021, we will also focus on improving the representation of women.\n\nWomen currently comprise approximately 20% of our workforce; we have increased the number of women in our senior leadership roles, from 19% to 26% in /five years, an increase of 35%. But we are not where we want to be on any measure. And we know when we make an effort, women respond - a recent recruitment drive in Western Australia resulted in more than 2,000 applications from women for 100 jobs. And so, in 2021, we aim to do better.\n\nUltimately, we want to achieve a gender balance across our business of at least 40% women. But we recognise that will take time, and so for the /first time, in 2021 we will have a target to increase female representation at Rio Tinto by 2% - or nearly 900 more women at all levels.

We aim to generate value from mine to market and also to prioritise value over volume in our investment decisions. We work to maximise value in other ways - for example, by developing new markets for our materials, including as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy. We focus on operational excellence to improve ef/ficiency.\n\nThis year was marked by strong performance. Our strong safety culture allowed us to deliver a second year with zero fatalities, with an all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) of 0.37, marking a year-on-year improvement. However, we recognise there is more to do.\n\nThanks to the signi/ficant sacri/fices of many of our employees and the actions of host governments, we responded well to the global COVID-19 pandemic, acting to keep our employees, contractors and communities safe and healthy while keeping our operations running, continuing to deliver the products our customers need.\n\nDespite challenging circumstances, we delivered a resilient /financial performance in 2020, with underlying earnings of $12.4 billion, underlying EBITDA of $23.9 billion and free cash /flow of $9.4 billion.

We work closely with technology partners, local suppliers, governments, community groups, industry leaders and civil society organisations at all stages of the mining lifecycle, from exploration to rehabilitation and closure. We believe this gives us a competitive edge and also allows us to work more thoughtfully and responsibly, and to deliver real bene/fits to all our stakeholders.\n\nThis year, we added the word 'partnership' to our strategy statement, in recognition of the critical role our partners play in our performance across a variety of metrics. As part of our climate change strategy, for example, we signed a series of agreements (see page 79) with partners in China and Japan to address emissions across the steel value chain, in which our iron ore plays an important role.\n\nIn Canada, we signed a historic agreement between the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the communities of Uashat mak Mani-utenam and Matimekush-Lac John, in Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, two of our First Nations communities and partners. Through this partnership, nearly two years in the making, we will support local education and jobs, and preserve the environment, unique customs and cultural practices of both communities. The agreement is called Ussiniun, or 'renewal', in the Innu language, and it marks both a new beginning and a shared commitment to a strong future.\n\nOur partnerships were also affected by our destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge (see pages 114 to 115). Our work to earn back the trust we have lost, with the PKKP people, other Traditional Owners, Indigenous leaders and many other partners, in Australia and elsewhere, is one of our most important priorities this year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2019, we introduced the safety maturity model and safety coaching framework. These programmes focus on building strong safety culture and leadership capability through the line.

This allows us to return cash to shareholders (short-term returns) while investing in the business (long-term returns).\n\nUnderlying earnings of $12.4 billion were $2.1 billion higher than in 2019. Underlying EBITDA of $23.9 billion was $2.7 billion higher than 2019. The 13% increase in underlying EBITDA resulted from higher iron ore and copper prices and lower energy costs, partly offset by lower prices for aluminium, movements in sales volumes and changes in product mix across the portfolio and higher operating cash/uni00A0costs.\n\n## Forward plan\n\nWe will continue to drive superior margins and returns through a focus on operational and commercial excellence and our value over volume approach.\n\n## Associated risks focus (see page 95):\n\n- -Economic\n- -Strategic\n- -ESG\n\n## Associated risks focus (see page 95):\n\n- -Economic\n- -Operational\n- -ESG",

After a number of years of limited progress, this result represents signi/ficant focus on both attraction and retention of senior women in our organisation.\n\n## Forward plan\n\nIn 2021, we will focus on improving the representation of women, who comprise half the world's population but only about 20% of our workforce. We do this because we aim to have our company re/flect the perspectives of the communities in which we operate; we undertake this effort alongside others, including efforts to strengthen Indigenous leadership across our business in Australia.\n\nThis year, the Remuneration Committee approved revisions to how we include climate change in the STIP. See pages 172-173 of the Remuneration Report for further detail.\n\nSince 2018, we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 1.1Mt CO 2 e, or 3%, which is on track with our 2030 target for absolute emissions. However, in 2020 our emissions remained at the same level as in 2019 at 31.5Mt CO 2 e. We expect progress on emissions to accelerate in the target period as we start to deliver our decarbonisation plans.\n\n## Forward plan\n\nOur ambition is to reach net zero emissions by 2050 across our operations. Our 2030 greenhouse gas targets are to reduce our emissions intensity by 30% and our absolute emissions by 15%, compared with our 2018 equity baseline. These targets are consistent with a 45% reduction in absolute emissions relative to 2010 levels and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nOur targets are supported by our commitment to spend approximately $1 billion on emissions reduction initiatives, research and development and activities to enhance the climate resilience of our business over the /first /five years of the ten-year target period.\n\n## Associated risks focus (see page 95):\n\n- -Strategic\n- -ESG\n\n## Associated risks focus (see page 95):\n\n- -Strategic\n- -ESG",

Against this backdrop, we generated underlying EBITDA of $23.9 billion equivalent to an underlying EBITDA margin of 51%.\n\nThis 13% increase on 2019 underlying EBITDA was principally driven by higher prices, which added around $3.4 billion in aggregate. Whilst our iron ore business bene/fited from robust demand and resilient prices, other commodities experienced signi/ficant volatility throughout the year. In aluminium, the impact of COVID-19 reduced prices sharply in the /first half of 2020, as demand shrunk, in particular from the automotive sector, but we saw these recover later in the year, on the back of strong demand from China and tight scrap markets. Copper initially followed the same path as aluminium, in line with the world economy, but has since recovered strongly. This was partly due to supply disruption and was ampli/fied by investor positioning.\n\nLower sales volumes and changes in product mix reduced underlying EBITDA by $0.5 billion. This was mainly driven by lower gold volumes following a reduction in grades at Oyu Tolgoi and at Kennecott, lower titanium dioxide feedstock volumes and lower sales of value-added products in our aluminium business in line with market demand.",

The pandemic-induced economic slowdown led to signi/ficantly lower energy costs, increasing underlying EBITDA by $0.5 billion, mainly from lower diesel prices for our trucks, trains and ships and reduced coal prices for two of our Paci/fic Aluminium smelters. We also bene/fited from continued respite on cost in/flation for certain raw materials for our aluminium business, in particular caustic soda, pitch, petroleum coke and alloys. However, this was outweighed by other cost pressures, notably the /fixed cost inef/ficiencies in our Copper business: at Kennecott, due to the extended smelter maintenance, and at Oyu Tolgoi in line with a temporary reduction in gold grades. Overall, our higher unit cash costs, excluding energy and general in/flation, reduced underlying EBITDA by $0.4 billion compared with 2019. In addition, we incurred $0.3 billion of costs associated with tackling COVID-19 across our operations.\n\n## No change to our disciplined capital allocation framework\n\nWhile we continue to adapt to an unpredictable external environment, one thing that does not change is our capital allocation framework. We will continue to invest in safely managing our assets and improving their performance. This means that suf/ficient spending on sustaining capital is always the priority. The next priority is allocating capital to our shareholders - through our ordinary dividend. Then we carefully consider; allocating to growth opportunities, balance sheet strength, and further shareholder returns.\n\nOur investment decisions are carried out with incredible rigour. I believe that this is the best assurance for our shareholders - that we will only invest in opportunities that create value - even more so during turbulent times. Growth for us is all about value generation and returns for our shareholders. It is not about volume. It is about building sustainable cash/uni00A0/flow.\n\nIn 2020, we increased our capital expenditure by 13% to $6.2/uni00A0billion, as we continue to invest through the cycle. This was comprised of $3.2/uni00A0billion of development capital, of which $2.1/uni00A0billion was replacement capital, and $3.0/uni00A0billion was sustaining capital. Our most signi/ficant growth project remains the Oyu Tolgoi copper/gold underground mine in Mongolia where we invested around $1 billion in 2020, on a 100% basis as we fully consolidate Oyu Tolgoi. Much of this year's increase relates to our Pilbara replacement iron ore mines as we ramped up the pace of construction at Gudai-Darri (formerly Koodaideri), at the Robe River Joint Venture mines and at Tom Price. We expect /first tonnes from these mines in 2021 and 2022.\n\n## Our strong balance sheet provides resilience\n\nWe ended 2020 with net debt of just $0.7 billion, a decrease of $3.0/uni00A0billion during the year due to the strength of our free cash /flow, net of the $6.3 billion of returns we paid to shareholders in 2020.\n\nOur world-class assets, combined with our very strong balance sheet, support our ability to provide superior cash returns to shareholders. They also enable us to manage the business through cycles - which means we can act counter-cyclically - and provide us with optionality. Our strong balance sheet is particularly valuable in the current volatile environment.\n\n## Our payout ratio has now averaged 73% over the past /five years\n\nWe implemented our returns policy in 2016, committing to total cash returns to shareholders, over the longer term, of 40-60% of underlying earnings, on average through the cycle. Since its inception, we have consistently paid out well above this range in every year.\n\nWe have built on our returns track record over /five years - this year, we are returning 72% of underlying earnings to shareholders. This is comprised of the full year ordinary dividend of 464 US cents per share and special dividend of 93 US cents per share, which brings the total dividend to 557 US cents, or $9.0 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Cunningham\n\nInterim Chief Financial Of/ficer\n\n22 February 2021",

The studies are expected to be complete by the end of 2021. If the investment is approved, construction would take approximately four years. The project could produce ~55 thousand tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate, 160 thousand tonnes of boric acid (B 2 O 3 units) and 255 thousand tonnes of sodium sulphate per year. 6\n- -At Resolution Copper, the independently prepared Final Environmental Impact Statement was published by the US Forest Service. We have now entered the next phase of public comment in the ongoing permitting process. We are committed to ongoing stakeholder engagement in our effort to seek consent to progress the project consistent with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining.\n- -At the Simandou iron ore project (Blocks 3 and 4) in Guinea, we expect to complete the /first phase of the technical optimisation work on the infrastructure components in the /first half of 2021. Activity at the mine area has commenced and an update of the Social and Environmental Impact Assessment is underway.\n- -The $2.6 billion Gudai-Darri (formerly known as Koodaideri) replacement iron ore mine in Western Australia is progressing, with production ramp-up on track for early 2022. This /first phase of Gudai-Darri will have a 43 Mt annual capacity, underpinning production of the Pilbara Blend\u2122.\n- -First ore from the other iron ore sustaining production projects - the $0.8 billion (our share) Robe River Joint Venture (West Angelas C&D and Mesa B, C and H at Robe Valley) and the $0.8 billion Western Turner Syncline phase 2 mine - is on track for 2021.\n- -At the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper/gold project in Mongolia, we con/firmed development capital of $6.75 billion 7 following completion of the de/finitive estimate, with sustainable production for Panel 0 expected to commence in October 2022. We are in active discussions with the government of Mongolia to address and close all outstanding issues and increase the project's bene/fits to all stakeholders.\n- -The $0.9 billion /first phase of the south wall pushback at the Kennecott copper mine in the US, which will extend mine life to 2026, remains on track with gradually higher copper grades accessed from 2021. Stripping for the $1.5 billion second phase is also on track and is expected to extend operations for a further six years.\n- -The Zulti South project at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa, which will sustain current capacity and extend mine life, remains on full suspension, pending normalisation of operations.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings by product group\n\n|                                                           | Underlying EBITDA   | Underlying EBITDA   |          | Underlying earnings   | Underlying earnings   |          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Year ended 31 December                                    | 2020  US$m          | 2019 US$m           | Change % | 2020 US$m             | 2019 US$m             | Change % |\n| Iron Ore                                                  | 18,837              | 16,098              | 17%      | 11,398                | 9,638                 | 18%      |\n| Aluminium                                                 | 2,152               | 2,285               | (6)%     | 471                   | 599                   | (21)%    |\n| Copper & Diamonds                                         | 2,172               | 2,073               | 5%       | 763                   | 554                   | 38%      |\n| Energy & Minerals                                         | 1,646               | 1,762               | (7)%     | 577                   | 611                   | (6)%     |\n| Reportable segment total                                  | 24,807              | 22,218              | 12%      | 13,209                | 11,402                | 16%      |\n| Other operations                                          | -                   | (77)                | (100)%   | (54)                  | (89)                  | (39)%    |\n| Inter-segment transactions                                | (94)                | (9)                 | 944%     | (32)                  | (3)                   | 967%     |\n| Product group total                                       | 24,713              | 22,132              | 12%      | 13,123                | 11,310                | 16%      |\n| Central pension costs, share-based payments and insurance | 72                  | 59                  | 22%      | 81                    | 60                    | 35%      |\n| Restructuring, project and one-off costs                  | (133)               | (183)               | (27)%    | (108)                 | (94)                  | 15%      |\n| Other central costs                                       | (500)               | (496)               | 1%       | (418)                 | (550)                 | (24)%    |\n| Central exploration and evaluation                        | (250)               | (315)               | (21)%    | (216)                 | (231)                 | (6)%     |\n| Net interest                                              |                     |                     |          | (14)                  | (122)                 | (89)%    |\n| Total                                                     | 23,902              | 21,197              | 13%      | 12,448                | 10,373                | 20%      |\n\nUnderlying EBITDA and underlying earnings are non-GAAP alternative performance measures ('APMs') used by management to assess the performance of the business, and provide additional information which investors may /find useful.

The principal factors explaining the movements in underlying EBITDA are set out in this table.\n\n|                           | US$m   |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| 2019 underlying EBITDA    | 21,197 |\n| Prices                    | 3,407  |\n| Exchange rates            | (103)  |\n| Volumes and mix           | (452)  |\n| General in/flation        | (251)  |\n| Energy                    | 461    |\n| Operating cash unit costs | (450)  |\n| One-off items             | 153    |\n| Non-cash costs/other      | (60)   |\n| 2020 underlying EBITDA    | 23,902 |\n\n## Signi/ficant momentum from higher iron ore prices\n\nCommodity price movements in 2020 increased underlying EBITDA by $3,407 million compared with 2019. This was primarily driven by the strength in pricing for iron ore (+$3,262 million) and copper (+$405/uni00A0million) and was partly offset by lower prices for aluminium, alumina and bauxite (-$314 million)./uni00A0We have included a table of prices and exchange rates on page 381.\n\nThe 2020 monthly average Platts index for 62% iron /fines adjusted to an FOB basis was 19% higher on average compared with 2019, driven by continued supply disruptions in the seaborne market and strong demand following record Chinese steel output.\n\nThe average London Metal Exchange (LME) price for copper was 3% higher, while the LME aluminium price was 5%/uni00A0lower, compared with 2019. The gold price rose 27%./uni00A0\n\nThe midwest premium for aluminium in the US averaged $313 per tonne, 2% lower than in 2019.\n\n## Exchange rates impacted by stronger A$ at year-end\n\nCompared with 2019, on average, the US dollar was broadly /flat against the Australian and Canadian dollars but strengthened by 12%/uni00A0against the South African rand. Currency movements, which lowered underlying EBITDA by $103 million relative to 2019, mainly related to exchange rate losses on receivables following the signi/ficant strengthening of the Australian dollar at 2020 year-end./uni00A0\n\n## Volumes and product mix\n\nUnderlying EBITDA was $452 million/uni00A0lower than 2019 from movements in sales volumes and changes in product mix across the portfolio. Although iron ore shipments from the Pilbara rose by 1%, the year-on-year gains are mostly included in Other, re/flecting recovery from the /fire at Cape Lambert A port in 2019. Other key variances included lower gold volumes following a reduction in grades at Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott, lower titanium dioxide feedstock volumes and lower sales of value added products in our aluminium business in line with market demand.\n\n## Energy prices substantially lower\n\nAverage movements in energy prices compared with 2019 improved underlying EBITDA by $461 million, mainly due to lower diesel prices and reduced coal prices for two of our Paci/fic Aluminium smelters.\n\n## Higher costs driven by lower volumes\n\nThe impact of higher cash operating costs, which we re/flect on a unit cost basis, reduced underlying EBITDA by $450 million compared with 2019. There was continued respite on cost in/flation for certain raw materials for Aluminium, in particular caustic soda, pitch, petroleum coke and alloys. However, this was outweighed by other cost pressures, notably /fixed cost inef/ficiencies at Kennecott, due to the lower grades and the extended smelter maintenance, and higher unit cash costs at Oyu Tolgoi in line with lower output.\n\n## Maintained our exploration spend\n\nOur exploration and evaluation spend was largely unchanged at $625 million. This went to our green/field programmes and highest value projects, particularly on evaluating the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, advancing our Winu copper/gold deposit in Australia and progressing our Jadar lithium-borate project in Serbia. In addition, $82 million for iron ore feasibility studies in the Pilbara/uni00A0was recognised as capital expenditure./uni00A0\n\n## One-off items\n\nOne-off items aggregated to be $153 million less than in 2019. 2020 one-offs primarily re/flected earlier than planned pot-lining replacement at the Kitimat aluminium smelter ($51 million) and an increased impact from curtailment of operations at RBM ($23 million). These were offset by the non-recurrence of 2019 events,/uni00A0including the $199 million charge at Escondida to re/flect cancellation of existing coal powered energy contracts following a switch to renewables and $68 million for challenges faced at our ISAL and Kitimat aluminium smelters./uni00A0\n\n## Non-cash costs/other\n\nMovements in non-cash costs and other items, which lowered underlying EBITDA by $60 million compared with 2019, mainly re/flected additional costs ($333 million) incurred from COVID-19 across the Group such as screening, equipment hire, roster changes, temporary relocation and hygiene. This was offset by recovery from the /fire at the Cape Lambert A port in the Pilbara in 2019 ($184 million) and lower provisions in respect of legacy operations ($23 million).",

The effective tax rate on underlying earnings in Australia was 32% in 2020 compared with 31% in 2019. We anticipate an effective tax rate on underlying earnings of approximately 30% in 2021.\n\n## Items excluded from underlying earnings\n\nNet impairment charges decreased by $543 million compared with 2019. We recognised $1,115 million/uni00A0of impairment charges in 2020, comprised of $472 million related to three of our Paci/fic Aluminium smelters (NZAS, Bell Bay and Boyne), $131 million related to the/uni00A0ISAL/uni00A0smelter in Iceland, $220 million/uni00A0for the Sohar smelter in Oman and $292 million related to our interest in the Diavik diamond mine.\n\nIn 2019, we recognised impairment charges of $1,658 million, after tax and non-controlling interests, primarily related to the Oyu Tolgoi copper/ gold underground project and the Yarwun alumina re/finery. There is a detailed explanation of the impairment process on pages 229-231.\n\nThe $291 million movement in losses on consolidation and disposals of interests in businesses primarily relates to the disposal of our stake in R\u00f6ssing Uranium in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we recognised non-cash exchange and derivative losses of $1,264 million. This was mainly on US dollar debt in non-US dollar functional currency Group companies, intragroup balances, and on the revaluation of certain derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting. These losses compared with a 2019 loss of $200 million, giving rise to a negative year-on-year movement of $1,064 million. The/uni00A0exchange losses are largely offset by currency translation gains recognised in equity. The quantum of US dollar debt is largely unaffected and we will repay it from US dollar sales receipts./uni00A0\n\nIn 2020, we excluded net additional closure costs of $300 million/uni00A0from underlying earnings principally relating to a non-operating site (Gove), a/uni00A0fully impaired site (Argyle) and the net earnings impact in respect of increases to closure provisions following a reduction to the closure discount rate. These are included in Movements in other exclusions. Further analysis can be found on page 226.\n\n## Pro/fit\n\nNet earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net pro/fit attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto in 2020 was $9.8 billion (2019: $8.0 billion). We recorded a pro/fit after tax in 2020 of $10.4 billion (2019: $7.0 billion) of which a pro/fit of $0.6 billion (2019 loss: $1.0 billion) was attributable to non-controlling interests.",

At 31 December 2020, approximately 86% of these liabilities were at /floating interest rates (94% excluding leases). The maximum amount within non-current borrowings maturing in any one calendar year was $1.8 billion, which matures in 2025.\n\nWe had/uni00A0$12.9/uni00A0billion/uni00A0in cash and cash equivalents plus other short-term cash investments at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $10.6 billion) and we have $7.5 billion of fully committed Revolving Credit Facilities, which remained undrawn throughout the period, and mature in November 2023.\n\n## Provision for closure costs\n\nThis year we have enhanced our disclosure on Provisions for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations, which at 31 December 2020, were $13.3/uni00A0billion (31 December 2019: $11.1/uni00A0billion). The principal movements during the year were currency appreciation ($0.7/uni00A0billion), reduction in discount rate ($1.0 billion), changes to existing and new provisions ($0.6 billion) and drawdowns in the provision through spend ($0.4/uni00A0billion). Of the $13.3/uni00A0billion in provisions, $10.7/uni00A0billion relates to operating sites and $2.6/uni00A0billion is for legacy sites. Remaining lives of operations and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average for all sites, weighted by present closure obligation, of around 17/uni00A0years (2019: 18 years).\n\nThe provisions are based on risk-adjusted cash /flows. In September 2020, we completed a review of the discount rate used to re/flect the obligations at present value and updated it to a real-rate of 1.5% (previously 2.0%), applied prospectively from that date.\n\nIn 2021, we expect to utilise around $0.6 billion of the provisions as we advance our closure activities at Argyle, Energy Resources of Australia, Gove alumina re/finery and legacy sites.\n\nWe have disclosed further information, including the composition of the provision by cost category and by geography, on pages 244-245.",

In December 2020, we con/firmed the de/finitive estimate of cost and schedule for Panel 0 with sustainable production expected to commence in October 2022 and development capital of $6.75 billion 1 , in line with the ranges /first announced in July 2019. These estimates include the known impacts of COVID-19 2 . Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 480,000 tonnes 3 of copper per year on average, from 2028-36, from the open pit and underground.\n\nWe consider that additional milestones need to be met in order to ensure that the project can commence caving operations in 2021: outstanding government approvals - including registering the updated Resources and Reserves submitted in February 2020 and accepting the updated feasibility study completed in July 2020 in accordance with the 2009 Investment Agreement and Mongolian regulation; funding as agreed with Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ) in a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2020; and achieving the power milestones agreed with the Government of Mongolia in June 2020. We continue to work closely with our partners, the government of Mongolia and TRQ, in the coming months to /finalise these milestones, as outlined in our 16 December announcement.\n\nOn 22 December, Oyu Tolgoi received a tax assessment for approximately $228 million from the Mongolian Tax Authority, relating to an audit of taxes paid between 2016 and 2018. This assessment is in addition to $752 million of taxes and royalties paid in the same period. Oyu Tolgoi's application to include these matters in the pending international arbitration related to 2013 to 2015 has been accepted.\n\nOn 4 January 2021, the government of Mongolia advised Rio Tinto that they were dissatis/fied with the results of the de/finitive estimate and the funding implications for the sharing of economic bene/fits between the shareholders of Oyu Tolgoi. We are engaging with the government of Mongolia in relation to the de/finitive estimate.\n\nWe are in active discussions with the government of Mongolia to address and close all outstanding issues and increase the project's bene/fits to all stakeholders.\n\n- 1. This estimate is at a 'better than feasibility study' level of accuracy.\n- 2. The de/finitive estimate assumes restrictions in 2021 that are no more stringent than those experienced in September 2020. Mongolia implemented further restrictions at the end of 2020 in response to a re-emergence of COVID-19. Should COVID-19 constraints be maintained at December 2020 levels, escalate further in 2021 leading to tougher restrictions, or continue beyond 2021, additional costs and schedule impacts will arise.\n- 3. This production target (stated as recovered metal) for the Oyu Tolgoi underground and open pit mines was previously reported in a release to the market on 16 December 2020 (market release).

We acknowledge the signi/ficance of these connections, which have endured over centuries. We strive to build constructive relationships with each Tribe based on mutual respect, meaningful engagement, trust, mutual understanding and mutual bene/fit. We will continue to listen to the perspectives and concerns of each Tribe throughout the life of the project.\n\nOver the last two decades, archaeological reports, ethnographic and ethnohistoric studies and tribal perspective reports have been produced in partnership with Tribes and the US Forest Service to identify places, areas, artefacts and natural features of importance. We have also produced more than 150 cultural baseline reports, incorporating all elements of the landscape and conducted with tribal members trained under the Tribal Monitoring Program. The Tribal Monitoring Program is a /first-of-its-kind program for the US Forest Service, employing more than 30 members from seven consulting Tribes working alongside archeologists.\n\nIn January 2021, the US Forest Service published the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Resolution Copper. The publication re/flects a delay from the July 2020 target date, set by the Obama Administration, and comes after more than seven years of public and 11 years of tribal consultation. Resolution Copper has not applied or taken advantage of programmes to expedite or 'fast-track' the permitting process.\n\nThere are multiple moments in the formulation of a project and during its operation in which innovation and adjustments are possible. Opportunities to reduce impacts, where possible, will be an objective of future studies. We are committed to ongoing stakeholder engagement in our effort to seek consent to progress the project, consistent with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining.\n\n## Gudai-Darri: Western Australia, Iron Ore\n\nAt Gudai-Darri (formerly Koodaideri), set to be our most technologically advanced mine, construction is progressing on track with the expected production ramp-up in early 2022.\n\nThis year, we announced the opening of a new airport, which is expected to handle more than 600 workers a day at peak operating times. The airport will help strengthen site safety by minimising mine employees' exposure to driving and vehicle transport while also reducing the hours they are required to travel from an alternate airport, reducing fatigue. The airport will also provide a safer landing option for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, our longstanding partner.\n\nWe built Western Australia's largest steel beam bridge to carry Great Northern Highway traf/fic over Gudai-Darri's train line. Rail formation works are on target and track-laying also began in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nWe completed the studies for the 34MW solar plant at Gudai-Darri and commence construction in 2021. This will consist of about 100,000 solar panels made up of photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity. On average, the solar plant is expected to supply all of Gudai-Darri's electricity demand during peak solar power generation times and approximately 65% of the mine's\n\naverage electricity demand. With a new lithium-ion battery energy storage system, the solar plant could reduce our annual carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 90,000 tonnes compared to conventional gas-powered generation. This is the equivalent of taking about 28,000 cars off the road.\n\nImportantly, growth at Gudai-Darri progresses with the community in mind: to date, the project has awarded local businesses - including Pilbara, Pilbara Aboriginal and Western Australia-based businesses - contracts valued at more than A$1.1 billion, supporting approximately 2,000 jobs in the construction phase.\n\n## Simandou: Guinea, Iron Ore\n\nSimandou contains one of the world's largest and richest high-grade iron ore deposits, demand for which is increasing as steelmakers look to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nSimandou broadens our global portfolio of iron ore products and complements the long-term attractiveness of our Pilbara Blend\u2122. We remain committed to Simandou and to delivering its bene/fits to our partners as well as to local communities and the people of Guinea.\n\nIn 2020, work continued on the technical optimisation of the Simandou project with the support of China-based institutions and business partners, as well as preparatory work and activities related to the project's Social and Environmental Impact Assessment. Engagement continued with the government of Guinea about potential mechanisms for collaboration on infrastructure development.\n\n## Winu: Western Australia, Copper\n\nAt our Winu project in Western Australia, we are actively engaging with Traditional Owners through on-Country heritage surveys, monitoring and agreement making, which is expected to continue into 2021, with /first ore expected in 2024, subject to regulatory approvals, Traditional Owner and other consents and COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nDrilling results at Ngapakarra, about two kilometres east of Winu, provide further encouragement about the potential to develop multiple orebodies in the district. We have explored only a small percentage of our tenements in the Paterson region of Western Australia so far, which includes both our 100% owned tenements and joint ventures.\n\n## Jadar: Serbia, Lithium\n\nThis year, we approved an additional investment of almost $200 million to continue to progress the lithium-borate Jadar project. The investment will fund the feasibility study and associated engineering, as well as permitting and land acquisition by the end of 2021, in line with the initial project schedule.\n\nThe Jadar deposit contains high-grade mineralisation of boron and lithium (Jadarite) and has the potential to produce both battery-grade lithium carbonate and boric acid. The deposit is located on the doorstep of the European Union, one of the fastest growing electric vehicle markets in the world. Jadarite was discovered in 2004 by Rio Tinto geologists near the city of Loznica, Serbia.\n\nFor further information on litigation and investigations related to Simandou and other matters, please refer to the 'Contingent Liabilities' note on page 261 for further information.",

We are one of the world's leading producers of iron ore.\n\nOur Iron Ore product group includes Dampier Salt, also in Western Australia - the world's largest exporter of seaborne salt. Our fully integrated portfolio of quality assets, highly valued product suite and committed people and partners are key pillars of our value over volume strategy.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is de/fined as underlying earnings excluding net interest divided by average capital employed (operating assets).\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2020, our Iron Ore operations continued to improve our safety culture as evidenced by the strong performance. We marked more than two years without a fatality and achieved a step change in safety performance with the injury rate and severity rate decreasing by 20% and 13%, respectively. The number of potentially fatal incidents continued to decline - approximately 29% lower, year on year.\n\nWe continue to remove or reduce our material risk exposure to eliminate fatalities at our operations. We have detailed improvement plans built against our safety maturity model. These focus on being a learning organisation, our leadership and engagement approach, risk/uni00A0management and our work planning. The delivery of these plans will support a sustained improvement towards our goal of zero harm.\n\nDuring 2020, we responded to COVID-19 with a clear, nimble strategy, using our hierarchy of controls to manage the risks associated with the virus and keep people safe.\n\nWe took extensive measures to reduce virus transmission pathways, including travel restrictions, self-isolation, quarantine and physical distancing. We changed our rosters to minimise movement across operations and implemented additional cleaning and sanitisation. Rapid screening clinics were introduced at Perth and regional airports and our regional towns to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nTogether, our employees and contractors, partners and host communities demonstrated commitment, resilience, innovation and collaboration in helping us to keep our operations strong and safe. Despite the pandemic we improved our overall safety performance.\n\nIn 2020, we also conducted a safety culture diagnostic to further mature our safety culture, with a focus on mindsets and behaviours through a leadership lens. Insights from the diagnostic and other assessments, combined with lessons from incidents, will continue to drive a targeted, problem-solving-based approach to ensure the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOur strong operational performance in the Pilbara in 2020 enabled us to take advantage of the rising price environment for our high-quality products. This price strength was driven by buoyant demand from China and constraints in global seaborne supply./uni00A0We increased our iron ore shipments by 1% and production by 2% compared with 2019, whilst implementing strict measures to manage COVID-19.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $18.8 billion was 17% higher than 2019, primarily re/flective of higher prices, partially offset by rising unit costs. The monthly average Platts index for 62% iron /fines adjusted to an FOB basis was 19% higher than 2019. Higher realised prices increased underlying EBITDA by $3.2 billion, while a stronger Australian dollar reduced underlying EBITDA by $0.3 billion.\n\n2020 Pilbara unit cash costs, which were $15.4/uni00A0per tonne (2019: $14.4 per tonne), include $0.6 per tonne of COVID-19 costs, which relate to the controls we have put in place to keep our people safe such as additional cleaning and /flights, screening and roster changes. We experienced a higher/uni00A0monthly volatility in the iron ore price and an appreciation in the Australian dollar at year end. This triggered exchange and related effects, including losses on receivables, which added a net/uni00A0$0.4 per tonne to unit cash costs in 2020. A signi/ficant majority of our Pilbara operating costs (excluding freight and royalties) are denominated in Australian dollars. We also experienced a higher mining work effort from longer haul distances, below water table mining and increased maintenance activity which we offset through productivity gains from increased automation and lower fuel prices. Overall, underlying unit cash costs were stable year on year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 costs.\n\nWe have continued investing in productivity and automation and are now seeing an improved effectiveness of our integrated system: around 60% of our truck /fleet in the Pilbara is now fully autonomous. We have a pathway that will see around/uni00A0two thirds of the /fleet being automated by the end of 2021.\n\nOur Pilbara operations delivered an underlying FOB EBITDA margin of 74%, compared with 72% in 2019.",

        "page_content": "We price the majority of our iron ore sales (77%) by reference to the average index price for the month of shipment. In 2020, we priced approximately 13% of sales by reference to the prior quarter's average index lagged by one month with the remainder sold either on current quarter average, current month average or on the spot market. We made approximately 70% of sales including freight and 30% on an FOB basis.\n\nWe achieved an average iron ore price of/uni00A0$91.0 per wet metric tonne on an FOB basis (2019: $79.0 per wet metric tonne) across our product suite. This equates to $98.9 per dry metric tonne, assuming 8% moisture (2019: $85.9 per dry metric tonne), which compares with the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron /fines converted to an FOB basis of $101.3 per dry metric tonne (2019: $84.9 per dry metric tonne). The slightly lower realised price compared to the Platts index was due to lower market premiums for lump and the effect of the sales priced by reference to the prior quarter's average index lagged by one month in a rising price environment throughout 2020.\n\nGross product sales for our Pilbara operations included freight revenue of $1.5 billion (2019: $1.7 billion).\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of/uni00A0$13.2 billion was 16% higher than 2019, in line with the increase in underlying EBITDA.\n\nThe $10.2 billion of free cash /flow was 7% higher than 2019, re/flecting a 69% increase in capital spend, mainly related to the ramp-up of construction activity at the new Gudai-Darri hub.\n\n## Review of operations/uni00A0\n\nWe achieved a strong operating performance across the network in 2020, managing the challenges of weather disruptions and the implementation of strict measures to manage COVID-19. Our Pilbara operations produced 333.4 million tonnes (our share 275.5 million tonnes), 2% higher than 2019, underpinned by record total material moved for the year, 7% higher than the previous record set in 2019, highlighting the improvements to mine and asset health.\n\n2020 shipments of 330.6 million tonnes (our share 273.1 million tonnes), which were 1% higher than 2019, were impacted by Cyclone Damien in the /first quarter and by COVID-19, which also resulted in the deferral of maintenance at the port to the third quarter. We continue to ramp up our port sales in China, with 5.5 million tonnes of sales in 2020. Our portside operation handles product from our operations in the Pilbara and in Canada, as well as third-party product, and provides blending and screening capabilities.\n\nFollowing the events at Juukan Gorge, we continue to reassess all activities which have the potential to impact heritage sites. We will continue to review mine plans to ensure the protection of sites of exceptional cultural value and have increased monitoring of operating activities that have the potential to impact heritage sites. We have also integrated heritage management into our mining operations - our Iron Ore business now has primary responsibility for our Communities and Social Performance partnerships and engagement.\n\n## Pilbara shipments\n\n(million tonnes - 100% basis)\n\n|   2016 | 327.6 327.6   |\n|--------|---------------|\n|   2017 | 330.1         |\n|   2018 | 338.2 338.2   |\n|   2019 | 327.4 327.4   |\n|   2020 | 330.6         |\n\n## New projects and growth options/uni00A0\n\nWe are progressing our $2.6 billion Gudai-Darri iron ore mine, with key construction activities on schedule. This new production hub will be our most technologically advanced, incorporating a processing plant and infrastructure including an airport, camp and a 166-kilometre rail line connecting the mine to our existing network. We continue to anticipate production to ramp up in early 2022. Once fully commissioned, the initial mine development will have an annual capacity of 43 million tonnes./uni00A0This will increase the lump to /fines ratio in our Pilbara Blend shipments to 38%.\n\nWe have multiple project scopes under study for Gudai-Darri Phase 2, following Board approval for a $44 million pre-feasibility study. Ultimately, the capacity of the hub could be up to 70 million tonnes per year, depending on market conditions.\n\nWe are also investing $1.55 billion with our joint venture partners, Mitsui and Nippon Steel, (our 53% share is $820 million) at the Robe Valley and West Angelas operations. We have received all required approvals, and procurement and construction activities are progressing well. We anticipate /first ore from these projects in 2021.\n\nOur $749 million investment in the Western Turner Syncline phase 2 mine, part of Greater Tom Price operations, will facilitate mining of new deposits and includes construction of a new crusher and a 13-kilometre conveyor. First ore is expected in 2021.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2020, Iron Ore's absolute greenhouse gas emissions were 3Mt CO 2 -e (on an equity basis), an increase of 0.3Mt CO 2 -e compared to the 2018 emissions baseline, driven by an increase in diesel emissions due to increased haul distances and material movement.\n\nIn the short to medium term, abatement opportunities relate to the deployment of renewable power projects. A range of renewable energy studies are underway to support a transition from using natural gas to power our operations, while longer-term works natural transitioning the mobile mining /fleet from diesel to alternative energies. The transition from traditional fuels in mining will require technical and economic developments in renewable energy, alternative fuels and energy transfer/uni00A0systems.\n\nConstruction of the company's /first 34 MW solar PV plant at the Gudai-Darri mine is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2021. In addition, we expect to commission a 12MW/h battery energy storage system to strengthen the security and reliability of our Pilbara power network. The solar plant and battery systems are estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 90,000 tonnes per year.\n\nRio Tinto also committed $10 million over the next two years with the world's largest steel producer, China Baowu Steel Group, to support low-carbon steelmaking projects and research. This investment is the next step in advancing our partnership with China Baowu and Tsinghua University, announced in 2019, and will fund the establishment of a Low Carbon Raw Materials Preparation R&D Centre, which will initially prioritise the development of lower carbon ore preparation processes. Rio Tinto/uni00A0also strengthened our partnership with Tsinghua University, committing a further $4.5 million over the next /five years to support research projects at the Tsinghua-Rio Tinto Joint Research Centre for Resources, Energy and Sustainable Development. We also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Nippon Steel Corporation, Japan's largest steel producer, to jointly explore, develop and demonstrate technologies to transition to a low-carbon emissions steel value chain.",

Managing the process from start to /finish allows us to deliver high-quality products to our customers, reliably and ef/ficiently: from high-grade bauxite for the global seaborne trade to sustainably sourced aluminium for beverage packaging to new, lighter alloys for the automotive industry.\n\nOur Canadian operations average in the /first decile of the industry cost-curve and produce primary metal using clean, renewable hydropower. In 2018, we became the /first company to offer aluminium certi/fied as responsible by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), meaning it meets the highest environmental, social and governance standards.\n\nIn 2020, we announced a global partnership with AB InBev, the world's largest beer brewer. Initially focused on North America, the partnership will see us provide low-carbon aluminium for AB InBev's beer cans.\n\nWe also announced an investment in a new remelt furnace at our Laterri\u00e8re casting centre, and a partnership with Shawinigan Aluminium Inc., both in Canada, to offer our US and Canadian customers high-quality alloys made with recycled scrap, starting in 2021.\n\n## Snapshot of the year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aluminium in /figures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nbauxite mines in Australia, Brazil and Guinea\n\n## 3\n\nresearch and development centres in Canada, France and Australia\n\n## $9.3bn\n\ngross product sales\n\n(2019: $10.3bn)\n\n4\n\nalumina re/fineries in Australia, Brazil and Canada\n\n## 22\n\nsites certi/fied responsible by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI)\n\nELYSIS - our partnership with Alcoa, supported by Apple and the governments of Canada and Quebec - completed its Research & Development Centre in the Saguenay, in Quebec, Canada, where it will continue to develop smelting technology free of direct carbon emissions.\n\nIn 2021, we launched StaRT\u2122, the /first sustainability label for aluminium, which will be delivered to customers using blockchain technology.

In 2020, we completed over 257,000 veri/fications on critical controls including more than 40,000 veri/fications speci/fic to COVID-19. We also progressed a programme to reduce vehicle-pedestrian risks, including the implementation of a pedestrian proximity detection system in our/uni00A0smelters.\n\nWe further enhanced our management of major hazards by improving the way we report and learn from process safety incidents. We also strengthened governance of critical controls across process safety, tailings and water dams.\n\nWe are progressing our /five-year plan to reduce health risk exposures by improving monitoring and implementing engineering controls, such as ventilation.\n\nDuring the year, we increased our focus on mental health and raised awareness of our employee assistance programme to better support our employees and their families during COVID-19, and supported local communities in their implementation of COVID-19 safety measures.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOur aluminium business was resilient in 2020, despite signi/ficantly lower sales prices and reduced demand for value-added product (VAP), driven by market conditions from the impact of COVID-19. Markets were particularly challenging for aluminium metal where global demand for primary aluminium declined by approximately 3% and global supply was largely unchanged. However, our focus on operational stability, resilience through COVID-19 and cash /flow generation, enabled us to deliver solid underlying EBITDA and strong cash /flows.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $2.2 billion declined by just $0.1 billion, 6% lower than 2019, despite the weaker pricing environment, which impacted underlying EBITDA by $0.3/uni00A0billion. We were able to offset most of the pricing impact through operational improvements and productivity gains, along with lower prices for our inputs, which totalled $0.3 billion. These included raw material ef/ficiencies, reduced energy costs and lower input prices, primarily for caustic soda and petroleum coke. This enabled us to maintain our industry-leading/uni00A0underlying EBITDA margin at 26%, in line with 2019.\n\nWe achieved an average realised aluminium price of $1,946 per tonne, 9% lower than 2019 ($2,132 per tonne). This comprised the LME price, a market premium and a product (VAP) premium. The cash LME price averaged $1,702 per tonne, 5% lower than 2019, even after a sharp recovery in the second half of 2020. In our key US market, the midwest premium dropped 2% to $313 per tonne on average in 2020. VAP represented 43% of the primary metal we sold, in line with market demand (2019: 51%), and generated product premiums averaging $213 per tonne of VAP sold (2019: $234 per tonne). Market demand for VAP rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2020, returning to normal levels.\n\nAlthough we are broadly balanced in alumina, approximately 2.2 million tonnes of our legacy alumina sales contracts are exposed to a /fixed linkage to the LME price. These contracts date back to 2005 or earlier, and the majority expire between 2023 and 2030. In 2020, the opportunity loss was $0.1 billion, compared with $0.2 billion in 2019.\n\nDespite the signi/ficantly weaker market environment, we generated $1.9 billion in net cash from operating activities with free cash /flow increasing by/uni00A09% to $0.9 billion. This was underpinned by productivity improvements, lower costs, reductions in working capital in the year and lower capital expenditure.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nBauxite production of 56.1 million tonnes was 2% higher than 2019 supported by the ramp-up of the expansion at the CBG mine in Guinea, and steady performance at the Paci/fic mines, including additional volumes from the start-up of the Amrun mine in 2019.\n\nWe shipped 39.4 million tonnes of bauxite to third parties, 1% lower than in 2019. Shipments were prioritised throughout the year to align with customer needs, with a higher proportion of internal shipments to our Paci/fic re/fineries.",

This extension of operations provides certainty to employees, the local community and customers while providing more time for all stakeholders to plan for the future.\n\nOn 15 February 2021, we reached agreement on an amended power contract with the energy supplier, Landsvirkjun, that will allow the ISAL aluminium smelter in Iceland to continue operating with an improved competitive position. We have withdrawn our complaint /filed with the Icelandic Competition Authority.\n\n## New projects and growth options\n\nAt the Kemano project in Kitimat, British Columbia, we are constructing a second tunnel to de-risk our 100% owned hydropower facility. The project was originally approved in 2017, with $155 million of additional capital approved in 2020, bringing the total to $630 million. It was impacted by the departure of the main contractor in the /first half of 2020. Tunnel excavation works restarted in September. However, due to the escalation of COVID-19 in the province, tunnel excavation works have been interrupted. We expect to restart late in the /first quarter of 2021.\n\nELYSIS, our joint venture with Alcoa, supported by Apple and the governments of Canada and Quebec, is developing a breakthrough technology that eliminates all direct greenhouse gases from the traditional aluminium smelting process.

This new centre will produce metal at a similar scale to smaller, industrial-sized smelting cells that are in operation by some producers today. Commissioning of the Industrial R&D Centre is underway.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2020, our Aluminium product group's absolute greenhouse gas emissions (21.8 MtCO 2 e) were 1.3% lower than the 2018 equity baseline (22.1 MtCO 2 e). Contributions to this improvement included smelting process changes and the increased use of hydroelectric boilers in re/fining. These improvements were delivered while increasing bauxite production by 12%, maintaining alumina production and reducing production slightly across the smelting portfolio compared to the 2018 baseline.\n\nThe 2020 emissions intensity of our managed Atlantic Operations smelters, powered by hydroelectricity, was 2.13 tCO 2 eq per tonne of aluminium - less than one-/fifth of the industry average - while our Vaudreuil alumina re/finery has the lowest carbon footprint in the world/uni00A0today.",

However, we did have a permanent disabling injury at the Diavik Diamond Mine, in Canada. We recorded an all-injury frequency rate of 0.30, which is a leading safety/uni00A0performance.\n\nThis year, we also continued our focus on supporting the health and wellbeing of our employees, driving stronger risk and incident management, and sustaining improvements in safety. We recorded and shared nearly 300 improvement initiatives between our assets.\n\nOur overall approach to the COVID-19 pandemic has been centred on protecting our employees and contractors from the virus, supporting mental wellbeing, and working together with local communities. The response measures implemented at each of our operations were based on risks speci/fic to the asset and its employees, ensuring alignment with guidance from the relevant authorities at local and national levels.\n\nOur Diavik Diamond Mine was the /first operation within Rio Tinto to set up an on-site COVID-19 testing facility. Our Kennecott operation is conducting an average of 8,000 tests per month. Both contribute to the approximately 40,000 tests completed across our Copper & Diamonds operations in 2020. In addition to ensuring preparedness to various COVID-19 scenarios, we have taken a wide range of preventative measures, including rapid screening for employees and contractors, improved hygiene processes at sites and in of/fices, and adjusted roster arrangements, which has mitigated risks for our employees, contractors and communities.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn 2020, we increased/uni00A0underlying EBITDA despite lower revenues amidst a challenging year. It was a year of transition for our operational mine plans at Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi, with a temporary reduction in copper and gold grades. Weak market conditions in the /first half, COVID-19 restrictions and a 5.7 magnitude earthquake in Utah in March, were the principal external challenges. In addition, we incurred a delay in restarting the Kennecott smelter, following a planned shutdown.\n\nA strong recovery in the copper price and fully operational Kennecott smelter by October, coupled with strong actions to address the headwinds, namely tight cost control and acceleration of access to higher gold grades at Oyu Tolgoi, led to a 5% increase in underlying EBITDA to $2.2 billion, with margins rising to 47%.\n\nPrice movements for all products bene/fited/uni00A0underlying EBITDA by $0.5 billion for the full year. Our average realised copper price increased by 3% to 283 US cents per pound. Other prices were mixed, with gold rising 27% to $1,770 per ounce while our realised diamond prices declined by/uni00A021% on a weighted average basis. An unplanned /flash converting furnace rebuild at Kennecott following the earthquake and delays in restarting the smelter following planned major maintenance after the\n\nshutdown also impacted/uni00A0underlying EBITDA through reduced volumes, leading to /fixed cost inef/ficiencies. This was partially offset by 82% higher molybdenum concentrate volumes at Kennecott, where we also realised some exports of copper concentrate into a strengthening market.\n\nOur copper unit costs, at 111 cents per pound in 2020, were 20% higher than in 2019, due to lower copper grades at Kennecott and Escondida and delays in restarting the Kennecott smelter, driving lower volumes. This was partly offset by cost reduction programmes and higher by-product credits, with higher prices for gold and higher molybdenum volumes, due to improved grades, albeit at lower prices.\n\nWe continued to advance our future copper evaluation projects, in particular at Resolution Copper in Arizona and at Winu in Western Australia.\n\nWe generated $1.1 billion in cash from our operating activities, a 29% decline on 2019, primarily driven by anticipated lower copper and gold grades, combined with the operational challenges at Kennecott. We also received $0.1 billion lower dividends from our 30% equity holding in Escondida. Free cash /flow was an out/flow of $0.6 billion re/flecting the lower operating cash /flow and a sustained level of capital investment ($1.7 billion), mainly relating to the ongoing development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground project, where we have a 34% effective interest but fully consolidate on the basis of management control.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nMined copper, at 527.9/uni00A0thousand tonnes, was 9% lower than 2019, primarily due to lower grades at Kennecott, as a result of planned pit sequencing, and lower grades and lower material moved at Escondida.\n\n## Kennecott\n\nMined copper production at Kennecott was 25% lower than 2019, due to a 28% reduction in grade and the optimisation of molybdenum ore during the extended shutdown of the smelter, which, in combination with higher molybdenum grades, led to an 82% increase in the production of molybdenum concentrate. Development in the pit progressed despite COVID-19 disruptions. We expect grades to gradually increase from 2021, as mining transitions from the east to the south wall.\n\nRe/fined copper production was 54% lower than 2019 due to the rebuild of the /flash converting furnace, required following the earthquake, and delays in restarting the smelter following planned major maintenance in mid-2020. The smelter was safely restarted and became fully operational in October.\n\n## Escondida\n\nEscondida's mined copper production was 1% lower than 2019, mainly due to 15% lower material stacked onto the leaching pads. This was a result of preventive measures in response to COVID-19, which were mostly offset by 5% higher concentrator throughput in 2020. Re/fined copper was also impacted by lower material stacked onto the leach pads.",

Access to higher copper and gold grades is expected to continue in 2021. We maintained shipments across the Chinese border despite COVID-19 measures in Mongolia and continue to work closely with the authorities to manage the risk of supply chain disruptions.\n\n## Diamonds\n\nDiamond production was 14% lower than 2019, attributable to lower carats recovered at Diavik, where a 10% reduction in grade was partially offset by an increase in tonnes processed, and the closure of Argyle, as planned, on 3 November. We expect to take /five years to decommission the Argyle mine and rehabilitate the area, followed by a further period of monitoring.\n\n## New projects and growth options/uni00A0- Oyu Tolgoi underground project\n\nIn 2020, we progressed the underground project despite restrictions from COVID-19 controls and ongoing international travel restrictions. The project has deployed mitigations that include extended on-site rosters, securing commitments from critical vendors to remain on site for extended periods and layered screening of personnel.\n\nOverall underground lateral development has now reached 53,000 equivalent metres (eqm), with development for /first drawbell substantially complete.\n\nThe project has now exceeded one million tonnes of material moved through shaft 2 since commissioning and the scheduled annual maintenance of the shaft was successfully completed in October 2020 using remote technology.\n\nOn 16 December, we con/firmed the de/finitive estimate of cost and schedule for Panel 0 with sustainable production expected to commence in October 2022 and development capital of $6.75 billion 1 , in line with the ranges /first announced in July 2019. These estimates include the known impacts of COVID-19. 2 /uni00A0Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 480,000 tonnes 3 of copper per year on average, from 2028 to 2036, from the open pit and underground. The underground Ore Reserve has an average copper grade of 1.52%, which is more than three times higher than the open pit Ore Reserve, and contains 0.31 grammes of gold per tonne. 4\n\n## Mined copper production\n\n(000 tonnes - Rio Tinto share)\n\n|   2016 | 523.3 523.3   |\n|--------|---------------|\n|   2017 | 472.4 472.4   |\n|   2018 | 607.6 607.6   |\n|   2019 | 577.4 577.4   |\n|   2020 | 527.9 527.9   |\n\n## Other new projects and growth options\n\nThe $0.9 billion investment in phase one of the south wall pushback project at Kennecott, which will extend mine life to 2026, remains on track. We expect to gradually access higher grades made available from this project from 2021. The $1.5 billion investment in phase two (stripping and additional infrastructure development), which is also on track, will allow mining to move into a new area of the ore body for a further six years. Both phases will continue to generate attractive returns for Kennecott.\n\nAt our Resolution Copper project in Arizona, the shaft 9 remediation and sinking project was completed in November, four months ahead of schedule and within budget. On 15 January 2021, we entered the next phase of public comment in the ongoing permitting process, led by the US Forest Service, with the release of its independently prepared Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).\n\nAt the 100% owned Winu copper-gold project in the Paterson Province of Western Australia, we disclosed the maiden Inferred Mineral Resource in July and revealed the discovery of a new zone of gold-dominant mineralisation approximately two kilometres east of the Winu deposit. The Inferred Mineral Resource, reported at a 0.2% copper equivalent cut-off, is 503 million tonnes at 0.45% copper equivalent (CuEq). This includes a higher grade component of 188 million tonnes at 0.68% CuEq at a cut-off grade of 0.45% CuEq. 5 Drilling and /fieldwork activities continue, with 90 kilometres of drilling completed in 2020. We are actively engaging with the Traditional Owners through on-country heritage surveys, monitoring and agreement making, which is expected to continue into 2021, with /first ore now expected in 2024, subject to regulatory approvals, Traditional Owner and other consents and COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2020, our Copper & Diamonds product group's greenhouse gas emissions were 2.7Mt CO 2 e (on an equity basis), a reduction of 0.9Mt/uni00A0CO 2 e compared to our 2018 emissions baseline.\n\nAfter discontinuing the use of a coal-/fired power plant at Kennecott in 2019, all of the electricity purchased by Kennecott and our Resolution Copper project in 2020 was covered by the renewable energy certi/ficates supplied by Rocky Mountain Power. These certi/ficates offset the carbon emissions from all of the Scope 2 purchased electricity emissions in 2020 for both assets. The renewable energy certi/ficate programme is Green-e Energy certi/fied, and meets the environmental and consumer protection standards set by the Center for Resource Solutions.\n\nOur diamond operations have reduced diesel usage through wind power at the Diavik Diamond Mine in northern Canada and hydropower at the Argyle mine in Western Australia. As part of our product group sustainability strategy, we continue to advance abatement options and technology to work towards ongoing emissions reductions.",

Located in north east Canada, IOC is a fully integrated business with mine, processing, railway, and port facilities able to optimise and deliver value. In 2020, we introduced autonomous electric drills, controlled remotely by operators at IOC's Integrated Operations Centre, after a successful initial pilot in 2019. These are some of the /first of their kind to be used autonomously in North America.\n\nOur Simandou iron ore joint-venture project in Guinea is one of the world's largest untapped and richest high-grade iron ore deposits, and complements our existing world-class iron ore portfolio. With an increasing focus on emissions and decarbonisation across the global steel industry, demand for high-grade ores is expected to continue to grow - and Simandou can be a key pillar for Rio Tinto's role in this transition. Work continues on the technical optimisation of the project, with preparatory activity for an update of the project's Environmental and Social Impact Assessment underway. We continue to engage with the government of Guinea about potential mechanisms for collaboration on infrastructure development.\n\n## TiO 2 & critical minerals\n\nOur iron and titanium business is a major global producer of high-grade titanium dioxide with operations in Canada, Madagascar and South Africa. The nature of the orebodies allows us to produce by-products such as scandium and monazite. Monazite is a combination of rare earth elements such as neodymium used in powerful permanent magnets found in electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators.\n\n## Snapshot of the year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy & Minerals in /figures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have developed an innovative process to extract high-purity scandium oxide from waste generated by titanium dioxide production in Quebec, Canada. Scandium oxide is used to improve the performance of solid oxide fuel cells, a new clean energy technology used as a power source for data centres and hospitals. It is also used to produce high-performance aluminium-scandium master alloys for the aerospace, defence and 3-D printing industries .\n\n## Borates & lithium\n\nOur borates business - U.S. Borax - supplies approximately 30% of the global demand for borates, used in everything from agriculture to /fibreglass insulation and sanitation and is a input into personal care products, laundry detergents and industrial cleaning agents. At our Boron operations in California, US, we have built a demonstration plant to extract lithium as a by-product. This plant has the capacity to produce 10 tonnes per year of battery grade lithium-carbonate, used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles and consumer electronics.\n\nIn Serbia, we continue to progress Jadar, a unique, world-class lithiumborate deposit, with the project moving to the feasibility study stage in 2020. The project has the potential to supply the electric vehicle value chain for decades. An investment decision is due at the end of 2021.\n\n## Uranium\n\nWe also own interests in a uranium business - Energy Resources of Australia (ERA, 86.3%) - and a uranium project in Canada. ERA's processing operations ceased on 8 January 2021. A structured programme of progressive rehabilitation will be completed by 2026.\n\n## 35%\n\nunderlying EBITDA margin (product group operations)\n\n(2019: 37%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $1.1bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnet cash generated from operating activities\n\n(2019: $1.4bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nproducts\n\nproducts from mining by-products",

The all-injury frequency rate decreased to 0.41 (down from 0.43 in 2019), the result of continued safety coaching and emphasis on leadership on the ground.\n\nWe were pleased to record, in 2020, another year with zero fatalities. However, in October 2020, one of our Richards Bay Minerals employees, in South Africa, sustained a permanent disabling injury. The employee's rehabilitation is progressing well and we will continue to support him and his family. As we always do in such instances, we have shared the analysis and lessons learned across the Group to help prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nOur ongoing commitment to reduce signi/ficant process safety incidents resulted in /five process safety incidents in 2020, down from eight in 2019.\n\nOur QMM operations in Madagascar delivered one of the best safety performances across the Group, with no recordable injuries and an all-injury frequency rate of 0.00. Three other E&M sites, Jadar, Simandou and Suzhou, also ended the year with no recordable injuries.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to implement the safety maturity model across our sites with a focus on leadership coaching and impactful leadership interactions. Our programmes to eliminate fatalities and decrease risks related to major hazards remain at the core of our 2021 strategy.\n\n## COVID-19 response\n\nWith operations across Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa and North America we saw a signi/ficant spread of COVID-19 related impacts over the course of the year.\n\nWe have put in place a range of COVID-19 speci/fic measures across the business to align with directives from governments and health authorities in our jurisdictions. As a result, we have secured the con/fidence of our local governments allowing us to continue to operate as essential businesses. We mobilised signi/ficant resources across our business to keep our employees safe and provide critical support to our communities - ranging from food and water security to PPE and equipment provisioning for health facilities.\n\nIn Canada, we made alternative housing available for victims of domestic violence and we donated hand sanitiser produced at site. We donated funds to offer food assistance and distanced learning support to families in the communities near our Boron operations in California, US. In Guinea and South Africa, we partnered with local sewing businesses to manufacture cloth masks. In Madagascar, we transformed one of our building into a fully equipped medical treatment centre to assist local health authorities.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nThe business was /flexible and resilient from an operational perspective, while fully complying with signi/ficant government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions, notably in Canada, the US and South Africa. At Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), we took advantage of stronger market conditions in Asia in the /first half of the year and switched our product mix, prioritising concentrate over pellets, and then returned to higher pellet production as European demand recovered.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $1.6 billion was 7% lower than 2019 with IOC shipping 8% higher volumes and bene/fiting from stronger pricing, while Minerals (titanium dioxide feedstocks and borates) were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions and weaker market conditions.\n\nWe progressed our evaluation studies with funding approved for the Jadar lithium-borate feasibility study and activity starting at the mine area of the Simandou iron ore project.\n\nWe generated net cash of $1.1 billion from our operating activities, a 24% decline on 2019, driven by the same trends as/uni00A0underlying EBITDA and the timing of tax payments from higher pro/fits at IOC in 2019, with the /final payments made in 2020. Free cash /flow of $0.6 billion re/flected tight control of capital expenditure, down 22% on 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Review of operations/uni00A0\n\n## Uranium/uni00A0\n\nOur share of uranium production was 9% higher than 2019, primarily due to the change in our shareholding (from 68.4% to 86.3%) following completion of ERA's entitlement offer in February 2020. ERA's Ranger operation continued to process existing stockpiles uninterrupted in 2020, with production ceasing on 8 January 2021.\n\n## Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC)\n\nProduction of pellets and concentrate at IOC was 1% lower than 2019 due to unplanned maintenance at the processing facilities in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n## Minerals\n\nTitanium dioxide slag production of 1.1 million tonnes was 7% lower than 2019 due to COVID-19 restrictions in Quebec and South Africa, lower market demand and operational disruptions at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM). With the COVID-19 resurgence in Quebec and South Africa, we continue to operate our assets with extensive measures in place to ensure the safety of our employees and communities.\n\nBorates production was 8% lower than 2019 due to a period of lower demand related to COVID-19 uncertainty resulting in an adjustment to re/finery operating rates. The extension of a planned shutdown impacted fourth quarter production.\n\n## New projects and growth options/uni00A0\n\nThe $463 million Zulti South construction project at RBM remains on full suspension. We will assess a restart after normalisation of operations.\n\nAt the 100%-owned Jadar lithium-borate project in western Serbia, we progressed to the feasibility study stage, following Board approval of almost $200 million, with the studies expected to be complete by the end of 2021.

In December, we disclosed a maiden Ore Reserve and updated Mineral Resource. The Ore Reserve is 16.6 million tonnes at 1.81% Li 2 O and 13.4% B 2 O 3 . 1 Jadar would be capable of producing approximately 55 thousand tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate, as well as 160 thousand tonnes of boric acid (B 2 O 3 units) and 255 thousand tonnes of sodium sulphate as by-products per annum. 2 Due to the different reporting system used in Serbia, Jadar also submitted its 'Elaborate of Resources and Reserves' to the Serbian Mining Ministry in the fourth quarter of 2020. This document was approved, and the respective Certi/ficate was received on 6 January 2021. The adoption of 'Elaborate of Resources and Reserves' allowed the project to then immediately submit the application for exploitation /field licence which provides tenure for the deposit. In accordance with Serbian regulations, this permit is expected within the coming months.\n\nAt the Simandou iron ore project 3 in Guinea, we expect to complete the /first phase of the technical optimisation work on the infrastructure components in the /first half of 2021. Activity in the mine area is starting including roadworks. We are making progress with implementation of the project's Social and Environmental Impact Assessment.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2020, Energy & Minerals' absolute greenhouse emissions were 3.6Mt CO 2 e, a reduction of 0.1Mt CO 2 e from 2018 levels. The decrease in emissions was driven by reductions in production and energy consumption mainly due to the response to COVID-19.\n\n## Titanium dioxide slag production\n\n(thousand tonnes - Rio Tinto share)",

While some of these initiatives were small, they are nevertheless a clear demonstration of the ingenuity and pioneering spirit for which our company is known.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Working safer and smarter\n\nTechnology played an essential role in helping us keep our operations running, smoothly and safely, during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we partnered with a data analytics specialist and used arti/ficial intelligence (AI) to help us anticipate emerging COVID-19 risks across geographies so we could adjust resources and controls - such as of/fice access - in higher-risk regions.\n\nOur iron ore business in the Pilbara, Western Australia, introduced antibody testing to supplement screening tests at domestic airports for our /fly-in, /fly-out workforce, enabling our business to continue operating while minimising the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n\nWe increased our use of drones and mine pit cameras and introduced video headsets, so we could continue to conduct visual inspections of tailings facilities and equipment while complying with travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements. At the Oyu Tolgoi underground project, we used Vuzix smart glasses - based on augmented reality letting technical experts from all over the world work with local teams.\n\nWe also continued to innovate as part of our broader health and safety programme: for example, our Weipa bauxite team in Queensland, Australia, designed a custom-made mechanical arm to open and close tailings valves, reducing the risk of injuries.\n\n## Product innovation\n\nThis year we launched three new products by either extracting valuable metals from waste - or by creating a new product from the waste itself. All three reduced the amount of waste sent to land/fills, created useful products and helped customers meet their sustainability goals.\n\nAt our Boron operations in California, US, we engineered a way to extract lithium - a critical mineral used in clean technologies - from waste rock. In December, we commissioned a demonstration plant capable of producing 10 metric tonnes per year of battery grade lithium-carbonate, allowing us to assess the technical, economic and commercial feasibility of progressing to a production scale plant.\n\nIn our Aluminium business, approximately 85% of the 400,000 tonnes of waste (excluding bauxite residue) created by our Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean operations is used to make new products. In 2020, we partnered with leading sustainable construction materials company/uni00A0Lafarge Canada to launch Alextra, a new product made from treated spent pot lining used to produce cement. Lafarge Canada will make around one million tonnes a year of cement using Alextra.\n\nAnd we continue to improve our anhydrite fertiliser product, made from aluminium process waste, via funding research by Universit\u00e9 Laval and Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi, with the governments of Canada and Quebec, providing data that helps farmers optimise anhydrite application. We also partnered with Quebec's Resolute Forest Products to explore the use of anhydrite with by-products from their paper mills - which, when combined, could become an even more ef/ficient 'super fertiliser'.",

This included:\n\n- -Committing $10 million to advance our climate partnership, announced in 2019, with China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University. This will fund the joint establishment of a Low Carbon Raw Materials Preparation Research and Development Centre\n- -Committing $4.5 million to support research projects at the Tsinghua-Rio Tinto Joint Research Centre for Resources, Energy and Sustainable Development over the next /five years\n- -Signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Nippon Steel Corporation to jointly explore, develop and demonstrate technologies to transition to a low-carbon emission steel value chain.\n\nThis year marked our third year as the industry partner of the Foundation for Australia-Japan Studies, a not-for-pro/fit organisation that encourages collaboration between academic institutions, government and industry in Australia and Japan. Since 2018, we have funded ten research projects ranging from low-carbon desalination technology to robotics.\n\nAnd through our Pioneer Portal, which crowd-sources innovation from outside the company, we received more than 370 submissions from entrepreneurs, start-ups and businesses, helping us source new ideas to address business challenges. These range from designing robots to minimising risks associated with cleaning large storage tanks to /finding ways to reuse rail sleepers.\n\n## Driving ef/ficiency\n\nWe continued to use machine learning and predictive analytics to increase productivity at our operations as well as support our exploration efforts globally.\n\nAt Gudai-Darri (Koodaideri) we are shaping new ways of working - some never seen in our business or industry. Set to be one of the world's most automated mines, Gudai-Darri's autonomous /fleet will include the world's /first autonomous water carts, to be launched in 2021. Delivered through a partnership with equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, the water carts will join our autonomous heavy mobile equipment /fleet including haul trucks and autonomous drills.\n\nWe also piloted two autonomous electric drills at the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC). Among the /first of their kind, the trial showed the system delivered increased safety and productivity bene/fits compared with standard rigs. By allowing a single operator to monitor multiple drills from IOC's Integrated Operations Centre in Labrador City, drilling can continue safely in conditions un/fit for teams on the ground, such as blizzards, freezing temperatures and electrical storms.\n\n2020 marked one year since we established our Operations Centre in Brisbane, which now provides an end-to-end view of our Weipa and Gove bauxite mines. Among other bene/fits, the Centre has helped us better plan bauxite grades for our local re/fineries, optimise shipping schedules from the mines and deliver savings through lower processing costs.\n\nPredicta, our data science and advanced analytics service, combines specialist engineering knowledge with data science tools and processes to help prevent critical asset failure. Predicta enables consistent equipment performance, minimises down time and reduces maintenance costs. For example, at our Pilbara iron ore operations in Western Australia, Predicta helped our ore crushers reduce lost production time by 94%. We have deployed Predicta at 19 operating sites, and we plan to expand it to more in the future.\n\nAt our Pilbara iron ore operations, we implemented a predictive model to inform ore blending strategies and help minimise blockages and unscheduled downtime at our processing plants. A pilot deployed at our Hope Downs 1 mine in 2019 con/firmed the model helped reduce downtime in the plant by 40%. We have rolled out models at a further /five Pilbara mines, and we continue to improve the accuracy of those deployed.",

By harnessing the skills, knowledge and insights we acquire from everything we buy, sell and move around the world, we focus on deepening customer and market insights, improving connections and accelerating decisions between our markets and assets and partnering with customers and suppliers to generate additional value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, while trade /flows were disrupted due to COVID-19 restrictions, we continued to ful/fil our customer and supplier orders and ensured our operations had the materials they needed to continue operating safely.\n\nThis year, we continued to expand our commercial activities into new areas to meet customer needs and maximise the value of our physical /flows. In Iron Ore, for example, we grew our portside sales presence in China to nine ports, adding more than 80 new customers to our business. In Aluminium, we established bonded warehouses for alumina in Qingdao, Lianyungang, and Bayuquan in China to enable just-in-time deliveries, greater /flexibility through inventory management, and access to new customers. In addition, by providing strong 'virtual' technical and customer support, we were able to successfully deliver bauxite to a new customer facing COVID-19-related supply disruptions.\n\nWe also used the challenges presented by COVID-19 - such as the inability to exchange physical documentation - as a catalyst for us to expand digital interfaces with customers and suppliers. For example, we completed the industry's /first end-to-end blockchain transaction in Renminbi, with the China Baowu Steel Group. We will continue to pilot and adopt new digital tools to improve our customers' and suppliers' experience.\n\nThis year, we also progressed a range of partnerships and programmes aligned with our product stewardship strategy and our customers' growing demand for responsibly produced materials. Key achievements included:\n\n- -Our Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi operations were the /first in the world to be awarded the Copper Mark - the industry's independent assurance programme - verifying our copper is responsibly produced.\n\n- -We announced a partnership with AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, to produce beverage cans made from low-carbon aluminium that meets industry-leading sustainability standards.\n- -We are working with Shawinigan Aluminium Inc to provide our aluminium customers in Canada and the US with high-quality alloys made with recycled content from 2021.\n- -We began trialling the production of small quantities of high-performance aluminium-scandium master alloys, using scandium oxide recovered from waste created from the titanium dioxide production process.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2020, we continued to prioritise the safety, health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and stakeholders, with an increased focus on mental wellbeing.\n\nCOVID-19 added an additional layer to the diverse range of risks we face across our global sales and marketing, procurement and marine and logistics activities. For example, to manage the risks to seafarers from restrictions on crew changeovers, we continue to work with the industry, our shipowner partners and regulators to facilitate crew changes and protect crew welfare.\n\nIn addition, our primary focus has been on maintaining critical risk management fatality prevention programmes across areas of greatest exposure - primarily marine and logistics, and procurement - while implementing mental and physical wellbeing initiatives to help employees balance work and personal priorities. In 2020, we had zero fatalities and a 0.11 all-injury frequency rate. In 2021, we intend to continue to make mental health and wellbeing a central part of our employee initiatives.",

As we begin 2021, there is evidence of a new investment cycle amid accommodative monetary policy and extensive deployment of /fiscal policy around the world. However, ongoing efforts to contain COVID-19 remain a headwind, and geopolitical tensions present risks to the outlook.\n\nChina was the only major economy to record positive GDP growth this year, logging growth of 2.3%. The growth was commodity intensive, following the government's rapid response and stimulus that accelerated infrastructure projects and encouraged construction. While continued positive momentum is expected in 2021, China's recovery is transitioning to a more broad-based upswing in consumption and private sector investment. In the longer term, the trend of income growth in emerging markets, including those in ASEAN countries and India, will continue to drive global commodity demand. In China, strong commodity demand will be increasingly driven by the government's urban agglomeration and decarbonisation targets, as well as a drive for self-suf/ficiency, which will continue to grow the manufacturing sector.\n\n## Iron ore\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a disparate impact on iron ore demand in 2020: solid growth in China's imports more than offset the contractions in other regions. Scrap collection and availability were signi/ficantly disrupted by the pandemic, further supporting iron ore demand at a time when weather events constrained supply from the major producing regions. As a result, the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron /fines converted to an FOB basis rose 19% in 2020. With the exception of products sold at ports in China, all of our Pilbara products are priced with reference to the 62% index.\n\nGlobal steel production contracted by 1.2% year-on-year in 2020, as China lifted its steel production output to a record 1.05 billion tonnes, which compensated for the 9% contraction in the rest of the world. Pandemic-related capacity and production cuts in Europe, Japan and the US brought steel output down by 12-17% compared with 2019. India, the world's second largest steel producer, recorded a 11% year-on-year contraction in 2020. Combined crude steel production in the world, ex-China, recovered to 2019 levels for the /first time in October 2020 and grew year-on-year during Q4 2020.\n\nWeather events in Brazil and Australia during the /first half of 2020 curtailed seaborne iron ore supply, but the cumulative shipments of the major producers increased by 2 % (~25Mt) over the year. Meanwhile, China's domestic iron ore supply expanded by ~20Mt year-on-year to ~290Mt and helped meet record demand in 2020, as elevated iron ore prices incentivised some previously idled small-scale mines to restart operations during the second half of the year. Re/flecting the demand disparity between domestic and export markets, China's net /finished steel exports also contracted by 36% year-on-year to 33Mt in/uni00A02020.\n\nDue to robust demand and global supply constraints, the market for iron ore concentrate and pellets was strong throughout the year. This is expected to continue into 2021 as more steel producers requiring high-grade, low impurity pellets increase production and global supply constraints persist.\n\n## Aluminium\n\nAluminium primary demand declined by ~3.0% in 2020, following a fall of ~1.0% in 2019. COVID-19 severely impacted consumption this year, but with notable regional differences in recovery rates: gradual in the developed world with China experiencing a strong V-shaped recovery. Demand in the transport sector has been especially weak in 2020, but it has been robust in the packaging sector. We expect overall demand to rebound in 2021, but ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and political risks remain.\n\nThe alumina market remained in moderate surplus, and low prices have resulted in a high level of idled capacity in inland China.\n\nChina continues to drive demand in the global seaborne bauxite market as result of stricter environmental measures and the depletion of domestic bauxite. Chinese bauxite imports rose by ~11% to 112Mt in 2020 on the back of increased imports from Guinea, Australia and Indonesia.\n\n## Copper & Diamonds\n\nCopper prices fell to a low of 209c/lb in March 2020 as COVID-19 severely impacted demand. The price rebound was led by recovering Chinese demand and supply tightness due to reduced scrap availability and mined supply disruptions. Chinese inventories subsequently reached their lowest level in over eight years and LME stocks fell to their lowest in 15 years. Prices reached a seven-year high of 361c/lb in December 2020, more than 70% higher than the low earlier in the year, as net-long investor positions (on COMEX and LME) reached the equivalent of 2Mt. However, the rate of recovery in growth is slowing in many economies and the rise of renewed lockdowns threatens the recovery.\n\nPolicy direction in the medium term indicates a strong copper-intensive outlook with the continued rise of electric vehicles, potential green stimulus packages around the world and China's push for carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nIn diamonds, a heavy decline in spending on jewellery impacted underlying demand, while lockdowns in India's manufacturing centres restricted the volume of rough diamonds purchased from miners.\n\n## Energy & Minerals\n\nUnderlying demand for titanium dioxide pigment fell sharply in the second quarter of 2020 leading to a deterioration of feedstock demand by the middle of the year. Leading indicators suggest a recovery in 2021. Structural factors remain favourable for high-grade TiO2 feedstock and zircon supply.\n\nMedium- to long-term demand for borates is tied to increases in wealth and living standards but is prone to short-term shocks, as witnessed in 2020. A decline in demand impacted all regions globally and coincided with a reduction of supply volumes. A moderate recovery is expected in 2021.",

We decided to/uni00A0focus on the two goals - SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) - that we feel are most relevant to operating our business responsibly.\n\nSDG 12 relates to how we - as a custodian of natural and mineral resources - mine, process and produce materials and contribute to ethical global supply chains, including trusted lifecycle assessments. This SDG builds on our existing health, safety, environment and community performance standards and our membership of responsible production and product stewardship programmes, including the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, Copper Mark, the International Council on Mining and Metal's Performance Expectations, the Responsible Jewellery Council and the Mining Association of Canada's Towards Sustainable Mining.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 8 speaks directly to our values and priorities, including our commitments to creating a safe and inclusive working environment, as well as promoting education and training partnerships that support social and economic development, including by helping to develop skills for the future.

We believe that all injuries can be prevented. We continue to make the safety of our colleagues and communities our /first priority.\n\nIn 2020, for the second year running, we achieved zero fatalities. Over the past ten years, both the severity of injuries and our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) have fallen signi/ficantly, from 0.69 in 2010 to 0.37 in 2020. Compared to 2019, our AIFR has improved by almost 12%.\n\nWhile we are pleased by this performance, there is no question we can and must do better. This year, two employees suffered permanent disabling injuries: an employee lost his hand at Richards Bay Minerals, our titanium dioxide operation in South Africa, and a contractor was permanently injured at the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada. We are supporting both colleagues and their families, and are committed to learn from and prevent these tragic incidents from recurring.\n\nOur aluminium business is progressing its /five-year plan to reduce health risk exposures by improving monitoring and implementing engineering controls, such as ventilation. We expanded the use of technology to support our fatigue management programmes and eliminate fatigue-related incidents. We also expanded our global health team to/uni00A0ensure we have the right support for occupational health and industrial hygiene matters.\n\nWe have also embarked on a systematic programme of minimising with/uni00A0the goal of ultimately eliminating - diesel particulates from our underground mines. We are doing so by measuring diesel exhaust emissions and installing and upgrading diesel particulate /filters on our existing diesel equipment /fleets. We are in the process of investigating the transition to either battery electric or higher-tiered, cleaner engines where mobile battery electric equipment is not yet available.\n\nWellbeing has also been a key focus throughout 2020, particularly with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Lives were upended, with families separated due to border closures and extensive quarantines, parents needed to balance working from home with raising their children, and all of us were required to adjust. In response, we introduced more /flexible work schedules, virtual care packs and ensured greater access to health and medical resources.\n\nWe have worked hard over many years on mental health and our strong foundation enabled us to respond quickly to the crisis. Importantly, our People Survey results showed employees felt supported during this challenging time.\n\n## Safety and health performance 1 2016-20\n\n|                                                            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fatalities at managed operations                           | 0      | 0      | 3      | 1      | 1      |\n| All-injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked)       | 0.37   | 0.42   | 0.44   | 0.42   | 0.44   |\n| Number of lost time injuries                               | 189    | 228 2  | 226 2  | 199    | 206    |\n| Lost time injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked) | 0.22   | 0.27   | 0.27   | 0.25   | 0.26   |\n| Safety maturity model (SMM) score                          | 5.4    | 4.5    | -      | -      | -      |\n| New cases of occupational illness (per 10,000 employees)   | 15.7   | 21.5 2 | 29.6   | 24.6   | 47.3   |\n| Number of employees 3                                      | 47,500 | 46,000 | 47,500 | 47,000 | 51,000 |\n\n- 2.

        "page_content": "## COVID-19\n\nIn 2020, COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic. We quickly assessed the challenges for our company, communities, contractors and employees and instituted controls to keep people safe and healthy from the virus and allow our operations to run safely and smoothly.\n\nThe protocols we put in place include those in line with government guidance, directives and best practice advice from leading medical experts and international health organisations. Our measures included: travel restrictions, social distancing, increased personal hygiene, and greater support for employees in areas such as mental health, managing fatigue and adjusting to working from home as well.\n\nEvery mine, operation and of/fice adopted a set of screening measures, such as health questionnaires and temperature screening. In addition, for most locations, we were able to implement virus screening. This work has been closely co-ordinated with local governments. For example, our Pilbara iron ore business introduced antibody screening to supplement our rapid screening measures at domestic airports in Western Australia for our /fly-in, /fly-out (FIFO) workforce.\n\nWe also partnered with a data analytics specialist and used arti/ficial intelligence (AI) to help us anticipate emerging local COVID-19 geographic risks so we could adjust resources and controls in those regions. For example, this tool helped us identify the best time to\n\nstrengthen or relax control measures, such as when employees could safely return to of/fices in different jurisdictions.\n\nWe continue to ensure affected employees have the medical support they need when they, or their families, are affected by the virus. We know it is a challenging time for many people and we are closely tracking the wellbeing and fatigue of our employees and offering support as needed. In addition to our employee assistance programme (EAP), for employees and their families, this support includes the following:\n\n- -Adapting our leave and pay bene/fits, such as offering our vulnerable employees special leave\n- -Providing /flexible work arrangements\n- -Developing 'virtual care packs' with key information on resources/uni00A0available\n- -Providing telemedicine resources in several locations\n\n## An example of operating safely during COVID-19: Iron Ore, Pilbara, Western Australia\n\nOur Iron Ore business in Western Australia employs 13,600 people. The majority of our operations are based in the Pilbara region, more than 1,000 kilometres from Perth, and include a signi/ficant /fly-in, /fly-out (FIFO) workforce.\n\nMinimising the risk of COVID-19 transmission among our FIFO employees and contractors was essential to continue operating safely, and in compliance with government directives.\n\nFrom March to August, we implemented longer rosters (two-week-on, two-weekoff) for thousands of people to reduce the risk of spreading the virus by reducing the frequency of travel in and out of the Pilbara. To service these changes, we secured additional charter /flights, ensuring compliance with physical distancing guidelines by spacing people appropriately on planes and in airports. To comply with travel restrictions, we also relocated more than 700 employees with specialist skills to Perth so they could continue in their roles.\n\nWe introduced a /five-layer screening process - conducted by trained medical staff - at the Perth, Busselton, Geraldton and Albany airports for FIFO employees and contractors returning to work. This included:\n\n- -A health questionnaire prior to travelling to screen for potential exposure to COVID-19, consistent with government restrictions on intra-state travel\n- -A face-to-face assessment with a nurse on arrival at the airport\n- -Temperature checks via an electronic thermometer\n- -Antibody testing, via a small blood sample, to check for virus-related antibodies. If antibodies were detected, the employee was tested for COVID-19 via a nasopharyngeal swab (Perth airport) or referred to an approved COVID-19 testing clinic (regional airports). They were also required to self-isolate as a precaution\n- -An access band allowing employees who were cleared by the screening process to board their /flight\n\nWe also changed the way we worked on the ground. For example, we implemented stronger controls on access to our sites and used technology - such as drones and mine pit cameras - to conduct monitoring activities, reducing the need to visit site. Our health and safety teams put a range of safeguards in place: rooms were measured and marked out to indicate maximum capacity, crosses marked on /floors to indicate physical distancing guidelines, and we increased the frequency of cleaning high-touch areas.\n\nWe also supported medically vulnerable employees, ensuring appropriate medical assessments were undertaken. We also made necessary work arrangements to protect their health.\n\nTo support our FIFO teams - many of whom were spending more time away from their families - we provided an on-call service so they could return home for health or family emergencies.\n\nIn addition, we offered a hotline providing employees with health assessments by medical advisers on /fitness for work, including fatigue management. We also provided mental health support through our employee assistance programme.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\n## continued\n\n## Health and wellbeing\n\n## Domestic violence programme\n\nWe want our employees to feel safe at work and at home. We are proud of our industry-leading programme to help support victims of domestic violence. In 2020, we extended this programme to more than 98% of our employees globally, with plans to extend it across the entire Group. Through the programme, we provide special leave, emergency accommodation, /financial support, and training to equip leaders and employees to step in and help - safely and effectively. We also provided additional support to community partners during the pandemic. As part of an effort to make our communities across Canada safer, we donated C$360,000 to 12 women's shelters and local organisations providing a variety of support for women and families impacted by domestic violence.\n\n## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nMental health continues to emerge as a pressing issue, not only for Rio Tinto but for the world at large - a situation exacerbated by COVID-19. For more than 20 years, we have provided peer support programmes, with specially trained employees playing a pivotal role in supporting their colleagues at local level. Over the past /five years, we have extended mental health training for leaders and employees, including to raise awareness about psychosocial hazards so that they can recognise a problem before it develops - and help.\n\nIn 2020, largely but not exclusively in response to the pandemic, we further strengthened our focus on mental health. We introduced a mental health framework that consolidates various policies, procedures and programmes, making it easier for colleagues to provide support and easier for employees to access it. We offer different kinds of support, including our employee assistance programme (EAP), which includes counselling by professional psychologists, telemedicine in some regions, peer support programmes and online educational tools.\n\n## Occupational health\n\nIn 2020, we recorded fewer occupational health illnesses, and conducted more than 65,000 health control veri/fications, a 12.6% increase over 2019. And, starting in early April, we conducted 193,000 COVID-19 control veri/fications to assess the ef/ficacy of our health controls, such as physical distancing and hygiene controls. COVID-19 protocols designed to protect health workers placed restrictions on the ability to conduct employee medical exams. We are looking at ways to address this, though in much of the world, at the time of this writing, restrictions are back in place.\n\n## Strengthening safety systems\n\nEliminating fatalities requires a strong safety culture coupled with systems designed to mitigate risk and continually improve the safety of our work. Our safety maturity model (SMM), introduced in 2019, provides a roadmap for leaders to advance the foundations of safety without being overly prescriptive. These foundations include leadership and engagement, learning and improvement, risk management and work planning and execution. Annually, we assess assets' progress against each of these elements.\n\nIn 2020, our assessment of SMM gave us valuable insights into the effectiveness of safety leadership, key processes and controls. The average score across our operational sites improved, with the most signi/ficant improvement around site leadership and coaching.\n\nWe continue to focus on strengthening our safety culture, in part by training our employees on best practices. In 2020, for example, we embedded master coaches in each product group to build safety leadership capabilities. This included conducting effective pre-start meetings/uni00A0and providing engaging feedback in the /field. By creating a virtual programme, we ensured this coaching could continue despite COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nCritical Risk Management (CRM) - a tool our operations use to verify that fatality prevention controls are in place before starting each task continues to be fundamental to our business. Since introducing CRM in 2015, our safety, fatality and potentially fatal incident (PFI) performance has markedly improved. We also expanded CRM to include COVID-19 critical controls, ranging from physical distancing measures to travel arrangements. We also completed more than 1.3 million CRM veri/fications, not including the 193,000 associated with COVID-19 critical controls. To help us gauge the quality of veri/fication checks, we track the number of comments or evidence submitted with non-compliant veri/fications. Analysis indicates more than 84% of the non-compliant veri/fications completed by leaders had comments and supporting evidence. We are now looking at ways to improve the quality of veri/fications completed by frontline teams most exposed to critical risks.\n\nFinally, we continue to report, investigate and learn from PFIs. In 2020, we introduced the PFI rapid sharing and learning system, which ensures lessons from PFIs are shared directly with all leaders approximately 3,500. Detailed learnings are also shared when each PFI investigation is complete. In addition, the executive leader for each business unit conducts a 'deep dive' on the incident to ensure the underlying causes are well understood and the right follow-up measures are identi/fied and tracked - to completion - to prevent a future occurrence.\n\n## Safety standards\n\nWe do everything we can to prevent catastrophic events, including those involving tailings and water storage facilities, chemicals, underground mining and process safety. We identify major hazard risks (low-probability, high-consequence events) and manage them by verifying controls, conducting external reviews and requiring compliance with standards and procedures - such as our tailings and water storage facilities' management standard (for more information, please see the Tailings section).\n\nOur standards (available on our website) and procedures provide a consistent approach to managing major hazards across our managed operations. We audit managed operations against our standards and require our businesses to meet their health and safety performance requirements and targets. In addition, we conducted major hazard reviews with each product group.\n\nWe advanced our work around process safety with the introduction of 'technology guardians'. These are senior technical professionals, based either onsite or near our operations, responsible for assuring we have strong risk-based controls to manage process changes and maintain asset and process control integrity. We have completed competency assessments for our technical support and are implementing detailed training and coaching to address any gaps/uni00A0identi/fied.\n\nIn 2020, we completed a comprehensive risk review for underground hazards; in 2021 we will review and update our underground safety standard and associated guidelines. This work is also guiding us as we advance underground technology and improve the technical capability of our operational leaders.\n\nAlso in 2020, we advanced our functional safety standard across the Group, governing the safety controls for technology we use to minimise risks such as obstacle detection and collision avoidance systems in autonomous trucks. The standard includes product assurance by suppliers, periodic testing and ongoing maintenance of these systems.",

There are a further 50 TSFs at non-managed sites. In total, there are 65 active TSFs, 40 are inactive and 53 are closed. Our full tailings disclosure is available on our website.\n\nOur facilities are regulated, permitted and have been managed for many years to comply with local laws, regulations, permits, licences and other requirements. We have classi/fied tailings management as a risk in the Group risk register since 2010 and have had a Group safety standard in place for tailings and water storage facilities since 2015. Our assurance processes verify that our managed facilities around the world operate in accordance with this standard.\n\nAll of our operational TSFs have emergency response plans tested through training exercises - and follow strict business resilience and communications protocols. There have been no external wall failures at our TSFs for more than 20 years.\n\nThis year, we updated our Group safety standard for all tailings and larger water storage facilities. In addition, we reviewed our relevant standards against the requirements of the new global industry standard on tailings management (GISTM), released in August 2020, including how we classify consequences and how and when we implement independent reviews. Our relevant standards are well aligned with the GISTM.\n\nThe GISTM is the result of the Global Tailings Review, a collaboration between the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), of which we are members, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Principles for Responsible Investment. The Review established an international standard for tailings management aimed at preventing catastrophic failure and enhancing the safety of mine tailings facilities around the world. We believe the GISTM will ensure more consistency and rigour in the way the mining industry manages tailings.\n\nWe continued to play an active role in the ICMM tailings working group this year, which focused on the development of the GISTM conformance protocol as well as a tailings guidance document designed to help support industry-wide adoption. We have participated in the tailings working group since 2016, helping inform the ICMM position statement - including the six elements of TSF governance, which are re/flected in our own standard.\n\nIn 2020, we completed the technical risk review programme at each of our managed and non-managed TSFs. The review programme, which began in 2019, found that while our TSFs are generally well managed and there are no immediate dam safety threats, we have opportunities to improve. Accordingly, we have implemented improvement plans for water storage facilities and TSFs and are working towards completing outstanding actions. While global COVID-19 pandemic restrictions delayed a few items, we plan to complete all outstanding actions as quickly as possible, while adhering to restrictions in each jurisdiction.\n\n## This year we also:\n\n- Ensured all operations with TSFs and 'high-consequence' water dams have appointed a Nominated Manager and Quali/fied Site Representative. Nominated Managers are accountable for their site's conformance to our management of the tailings and water storage facilities standard; Quali/fied Site Representatives are accountable for the day-to-day operations and monitoring of tailings facilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Established a new role - the Responsible Dam Engineer - to provide technical support to the Nominated Manager to manage tailings and water storage facility risks\n\nActively engaged with industry forums such as the Canadian Dam Association and the Minerals Council of Australia tailings working groups\n\nCommitted A$2 million over /five years to the Future Tails partnership, a collaboration between Rio Tinto, BHP and the University of Western Australia, which includes training programmes to build talent and capability; publications that summarise state-of-the-art tailings analysis, design, operation and management; and research collaborations with industry to drive further innovation",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n## Communities\n\nTo us, communities aren't just places. They are the people on whom our operations can have an impact, and with whom we strive to build longterm partnerships: Indigenous peoples, landowners, suppliers, neighbours and our colleagues.\n\nThis year, at Juukan Gorge, we did not ful/fil our own values; we did not measure up to our own standards. The destruction of the rock shelters should not have happened, and we are absolutely committed to listening, learning and changing. For more about Juukan Gorge, please refer to pages 10-11.\n\n## Strengthening communities and social performance\n\nTo help transform our relationship with host communities around the world, including Traditional Owners in Australia, we have taken a number of actions:\n\nWe established a Communities and Social Performance (CSP) Area of Expertise (AoE), which will deliver a more rigorous assurance framework across our operations and elevate communities risk processes to align with our robust health and safety systems. The CSP AoE reports to our Group Executive, Safety, Technical and Projects, who is a member of our Executive Committee. While we already conduct social risk analyses at our sites - informed by day-to-day engagement with, and feedback from, communities as well as social and economic impact assessments - the CSP AoE will further strengthen this process.\n\nWe also changed the way we structure our CSP teams globally so that product group and operational leaders have direct responsibility for managing relationships with their host communities, including Indigenous peoples.\n\nWe are currently rolling out the /first phase of a new integrated heritage management process (IHMP), at our Pilbara iron ore operations and will subsequently implement the lessons across our business globally, taking into account local circumstances.\n\nIn the Pilbara, the IHMP involves a systematic review of all the heritage sites that we manage, starting with those that may be impacted by our activities over the next two years. So far, we have reviewed over 1,000 sites and ranked each one by: (i) cultural signi/ficance (which is informed through consultation with the Traditional Owners of the land on which we operate); (ii) our re-con/firmation that we have recently consulted with Traditional Owners for potential impacts; and (iii) the materiality of the impact. Where there is any doubt, we have reclassi/fied the relevant sites from 'cleared' for mining back to 'protected' as a precautionary measure, pending further consultation with the Traditional Owners.\n\nWe also progressed our partnerships with First Nations in Canada. In British Columbia, we signed a Relationship Agreement, called the 'New Day Agreement' with the Cheslatta Carrier Nation. The Agreement formalises commitments relating to training (including collaboration on the Cheslatta Nation remote industry training centre), land, employment and business opportunities and environmental stewardship of the Nechako Reservoir. In Quebec, the Iron Ore Company of Canada signed a Reconciliation and Collaboration Agreement with the Uashat mak Mani-utenam and Matimekush-Lac John communities. We are also progressing a further four agreements with other First Nations communities in Quebec, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.\n\nWe conduct Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) - aligned with international standards, including the ICMM Mining Principles, International Finance Corporation Performance Standards and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights - to help guide new projects as well as\n\ninform closure planning. This year, following the events at Juukan Gorge, we reviewed our social risk analyses across our managed assets to ensure we had a thorough understanding of our potential impacts at each, and that suitable mitigation measures were in place.\n\nAt our Jadar project in Serbia, we are currently undertaking an SIA as part of the feasibility study to complement the Environmental Impact Assessment and ensure that impacts are appropriately identi/fied and managed. We anticipate this study will be completed by the end of 2021, and will be informed by detailed community consultation and participatory methods for identifying impacts and mitigation.\n\nIn 2021, we will also review our CSP standard - which governs how we identify and manage social, economic, environmental, cultural and human rights impacts from exploration to closure - and ensure that all operational leaders understand our commitments.\n\n## An update on Resolution Copper, Arizona, US\n\nAt our Resolution Copper project in Arizona, in the US, we recognise the historical connection Native American Tribes have with the land involved at or near the proposed mine. We acknowledge these connections have endured over centuries.\n\nOne lesson reinforced by the events at Juukan Gorge is that meaningful, transparent engagement with all community members across the entire lifecycle of an asset is critical to shared success. Resolution Copper continues to be committed to ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes and is working to seek consent before any decision on development of the project, consistent with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining.\n\nThe permitting process at Resolution Copper started in 2013, under the Obama Administration. Since that time, the US Forest Service (USFS) has led a rigorous review of the project, including public consultations and extensive engagement with a broad range of stakeholders. This dialogue has led to changes in the project design and the implementation of other measures to address concerns of the local community and Native American Tribes.\n\n## Supporting our communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDonating A$1.25 million over /five years to the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia (Queensland section) to improve emergency and remotely delivered health care services across the state\n\nDonating 25,000 masks and other equipment worth approximately C$100,000 to the local health authority and social services in Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean, in/uni00A0Quebec, Canada",

We created the Emory Oak Restoration & Conservation Program, which recognises this species' importance to the Western Apache.\n\nWe expect to invest in a range of important initiatives during the mine's life, including cultural heritage, education, youth programme support, economic development, environmental mitigation, and recreation.\n\nOn 15 January 2021, after more than seven years of public and 11 years of tribal consultation, the USFS published its Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Resolution Copper. Decisions on whether to invest fully in developing the project remain subject to further permitting processes and a feasibility study conducted over the next several years.\n\n## An update on the Panguna mine, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea (PNG)\n\nThe civil war in Bougainville led to the complete withdrawal of Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, in 1990, from the Panguna mine site it operated. Since that time, no Rio Tinto personnel have visited the site. In June 2016, we transferred our full interest in BCL for no consideration to the PNG government and the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG), providing them with equal shares in BCL.\n\nIn September 2020, the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) /filed a complaint on behalf of 156 Bougainville residents with the Australian National Contact Point (AusNCP) against Rio Tinto regarding the Panguna site. The complaint alleges we are accountable for signi/ficant breaches of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (the OECD Guidelines) relating to past and ongoing environmental and human rights impacts arising from the Panguna mine.\n\nIn response, we have entered into discussions with the HRLC and representatives of the communities that have /filed the complaint using the con/fidential conciliation processes of the AusNCP to support dialogue towards a sustainable solution. These discussions are ongoing including how to scope and safely conduct an independent environmental and human rights impact assessment as well as how to involve other relevant/uni00A0stakeholders.\n\n## An update on CBG, Guinea\n\nThe Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e SA (CBG) is a bauxite operation in Guinea owned by Halco Mining Inc (51%) and the Guinean government (49%). Halco is a consortium comprised of Rio Tinto (45%), Alcoa (45%) and Dadco Investments (10%). We participate on the boards of Halco and CBG, with representation on various shareholder oversight committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- In the Anosy region of Madagascar, upgrading a building and turning it into a dedicated treatment centre that can receive up to 108 patients, and treat 60 people - including up to 32 needing intensive care\n- Providing alternative housing support to a local shelter in Labrador, Canada, for women and children needing a secure refuge\n- Donating more than R6 million to provide critical support for local communities near Richards Bay Minerals, our operation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, including food and water supplies, as well as PPE and essential equipment for frontline health workers and clinics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough our Board and committee roles, we have been proactively monitoring CBG's approach to community issues and its response to the complaint /filed through the International Finance Corporation's grievance mechanism. We have increased our support to CBG by providing additional expert help in the form of a Guinea-based Africa specialist and a senior manager with extensive experience on resettlement and human rights, and are encouraging CBG to work towards a constructive outcome aligned with international standards. More detail on this can be found on our website www.riotinto.com.\n\n## Supporting communities through the pandemic\n\nDuring the COVID-19 global pandemic, we took active measures to reduce the risk of transmission from our employees and contractors to local communities. For example, at our Weipa bauxite operations in far north Queensland, Australia, we worked closely with the local disaster management group, including the town authority and medical department, to develop and implement speci/fic plans in response to the federal government declaring biosecurity health zones. At the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada, where many of our employees come from vulnerable, remote communities, we introduced a range of measures to minimise the risk of transmission, including mandatory testing, calls with medical professionals prior to travel, enhanced hygiene and physical distancing measures, roster and /flight changes, and the mandatory use of masks.\n\nWe have strict protocols in place guiding the way we engage with communities. This includes building two community-related veri/fication steps into our critical risk management system, requiring our teams to assess potential COVID-19 risks to the community and develop a plan to manage them. If, for whatever reason, physical interaction with any community may pose risks, we have asked our employees and partners to turn to non-physical ways to interact, or to cancel or postpone the engagement. Our employees and contractors cannot visit vulnerable communities - those in which underlying health challenges are prevalent, or those in remote areas where health care infrastructure is not strong without the approval of appropriate community and Rio Tinto leadership.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we engaged with our Australian suppliers - many of whom are small businesses - and offered support, /financial or otherwise, to those experiencing hardship.\n\nWe also committed $25 million to help communities during the pandemic. For example, to help support small businesses in /financial stress in the Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada, we partnered with /five municipal governments, the First Nation of Mashteuiatsh and /financial services group Desjardins to create a regional stimulus fund, which provided /financial support for health and safety, productivity and ef/ficiency measures to make businesses more sustainable. The fund, which complemented existing local government initiatives, provided C$750,000 to more than 100 businesses.\n\nDonating \u20ac20,000 to the Red Cross in Belgrade, Serbia, and \u20ac20,000 to the Red Cross in Loznica, Serbia, for essential food and hygiene items for the cities' most vulnerable citizens\n\nWorking with United Food and other partners to distribute more than 100,000 cans of drinking water and donate more than 280,000 meals to the communities near the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, US\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also in 2020, our total discretionary global community investments were $47 million, covering primarily health, education, environmental protection, housing, agricultural and business development sectors.\n\nThe economic and social development of communities continues to be/uni00A0a/uni00A0priority: we strive to employ local people, buy local products and engage local services, and we have targets re/flecting this at each of our/uni00A0operations.\n\nIn Mongolia, for example, between 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2020, Oyu Tolgoi (OT), our copper and gold mine, spent $3.54 billion on national procurement # . OT maintains a dedicated national procurement policy focused on promoting and developing a safe and sustainable local supply chain, which includes the 'Made in Mongolia' strategy. Since 2017, OT has signed 30 contracts with Mongolia-based businesses for goods and services including personal protective items such as FFP2 masks and winter safety gloves, hygiene products such as hand sanitiser and wipes, and specialised professional services.\n\nOT is also partnering with German international development agency GIZ and the Umnugovi Aimag to run a capacity building programme for businesses on topics such as health and safety, business integrity and management, /financial literacy and lean manufacturing. Since 2018, OT/uni00A0has hosted 266 training sessions with more than 3,500 participants from more than 450 small and medium size businesses - 58% of whom were women. Following the training, 72% of the trainees recorded that their businesses expanded, including ten Umnugovi businesses that have become OT suppliers and/or subcontractors.\n\n## Work of the future\n\nThis year, we progressed partnerships that help develop students' skills for the future. For example, in Australia, as part of our four-year A$10 million investment in the education technology sector, we supported the Future Minds Accelerator programme in partnership with leading start-up accelerator BlueChilli and Amazon Web Services. The Future Minds programme engaged 100,000 Australian children, focusing on skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and automation. In addition, the programme provided training and professional development opportunities for 2,700 teachers and engaged more than 1,000 schools, helping drive interest in digital skills among students. The programme also helped the participating start-ups grow their businesses, creating 32 new jobs.\n\nIn Western Australia, 28 high school students participated in the Certi/ficate II in Autonomous Workplace Operations programme, the /first nationally recognised automation quali/fication in Australia, which we launched in partnership with South Metropolitan TAFE (a technical and further education institution). The course, which launched in 2019, is designed to provide participants with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the resources industry of the future.",

        "page_content": "## People\n\n2020 has been a challenging year for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, as COVID-19 signi/ficantly altered our ways of working. Still, our employees told us they were proud to work for a business considered essential during a global pandemic.\n\nThe destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge shocked and deeply disappointed many of our employees. We recognise we must do better - and that doing better must begin with creating an environment in which everyone feels comfortable speaking up.\n\nIn August-September 2020, we conducted virtual employee focus groups across our business, in which almost 1,000 employees participated 72% were site-based and 28% were from our corporate of/fices. These focus groups, which included employees from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives - diverse by gender, ethnicity, location, age and length of service, and with a particular focus on underrepresented groups revealed that employees view Rio Tinto as an industry leader and appreciate the genuine care they feel from their colleagues. However, employee pride has been eroded, particularly in Australia, due to our destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters. And while our employees appreciate our response to COVID-19, life for many is becoming more dif/ficult as the pandemic wears on.\n\nOur employees also said we need a stronger message on sustainability, which is a focus of our new Chief Executive. This includes what sustainability means to us as a business; on matters of inclusion and diversity, they told us we need to take more meaningful action. Partly as a result, we are expanding our diversity targets to include our entire workforce - targeting a 2% increase in female representation - and investing $50 million to increase Indigenous leadership across our business in Australia.\n\nSome of these themes were also mirrored in our annual People Survey employee engagement results, which included more than 64,000 written comments from more than 26,000 employees (a 57% response rate). We/uni00A0were pleased to see a one point increase in our employee net promoter score (eNPS) over the past year. Our employee satisfaction score also increased by one point. This is the sixth consecutive increase, so while we must do better, we also know there are many strengths of which we can be proud and on which we should continue to build.\n\nOur employees continue to share in the success of our business: one way is through myShare, our all-employee global share purchase plan. The number of employees that buy Rio Tinto shares through myShare is today at its highest level, having increased 13% this year; more than 22,000 employees actively contribute every month, with 13,000 contributing the maximum permitted. We have participants in 30+ countries, with 94% in Australia, Canada, the US, Mongolia and South Africa. On average, employees purchase shares worth $14 million each year, and participants hold more than $600 million of shares within their myShare plans (comprising shares bought with their own contributions plus matching shares and shares bought through dividends).\n\nWe continued to invest in skills development throughout 2020. We launched LinkedIn Learning - an online learning tool, providing access to more than 16,000 courses on a wide range of topics and skills. To date, more than 11,000 employees have accessed training on the platform, consuming more than 22,000 hours of content. We are also investing in our critical capabilities: this year, 29 people were formally recognised as technical RioExperts, bringing the total number to 77. Of these, 23% are women. Our/uni00A0/flagship commercial fundamentals programme continued to be deployed virtually. Leadership development also transitioned to virtual, prioritising the development of our leaders to become effective coaches and encourage teams to contribute their full potential. Our average learning hours per employee increased from 25.6 in 2019 to 27.7 in 2020.\n\n## Pay equity\n\nWe seek to provide competitive pay, delivered through fair and nondiscriminatory pay practices and processes. We are committed to ensuring that employees with similar skills, knowledge, quali/fications, experience and performance are paid equally for the same or comparable work. In 2020, we continued to evolve our remuneration to eradicate bias and otherwise enhance the transparency and robustness of our decision/uni00A0making.\n\nOur pay equity statistics (ie 'equal pay gap' and 'gender pay gap') are integral to our monitoring of employee pay; they guide pay decisions and investment during our annual remuneration review. The statistics are affected by gender representation across our organisation (we employ more men than women). We remain focused on improving female representation at all levels.\n\nOur equal pay gap measures the extent to which women and men employed by our company in the same location and performing work of equal value receive the same pay. In 2020, the equal pay gap decreased marginally, compared to 2019, and remains less than 2%. The equal pay gap is the primary lens we use when assessing progress against our ambition to eradicate bias.\n\nGender pay is a measure of the difference between average earnings of women and men across the Group (excluding incentive pay), regardless of role, expressed as a percentage of men's earnings. In 2020, our gender pay gap was just over 1% in favour of women (in 2019, it was less than 1% in favour of men). While part of this positive shift is attributable to decisions made to reduce the gap, which is re/flected in the slightly higher increase in average earnings for women this year, it is also a re/flection of employee movements (attrition, recruitment and promotion) and the fact that more women are in higher-paying roles in our operational workforce.\n\nA key area of focus in 2021 will be equity statistics as we look to extract added insight. We want to expand the suite of statistics we use and /find indicators that provide insights, on both a lead and lag basis, to help close any remaining gaps - and prevent new ones.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n## Diversity\n\nWe aspire to an environment in which the aspects and dimensions of diversity re/flect the communities in which we operate.\n\nWe employ people on the basis of job requirements and do not discriminate on any grounds. We do not employ forced, bonded or child labour. We employ people with disabilities and make considerable efforts to offer suitable alternative employment and retraining to employees who become disabled and can no longer perform their regular duties.\n\nOur graduate programme continues to help us bring new perspectives into the organisation. This year, we increased our proportion of female graduates - by 6% - to 60%. In Australia, 8% of our graduate intake and 9% of our vacation student programme were Indigenous. We continued to offer scholarships, hire vacation students and graduates throughout the pandemic, leveraging virtual campus recruitment and development.\n\nThe overall percentage of female employees increased marginally - by 0.6% - to 19%. Our focus on women in leadership increased the proportion of women in senior management roles - by 3.5% - to 26.1%. We continue to focus on the representation of women across all levels and in all disciplines. For example, at our Pilbara iron ore operations, in Western Australia, this year we launched our 'Pathways to Mining' recruitment campaign, which aimed to recruit 100 women - including those without mining experience - for site-based operational roles and traineeships. The response to the campaign exceeded our expectations, attracting over 2,500 applications, which are currently being assessed for roles ranging from trade assistant to plant, laboratory, and drill and blast operator.\n\nAs noted earlier in this report, in 2021, we will expand our gender diversity targets beyond women in leadership to women at all levels. The dual challenge of increasing diversity and evolving our work environment to welcome diverse voices and perspectives will require signi/ficant and sustained effort across the organisation. To that end, we have also committed $50 million over /five years to advance Indigenous leadership in our business across Australia. And, as part of our ongoing commitment to our signatory Traditional Owner groups, we will continue to work on broader employment pathways, including entry level opportunities, career readiness programmes, school-to-work pathways, apprenticeships and other local employment programmes and activities. Our goal is to achieve a target of 8% Indigenous participation across our business in/uni00A0Australia.\n\nThe overall percentage of female employees increased by 0.6% to\n\n19%\n\n(7,713 women; 32,962 men)\n\nWomen in professional roles increased by/uni00A00.7% to\n\n26.5%\n\n(3,489 women; 9,659 men)\n\nExecutive Committee -/uni00A02021\n\n23%\n\n(3 women; 10 men)\n\n33.3% of Board roles\n\nheld by women (4 women; 8 men) increased from 11.1% in 2019\n\n26.1% of senior leadership roles held by women (132 women;\n\n373 men).\n\nWe de/fine senior leadership as general managers, Group advisers and chief advisers as well as employees in leadership roles who report directly to Executive Committee members\n\n## $50 million to attract, retain and support the development of Indigenous employees across Australia\n\nWe are:\n\n- -Changing our hiring practices by focusing on an Indigenous candidate's potential, not their mining experience.\n- -Introducing a cultural onboarding programme to ensure leaders have the skills they need to support Indigenous employees.\n- -Pairing Indigenous employees with senior leaders and providing career coaching for employees while also developing leaders' cultural competence.\n- -Supporting employees' growth and development by identifying skill gaps and working with each employee to create a career plan, including further education.\n- -Growing cultural competency through cultural awareness training, and where possible, cultural immersion opportunities on Country or through working directly with Indigenous businesses and organisations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A note on 2021 reporting\n\nFor 2021 reporting, the de/finition used to calculate diversity will be changed to include people not available for work due to extended leave for reasons such as parental leave and contractors (those/uni00A0engaged on temporary contracts to provide services under the direction of Rio Tinto leaders). This will mean our 2021 targets will be re-set to a slightly higher baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n## Human rights\n\nRespecting human rights is central to our values, and to the way we work - wherever we work. We believe respect for human rights starts with everyday actions. It is a responsibility we take seriously - from governance of our human rights-related policies, which are overseen by the Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, to processes like prescreening suppliers and providing human rights training to key employees.\n\nThis year, in the wake of Juukan Gorge, many stakeholders raised concerns about the implementation of our human rights commitments. The destruction of the rock shelters was a breach of our values, standards and procedures. The steps taken to address these matters are set out on pages 114-115.\n\nIn 2020, we strengthened controls to ensure that we continue to prevent our involvement in adverse human rights impacts and, importantly, that we also provide remediation when we have caused or contributed to human rights harm. Provisions in this regard include assurance and auditing of sites to ensure compliance with the human rights section of our Communities and Social Performance Standard, and Group-functionspeci/fic human rights training. They also require that each of our sites has a complaints, disputes and grievance mechanism in place, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights' (UNGPs) effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms.\n\nWe recognise the need to continually evolve our human rights performance and approach, and in 2021 we will focus, as part of a scheduled review of our human rights policy, on further embedding the policy and awareness of our salient human rights risks.\n\nWe also recognise the importance of addressing human rights risks in our business relationships, from our suppliers and customers to joint venture partners. We therefore look for ways to help our business partners respect human rights in line with international standards. At our non-managed operations, this may include best practice sharing around complaints handling, discussing human rights issues at joint management meetings and making our experts available to build capacity of operational employees.\n\nWe pre-screen potential business partners on human rights and require suppliers (including subcontractors) to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which necessitates respect for human rights. From 2019, our standard contractual terms have also required suppliers (including subcontractors) to take reasonable steps to prevent and address modern slavery in their supply chains, and granted us the right to audit our suppliers for compliance against these requirements. We also regularly report on modern slavery and other supply chain human rights/uni00A0themes.\n\nWe have identi/fied our salient human rights issues as operational security, labour rights, environmental impacts, the rights of Indigenous peoples, including cultural heritage, land/uni00A0access and resettlement and in-migration. Our salient human rights issues are those on which we could have the most severe impact on people through our operations or business relationships.\n\n## Adherence to international standards\n\nConsistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we are committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights, including acknowledging and respecting Indigenous peoples' connections to lands and waters. We voluntarily uphold a range of other international standards and guidelines, including the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global Compact. Our human rights performance is also assessed through various external initiatives, including the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, Copper Mark and the\n\nICMM. We reiterate our commitment to respect internationally recognised human rights aligned with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and to implement core international standards, including the UNGPs.\n\n## Key actions and achievements during 2020\n\n- -Progressing a remedy process with the PKKP people\n- -Engaging with human rights-related complaints in different fora, including the Australian National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises regarding the Panguna mine in Bougainville\n- -Providing support to our partner, the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e SA, in its participation in discussions with the International Finance Corporation's Of/fice of the Compliance Advisor and community complainants regarding the Sangaredi mine in Guinea\n- -IOC signed a Reconciliation and Collaboration Agreement with the Uashat mak Mani-utenam and Matimekush-Lac John communities and is currently negotiating an agreement with the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach\n- -Engaging openly with investors, civil society and community members in relation to a range of human rights issues to get feedback and improve our approach, including by convening roundtables in Australia and the UK with civil society organisations\n- -Publishing our third annual report on implementation of the VPSHR and our fourth modern slavery statement\n- -Commencing and progressing a labour rights supply chains risk assessment with a third-party provider to help us better target our labour rights risk/uni00A0management work in our supply chain, including in relation to modern slavery\n- -Raising awareness of modern slavery and other human rights issues among our global procurement team\n- -Progressing a new internal assurance process on human rights and on Communities and Social Performance with a focus on cultural heritage, grievance mechanisms and third-party due diligence\n- -Conducting VPSHR risk assessments, human rights training for security personnel and capacity building with business partners. This included delivering in-person training at our QIT Madagascar Minerals operation in March 2020, and sharing our VPSHR programme with a joint venture partner in South America\n- -Ranking third overall, and second within our sector, in the 2020 Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB). We note that the CHRB has appended a statement to our 2019 and 2020 results on recent events concerning Juukan Gorge",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nIn a world dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, societal expectations on climate action remain high. Addressing them will, today more than ever, require businesses, governments and society to work together.\n\nWe divested the last of our coal businesses in 2018 and no longer extract fossil fuels. Our ambition is to reach net zero emissions across our operations by 2050. This year, with a strong focus on execution, we have also articulated a more explicit link between executive remuneration and our climate change targets: to reduce our absolute emissions by 15% by 2030 and emissions intensity by 30% (relative to our 2018 equity baseline). These targets were informed by a comprehensive analysis of abatement opportunities across the Group and supported by our commitment to spend approximately $1 billion on emissions reduction initiatives over a /five-year period, starting in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, we started the transition to renewable energy in the Pilbara, in Western Australia, with the approval of the $98 million, 34MW solar plant at Gudai-Darri and 45MW battery system at Tom Price. Today, 75% of electricity used at our managed operations is from renewable sources. Of/uni00A0the $1 billion we committed to climate-related projects over /five years, in 2020, we approved spend of more than $140 million.\n\nSince 2018, we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 1.1Mt CO 2 e, or 3%, which is on track with our 2030 target for absolute emissions. However, in 2020, our emissions remained at the same level as in 2019 at 31.5Mt CO 2 e. We expect progress on emissions to accelerate later in our 2030 target period as we develop and implement our mitigation projects, studies and research and development.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur climate change strategy is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement; climate change considerations are integrated with our strategic and operational decision making and our approach is supported by strong governance and continual strengthening of processes and capabilities. Our third climate change report is available on our website and details progress against the four pillars of our approach:\n\n- 1.  Produce materials essential for a low-carbon future\n- 2.  Reduce the carbon footprint of our operations\n- 3.  Partner to reduce the carbon footprint across our value chains\n- 4.  Enhance our resilience to physical climate risks\n\nClimate risks and opportunities have been part of our strategic thinking, including on capital allocation, for more than two decades. We test our portfolio against a range of integrated strategic scenarios, each capturing alternative climate change narratives. Our most recent analysis, conducted in 2020, indicates the diversity of our portfolio strengthens our resilience, including in a scenario aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nMost of our assets already sit at the low end of their respective commodity carbon intensity curves and our 2030 targets are aligned with a 45% reduction in absolute emissions from 2010 levels, which is consistent with 1.5\u00b0C pathways described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nOver the past year, we have further developed our asset-by-asset decarbonisation roadmaps and started work on mitigation projects, with a particular focus on renewables, process heat and ways to replace diesel fuel in our mobile /fleets and rail networks. These roadmaps and actions are owned by our product groups and fully integrated into our annual business\n\nplanning process, with support and co-ordination from our Energy and Climate Change Centre of Excellence. In 2020, we progressed partnerships essential to executing our abatement projects and we continued to develop technology solutions to meet our mid- to long-term ambitions.\n\n## Partnerships and Scope 3 goals and targets\n\nIn late 2020, China, Japan and South Korea joined the European Union to set carbon neutrality ambitions within a 2050-60 timeframe. Together, these countries account for more than 70% of our sales and around 90% of our value chain emissions (Scope 3) from our key products, including iron ore and aluminium. We have updated our approach to calculating Scope 3 emissions which are estimated to be 519 Mt CO 2 e in 2020.\n\nWe continue to explore collective solutions to reduce emissions across our value chain. This year, we de/fined a series of measurable Scope 3 emissions reduction goals to guide our partnership approach.\n\nWith about 80% of our Scope 3 emissions coming from customers' hard-to-abate processes, our Scope 3 goals are focused mostly on our contribution to the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. These include targets related to emissions from shipping our products. Our Scope 3 goals are to:\n\n- -Work with customers on steel decarbonisation pathways and invest in technologies that could deliver reductions in steelmaking carbon intensity of at least 30% from 2030.\n- -Work in partnership to develop breakthrough technologies with the potential to deliver carbon neutral steelmaking pathways by 2050.\n- -Continue to scale up the ELYSIS TM breakthrough technology enabling the production of zero-carbon aluminium.\n- -Meet our ambition to reach net zero emissions from shipping our products by 2050.\n\nIn many important applications, there are no low-carbon alternatives to steel, aluminium and copper. Furthermore, these materials will enable the low-carbon transition. The challenge is to produce them sustainably - not only with lower emissions, but also in a way that respects communities.\n\n## Disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations\n\nIn 2018, we welcomed the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in our /first climate change report and have aligned our climate change disclosures to be more transparent. Climate-related disclosures on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets are also integrated into this Annual Report in the following sections: strategic context, key performance indicators, risk management, principal risks and uncertainties, governance, Sustainability Committee report and remuneration.\n\nOur climate change report provides a more thorough and consolidated review of our climate change strategy, our approach to evaluating and managing climate-related risks and progress towards our targets. Our 2020 Sustainability Fact Book includes a full list of the TCFD recommendations alongside references to our disclosure against them. We see ongoing development of good practice on climate-related disclosures in our sector and beyond, in part as a result of an iterative process of feedback from stakeholders. We anticipate, therefore, continuing to progress along the TCFD 'implementation path' and further enhancing our climate reporting in years to come.",

Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions or greenhouse gases generated as a result of activities undertaken across our value chain, either upstream or downstream of our operations.\n\n(a)  The 2018 /figure is the baseline for our 2030 emissions target and has been adjusted to exclude emissions from assets divested in that year.

From the Gobi Desert in Mongolia to the Arctic environment of our Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada, we use water to access and process ore, manage dust and promote rehabilitation. At some sites, most notably at our aluminium operations, we also use water to produce hydropower.\n\nWe take a catchment-level approach to water management at each site, meaning that we manage our impacts, risks and potential solutions not only within our operations but with the understanding that we share water with host and downstream communities and ecosystems. We consider the catchment landscape and local communities' needs. We also consider the impact of dewatering on nearby communities and the environment now and over the long term, including beyond the life of our/uni00A0operations.\n\nWe aim to avoid permanent impacts to water resources like lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, and carefully manage the quality and quantity of the water we use and return to the environment. We also strive to balance our operational needs with those of local communities, First Nations and Traditional Owners, and local ecosystems. And we consider the impact of climate change, which is already affecting rainfall and water security at many of our sites. This requires a proactive, collaborative approach with a broad range of local stakeholders, including domestic water users and other industries.\n\nWe aim to use water as ef/ficiently as possible in the design and operation of our sites, and our risk assessment process is fundamental to this. We consider water risk against the following four themes:\n\n- 1.  Water resource - is there suf/ficient water for operational and broader catchment needs?\n- 2.  Quantity/quality - does site water inventory or its management cause operational constraints or environmental impacts?\n- 3.  Dewatering - do dewatering or depressurisation activities impact the mine plan or regional aquifers?\n- 4.  Long-term obligations - do our activities generate long-term or ongoing obligations?\n\nWe use this framework to identify, assess, manage and communicate water risk - both internally and to the communities where we operate.\n\nWe provide our Group water risk pro/file below. This provides an indication of the distribution of water risk across our portfolio. While we have sites that sit in the 'very high' and 'high' categories for each of the risks - and appropriately rigorous standards, processes and capabilities to effectively manage them - the majority of our portfolio sits in the 'low' to 'moderate' range. We apply the same approach across our entire portfolio.\n\n## Group water risk pro/file (% of managed operations) (a)\n\n## Water resources\n\n## Quantity and quality\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are a range of water risks, not just water scarcity, so we have set targets - tailored to the speci/fic challenges at each site - and publicly report on progress against each one. This year, we are also providing further detail on our website through asset-level disclosures, which show key water risks at each site.\n\n## Our 2019-23 water targets\n\nLast year, we set new water targets that allow us to be more transparent about our water usage, risk pro/file, management and challenges. These targets, and the data required to measure progress against them, will help us become better water stewards today and for future generations - whether in water-scarce regions or where water is plentiful. They will also help us improve our performance over the next /five years.\n\nOur water targets consist of one Group target and six site-based targets; the site targets were chosen based on their water risk pro/file, our ICMM commitments, and local community and environmental interdependencies.\n\nThis year, we continued to progress against our Group target and remain on track to meet it by 2023. We have collected water allocation volume data for all our assets in Australia and will complete this for our remaining operations during 2021. We will also focus on estimating surface water catchment rainfall runoff volumes for our managed operations.\n\n## Water - performance data 2016-2020 (in GL)\n\n| Withdrawals (by source)                | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Surface water                          | 315    | 326    | 272    | 348    | 346    |\n| Groundwater                            | 312    | 296    | 321    | 304    | 293    |\n| Marine                                 | 71     | 70     | 48     | 109    | 79     |\n| Municipal                              | 34     | 24     | 31     | 30     | 36     |\n| Third party                            | 29     | 38     | 36     | 34     | 34     |\n| Entrained in ore                       | 398    | 471    | 485    | 369    | 467    |\n| Total                                  | 1,159  | 1,225  | 1,193  | 1,193  | 1,255  |\n| Withdrawals (by quality)               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n| Type 1                                 | 457    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Type 2                                 | 240    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Type 3                                 | 462    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Fresh                                  | -      | 562    | 539    | 584    | 573    |\n| Other                                  | -      | 664    | 654    | 609    | 682    |\n| Total                                  | 1,159  | 1,225  | 1,193  | 1,193  | 1,255  |\n| Discharges (by destination)            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n| Surface water                          | 327    | 330    | 314    | 275    | 247    |\n| Groundwater and seepage                | 129    | 115    | 127    | 160    | 148    |\n| Marine                                 | 146    | 93     | 63     | 133    | 99     |\n| Third party                            | 34     | 35     | 30     | 26     | 37     |\n| Total                                  | 636    | 573    | 533    | 594    | 531    |\n| Discharges (by quality)                | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n| Type 1                                 | 290    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Type 2                                 | 127    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Type 3                                 | 218    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Fresh                                  | -      | 376    | 362    | 351    | 331    |\n| Other                                  | -      | 197    | 171    | 243    | 199    |\n| Total                                  | 636    | 573    | 533    | 594    | 531    |\n| Consumption                            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n| Evaporation & other losses             | 438    | 575    | 650    | 523    | 640    |\n| Entrained in product and process waste | 86     | 83     | 85     | 85     | 85     |\n| Total                                  | 524    | 657    | 734    | 609    |        |\n| Recycled/reused                        | 2020   |        |        |        | 725    |\n| Total                                  |        | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|                                        | 335    | 331    | 296    | 304    | 282    |\n\nWater quality type categories correlate with reporting requirements for the International Council of Mining & Metals (ICMM), Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

        "page_content": "## Biodiversity\n\nWe are acutely aware of the interconnected challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, and the signi/ficant risks these have for the environment, wildlife and humanity as a whole. We recognise our operations inherently pose a risk to biodiversity, as well as to the communities that rely on the environment - directly and indirectly - for their lives and livelihoods. Our aim is to avoid such harm when possible and mitigate it when we cannot avoid it.\n\nProtecting biodiversity, therefore, is an important part of our commitment to communities and our employees, as well as to the environment. We are committed to minimising our risks and impacts to biodiversity through the application of the mitigation hierarchy, with the ambition of achieving no net loss to biodiversity at our assets. 'No net loss' means striking a balance between negative impacts on biodiversity and positive outcomes through mitigation.\n\nTo that end, we have been engaging with several external programmes to develop both our roadmap for disclosure and target-setting approach for biodiversity and land. For example, in 2020, we joined the Informal Working Group on the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, which will help steer business towards positive outcomes for nature.\n\nThis year, to further sharpen our biodiversity management processes, we assessed all of our managed operations using an approach developed in 2019 by experts from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). Using this methodology - combined with global biodiversity datasets of threatened species and\n\nconservation and protected areas - we prioritised our operations based on their biodiversity sensitivity. Twenty-eight managed operations were identi/fied as being within a /five kilometre radius of a Protected Area; we con/firmed 12 high-priority sites.\n\nAlso in 2020, we assessed the implementation of our biodiversity protection and natural resources management standard across all of our operations. The review indicated that the completion of risk assessments for biodiversity features, development of action plans and monitoring programmes across our operations is tracking well (see /figure one). In/uni00A02021, we will focus on ensuring all priority sites have their monitoring programme independently reviewed - another key requirement of the/uni00A0standard.\n\nAssurance processes such as these allow us to identify good practices for replication across the business, while also ensuring assets receive the right support and expertise to match their level of risk.\n\n## Our biodiversity standard implementation status across all Rio Tinto sites\n\n## Our biodiversity standard implementation status across Rio Tinto high-priority biodiversity sites\n\nFigure one summarises the implementation of key components of the biodiversity protection and natural resources management standard for all managed sites with a focus on the high-priority sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYes",

        "page_content": "## Strategic Report\n\n## Sustainability continued\n\n## Closure\n\nWe recognise our impact and responsibility do not end when our operations cease, so we consider closure in the way we design, build and run every site.\n\nWe seek to create a consensus with stakeholders on a shared vision for the land, balancing environmental and community considerations with long-term capital implications associated with water treatment, repurposing and/or remediating land. Our goal is to leave a positive legacy, delivering value for the Group and our stakeholders.\n\nWe have 92 active legacy assets around the world. At the end of 2020, closure provisions on our balance sheet totalled $13.3 billion (compared with $11.1 billion in 2019). This year, we have provided more detail on our /financial liabilities related to closure - please see page 244.\n\nOver the next /five years, we will transition a number of assets into closure and to their next use. Our Argyle diamond mine, in Western Australia, ceased production in 2020 after nearly 40 years of operation. Following closure, the land will be returned to the Traditional Owners as the custodians of Country, for activities such as cattle grazing, tourism, cultural use and possibly small-scale agriculture and native food production. We target 14% of our closure budget to be spent with Traditional Owners and local providers.\n\nWe are also supporting our Argyle employees' transition to new career opportunities, either within Rio Tinto or externally, based on their personal goals and preferences. We began a structured career coaching programme in 2017 to ensure people were well prepared for the mine's closure, which included providing formal training - of their choice - to all employees. To date, we have found new roles for 90% of Argyle employees who wanted to be redeployed within our company.\n\nThe Ranger uranium mine, operated by ERA, in the Northern Territory, Australia, ceased production in early 2021. Progressive closure of the mine is continuing; Pit 1 has been /filled and is currently being revegetated and Pit 3 is being /filled. ERA is tracking towards 2026 for the completion of closure work.\n\nWhile mining continues at our Gove bauxite operations, also in the Northern Territory, we have begun progressive closure activities, including the decommissioning and demolition of the re/finery. We are also planning for the next stage of closure by doing things like upgrading the water treatment plant. We expect our mining operations at Gove to cease in 2030.\n\n## Strengthening our approach\n\nOur work supporting operating assets has also expanded and between 2018-20 we completed 14 asset closure strategies, covering 35% of our assets. These create a progressive vision for future land use after our operations cease and help ensure closure is considered throughout the asset lifecycle. All of our operating assets have tactical closure plans in place, aligned with our closure framework. We regularly review and update these plans to ensure they re/flect stakeholder expectations and seek to improve our closure practices as we learn from them. At operations with joint ownership structures, we work in partnership with other asset owners to embed closure into asset design, planning and operations.\n\nWe continue to engage stakeholders of our sites nearing closure including Indigenous peoples, government, employees and host communities - via engagements and partnerships, which in turn helps them plan their future. For example, collaboration with the local community and regulators at Mount Rosser, Jamaica, led to successful revegetation of this former bauxite mine, a legacy site, which now supports local employment and is also home to an increasing number of wildlife.\n\nOur approach to supporting regional economic development includes a strong focus on economic diversi/fication. We endeavour to foster wider economic activities alongside national and local governments and community development plans. This re/flects our commitment to sustainability as well as our aim to have communities thrive long after our operations cease.\n\nAccordingly, we look for commercial opportunities to repurpose assets to reduce the social and economic impact of closure. At a number of our former assets, we are exploring options to repurpose the site for renewable energy, such as our pilot photovoltaic cell facility at Marignac, France, a former ferro alloy plant. At times, we partner with universities and other companies to /find opportunities to repurpose and reprocess waste and improve water and waste treatment. For example, in the Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada, we worked with local blueberry growers to create a safe and effective fertiliser made from waste created by our aluminium operations.\n\nFor more information on closure provisions and /financial statements, refer to page 244 of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Integrity is one of the /five core values de/fined in The Way We Work : the courage and commitment to do what is right, not what is easy.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nThe Way We Work makes it clear that we do not offer, pay or accept bribes, no matter where we operate, no matter what the situation, and no matter who is involved. This position is further supported by our business integrity standard and procedure, which require employees, core contractors and associated persons acting for, or on behalf, of the company to not commit, authorise or be involved in bribery, corruption, fraud or other economic crimes. We also provide clear rules regarding third-party bene/fits, managing con/flicts of interest, facilitation payment, sponsorships, donations and community support, mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, and engaging third parties. We continue to co-operate fully with relevant authorities in connection with their investigations in relation to contractual payments of $10.5 million made to a consultant who provided advisory services in 2011 on the Simandou project in Guinea. Please refer to the Contingent Liabilities on page 261 for further information.\n\nOur business integrity compliance programme, which is managed independently of our business's operations, is designed to manage our compliance risks and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where we conduct our business.\n\nIn 2020, we established a new risk and monitoring forum to monitor the management of Group-level business integrity risks and ensure our key internal compliance controls are effective.\n\nWe also engaged external experts and /finalised maturity assessments of our data privacy and business integrity compliance programmes. We rated well overall, but there are always opportunities to improve; we are implementing actions as needed.\n\nIn 2020, we expanded our business integrity standard and procedure to strengthen controls in areas such as terrorist /financing and anti-money laundering, as well as reducing declaration thresholds for giving and receiving bene/fits and making sponsorships and donations. We also enhanced controls to manage third-party business integrity risks by improving our due diligence and monitoring processes, adding more controls for high-risk, third-party engagements and payments and providing training for third parties, where needed.\n\nEmployees are required to complete annual online compliance training, tailored to suit the risks employees are most likely to encounter in their roles. This year, we also provided additional risk-based training to 4,410 employees and contractors in 23 countries, and launched enhanced business integrity training online, covering integrity-driven decision making, anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering and fraud for higher risk roles. In 2020, we also developed our ethics ambassadors programme to extend the sharing and reach of integrity insights and champion an integrity-driven culture across the business.\n\nFinally, in response to COVID-19, we conducted a Group-level risk assessment and implemented monitoring and due diligence activities, such as supporting compliance reviews of community preparedness and recovery donation proposals.\n\n## Whistleblower programme\n\nA key change this year was to establish the Business Conduct Of/fice, a/uni00A0dedicated team responsible for the management of the whistleblower/uni00A0programme.\n\nIn 2020, we reviewed 748 incidents reported through whistleblower programme channels, 42% of which were substantiated.

We/uni00A0continue to report in increasing detail on taxes and royalties paid and economic contribution. We are a founding member of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and have actively supported EITI's principles and global transparency and accountability standard since 2003.\n\nIn 2020, for the /first time, we released comprehensive /financial and tax disclosures for 2018 for each country where we operate, through our 2018 Country by Country Report. In 2021, we will make additional disclosures, thereby fully implementing the requirements of the tax and payments to governments standard of the Global Sustainability Standards Board of the Global Reporting Initiative.\n\nWe also disclosed additional mineral development contracts with governments, where they are not subject to con/fidentiality restrictions, thus meeting the commitments we made in our Transparency Statement, available on our website. We continue to encourage governments to allow such disclosures. We also continued to disclose information about the bene/ficial owners of our joint ventures in line with EITI standards and expectations.\n\n## Political integrity\n\nAs a company, we do not favour any political party, group or individual, or involve ourselves in party political matters. We do not contribute to political parties or candidates.\n\nOur business integrity standard and procedure includes strict guidelines for dealing with current and former government of/ficials and politicians, including that they cannot be appointed to company positions or engaged as consultants, in certain circumstances, without approval of executive leadership and the Chief Ethics & Compliance Of/ficer.\n\nWe engage in public policy on issues that affect or could affect our business, including by contributing relevant information and sharing experiences that help create viable outcomes. For example, we provided submissions to the Government of Western Australia and engaged in the broader public consultation process to facilitate the repeal and replacement of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 with a modernised act re/flective of current practice and expectations.\n\nWe join industry associations where membership provides value to our business, investors and other stakeholders.

The Committee reviews the effectiveness of management policies and procedures relating to safety, health, employment practices, relationships with neighbouring communities, environment, human rights, land access, political involvement and sustainable development. For more about our Sustainability Committee, including the terms of reference, see the Governance section of this report.\n\nWe complete a sustainability materiality assessment every year to ensure we are publicly reporting on topics that matter most to our stakeholders and to our business. In simple terms, a sustainability materiality assessment records the threshold at which an issue or topic becomes important enough to be reported on externally. This considers the impact and level of perceived importance to stakeholders. This differs from /financial materiality, which may use /financial metrics or other quantitative analyses to determine what would be considered a signi/ficant, or material, impact. Not all sustainability-related topics have the same risk pro/file, which the assessment re/flects.\n\nLast year, we altered the approach to our sustainability materiality assessment. We used various sources of direct input from external engagement to strengthen our understanding of what is important to stakeholders. This revised approach combined the views of our external stakeholders with those of our internal subject matter experts (SMEs) through a quantitative and qualitative assessment.\n\nThis year, we engaged an independent external assurance organisation, KPMG, to provide the directors of Rio Tinto with assurance on selected sustainability subject matters. In 2019 and years prior, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided this independent external assurance.

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\nTaking and managing risk responsibly is essential to running our business safely, effectively and in a way that creates value for our customers and shareholders, employees and partners.\n\nEffectively managing our risks ensures we meet our strategic objectives, mitigate threats and create opportunities in alignment with our values - Safety, Teamwork, Respect, Integrity and Excellence.\n\n## Our approach\n\nEffective risk management is necessary to manage both threats and opportunities to our strategy and operations. Our risk management process helps us identify, evaluate, plan, communicate, and manage material risks that have the potential to impact our business objectives. While risk management is a key accountability and performance criteria for our leaders, all employees have a responsibility for identifying and managing risks. Our Board and Executive Risk Management Committee provide oversight of our principal risks and associated management responses described on pages 95-105. The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls. Our risk management system is made up of six core elements (see page 93) - one of which is our risk management framework, which sets out clear roles and responsibilities, standards and procedures. We also have three lines of defence to verify that risks are being effectively managed in line with our policy, standards and procedures, including across core business processes such as /finance, health and safety, social performance, environment and major hazards. You can view our risk management standard at www.riotinto.com.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of the risk management framework requires clear expectations and consistency of application of the framework, across different product groups and businesses, countries of operation and functional areas of expertise.\n\nThis clearly did not happen in the case of the events leading to the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. Following the events at Juukan Gorge, we have made changes to cultural heritage risk management within that framework. These changes strengthen the /first and second lines of defence, establishing a Communities and Social Performance Area of Expertise to deliver a more rigorous assurance framework with regard to the way we manage host communities and cultural heritage risks across our operations globally. The tragedy of Juukan Gorge highlights the critical dependency on risks being identi/fied and then monitored on an ongoing basis by operational management (within the /first line of defence). From there, if circumstances change, the risk needs to be escalated quickly and appropriately to senior leaders and the relevant functional experts within the second line. The second and\n\nthird lines also need to be suf/ficiently well connected to identify the true nature of the underlying risk and how this may then be symptomatic or thematic for other assets or jurisdictions within the Group.\n\nOf course, all of this system of risk management and internal control is predicated upon a culture that recognises and prioritises cultural heritage speci/fically, and more generally supports the timely and effective communication and escalation of risk. Fundamentally, risk frameworks are only ever as good as the information that /flows through them, and the experience and judgment of individuals in key positions. This is particularly important in a group that is of our size, scale and complexity.\n\nThe Board, Audit Committee and our business and functional management teams are all determined to play a part in making these improvements to the overall culture and systems of risk management and internal control to ensure that the lessons learned from Juukan Gorge are applied to other risk areas, particularly other environmental and social risks.\n\nEvery part of our risk management framework is there to challenge and evaluate the status of our risk pro/file in the pursuit of our business objectives. The way we challenge the status is by having three lines of defence that support leaders in critically reviewing and validating their own operating assumptions.\n\n| Three lines of defence                                         | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                | Accountability of          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 1 st  - All operational leaders                                | Identi/fication, management, veri/fication and monitoring of risks and controls                                                                 | Management                 |\n| 2 nd  - Centre of Excellence and            Areas of Expertise | Oversees risks, control effectiveness, advice on capability and ensures objective  assurance against Group's policies, standards and procedures | Management                 |\n| 3 rd  - Group Internal Audit                                   | Provides independent veri/fication that risks and internal controls are being  managed effectively                                              | Board and Board committees |",

We track leading indicators of emerging risks and their likely impact on our long-term prospects. We proactively analyse the impact of these risks on our business model through plausible scenarios of the interplay between geopolitics, societal expectations and technology advancement.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional uncertainty globally and the recovery pathway remains unclear. Our agility and resilience has enabled us to continue to operate, deliver products to our customers and contribute to economies and communities. Since early 2020, we have activated business resilience teams across our global operations, introduced strict health measures to protect our employees and communities, and adapted our systems to support a signi/ficant number of employees working from home. We continue to closely monitor the potential short-to-long-term impacts on our business. This includes impacts on our employees, supply chain, market demand and trade, as well as the resilience of global /financial markets to support an economy recovery.\n\nEmerging risks by nature are highly uncertain, with scope for rapid or non-linear evolution. The main categories of emerging risks that we monitor continuously, and that could potentially have an impact (positive or negative) on the Group are described below:\n\nTrade tensions: Trade is an essential part of our business, and the mining sector in general, as the majority of our products cross national borders. Throughout the year, we have seen the dynamics of geopolitics causing volatile market conditions including the introduction of tariffs on various goods between China and the US, tariffs on Canadian aluminium imports to the US, a targeted reduction on imports from Australia by China and tightening of foreign investment laws in Australia and Canada. Although we have not been signi/ficantly affected by these dynamics to date, we monitor these trends closely, and in particular the evolution of the relationship between Australia and China.\n\nIncreasing societal and investor expectations: In 2020, we continued to see increasing expectations and focus on social equality, fairness and sustainability - and how companies address these issues. Financial institutions are also placing greater emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations when making investment decisions. The increasing focus on ESG has the potential to shape the future of the mining industry, supply cost structures, demand for global commodities and capital markets. While this presents us with opportunities for portfolio and product differentiation, it has the potential to impact how we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management framework\n\n- -Group's roles and responsibilities, standards, procedures and guiding principles for effective, consistent and integrated risk management.\n\n## Risk analysis and management\n\n- -Risks are measured, monitored and managed, which requires that critical controls performance is also being measured, monitored and managed\n- -Risks and their control information are current, transparent and connected\n- -Leader-led analysis and management.\n\n## Reporting oversight and insights\n\n- -Management's oversight is supported by proactive reporting and effective escalation\n- -Decision-making is supported by connected and insightful risk analysis.\n\nHost communities and cultural heritage: We are committed to strengthening our relationships with host communities, including Traditional Owners and First Nations and improving the way we manage cultural heritage. We have taken a number of actions to address the lessons learned from Juukan Gorge, including establishing a standalone Communities and Social Performance (CSP) Area of Expertise, which will deliver more rigorous assurance across our operations and elevate communities risk processes. We have also set up an Integrated Heritage Management Plan with strict approval protocols at both the product group and Group levels. We include more detail about the actions we are taking in response to Juukan Gorge on 114-115.\n\nResource depletion: The continual replenishment of economically viable resources is essential for our future growth. Our past divestments, planned closures and uncertainty over resource assumptions - without reciprocal resource replenishment through exploration or acquisitions could impact our growth options. Additionally, our ability to access resources could potentially be impacted as regulations evolve.\n\nTransition to a low-carbon future: Climate change constitutes an important part of our sustainability approach. Climate change risks have formed part of our strategic thinking and investment decisions for over two decades. The transition to a low-carbon future presents both challenges and opportunities for our portfolio over the short to long term. Key areas of uncertainty include future climate change regulation and policies, the development of low-carbon technology solutions and the pace of transition across our value chains, in particular the decarbonisation pathways across the steel sector.\n\nWe are targeting a 15% reduction in absolute emissions from 2018 levels by 2030, with an ambition to reach net zero emissions by 2050 across our operations. Overall, our growth between now and 2030 will be carbon neutral. We continue to enhance our monitoring and management of greenhouse gas emissions, water and land use, and rehabilitation.\n\nWe are also actively engaging in partnerships to explore ways to improve environmental performance across our value chains, such as with China Baowu Steel Group, Tsinghua University and Nippon Steel Corporation in the steel sector, and the ELYSIS TM joint venture in the aluminium sector. We are also active participants in the International Council on Mining and Metals and the Climate-Smart Mining initiative.

Demand for our commodities could shift to 'greener' alternatives, with a higher dependence on recycling, ie secondary supply. Alternatively, an increased focus on ensuring supply security could see large volumes of supply enter the market, potentially impacting future margins.\n\nTechnology advancement: Technological advances bring both opportunities and threats for our business. Digital connectivity has enabled us to conduct essential activities, including assurance work, at remote sites where travel has been restricted due to COVID-19. Technology will also be a key enabler to reaching our net zero emissions ambition, through initiatives such as decarbonising the electricity network at our Pilbara iron ore operations in Western Australia and the ELYSIS TM carbon-free aluminium smelting process. However, cyber attacks are becoming more prevalent and we have had to invest signi/ficantly in technology to enhance our cyber security.\n\n## Longer-term viability statement\n\nAs discussed above, we closely monitor and assess the impact of key emerging risks on our long-term prospects and, where possible, proactively build response plans into our investment decisions.\n\nOur long-term planning re/flects our business model of running our business in ways that are safer, smarter and more sustainable. To ensure we remain resilient in the long term, our business model is continuously stress tested against the key uncertainties within the emerging risks, with recommended actions to mitigate potential downside. These are presented to the Board on an annual basis as part of the Group strategy discussions. We then develop our strategy and make capital investment decisions based on this assessment. We also regularly assess our /financial investment capacity to ensure our capital commitments can be funded in line with our disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nOur business planning processes include preparing a one-year detailed /financial plan and a longer-term life-of-asset outlook. This planning process includes modelling a series of macroeconomic scenarios and using a range of assumptions that consider both internal and external factors. As part of our robust risk management framework, we closely track, monitor and mitigate principal risks to our business plan and model.\n\nThe key assumptions underpinning our long-term plan include:\n\n- -long-term economic growth and commodity demand in major markets, such as China;\n- -continued access to and economic viability of resources and reserves to support organic and inorganic growth programmes;\n- -pathways to reduce carbon footprint;\n- -no signi/ficant industry-wide disruptive technology or productivity enhancement that unlock very low cost supply; and\n- -no operational risks materially impacting the long-term plan.\n\nOur business plan and macroeconomic forecast has its greatest level of certainty in the underlying assumptions in its /first three years. However, our longer-term viability assessment examines the /first /five years (2021-25) of the business plan. This not only enables a detailed analysis of potential impact of risks materialising in quick succession in the /first three years but also enables us to further stress test the business plan for risk materialising towards the end of the time period, although with lesser certainty. This allows directors to assess our capacity to exercise /financial levers available in both the three-year and /five-year time frame to maintain the Group's viability.\n\nThe principal risks and uncertainties included in our longer-term viability assessment are as follows:\n\n- -Economic risk: A global /financial crisis triggered as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and global tensions intensify that lead to positive but low growth in China and an economic downturn in the rest of the world. Large negative pricing shocks are assumed in 2021, followed by persistent slow growth rates.\n- -Operational risk: A 'one-off' catastrophic event resulting from a major operational failure, such as a tailings and water storage facility failure, extreme weather event, underground or geotechnical event resulting in multiple fatalities, cessation of operations and signi/ficant /financial impacts.\n\nWe quantify the expected /financial impact of each risk based on internal macroeconomic and business analysis, as well as internal and external benchmarking on similar risks. We apply a probabilistic approach to quantify risks and impacts where relevant. Although the likelihood of more than one principal risk materialising in close succession is unlikely, the stress test assumes these risks could materialise individually and in multiple combinations to create severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the Group's viability.\n\nApplying these scenarios, the /first /five years of the Group's business plan is stress tested to assess the impact on the Group's longer-term viability, including whether additional /financing facilities will be required. In addition to liquidity and solvency, the assessment also considers other /financial performance metrics such as cash /flow, debt capacity and credit rating, as well as dividend payments. These metrics are subject to robust stress tests and reverse stress tests.\n\nTaken in isolation, each risk does not threaten the viability of our business model. The main impact from each risk is a signi/ficant decrease in our free cash /flow and subsequent reduction in the dividend. We have levers in place to maintain adequate levels of liquidity, including reducing discretionary capital expenditure and accessing lines of credit.\n\nThe most 'severe' scenario, albeit unlikely, considers the /financial impact of both economic and operational risks materialising in a single year at the start of the assessment period, followed by a second operational risk occurring towards the end of the /five-year time period. This scenario would create both an immediate and prolonged severe impact, followed by a second impact on the Group's /financial performance towards the end of the period of assessment with an estimated negative free cash /flow of $11 billion. The Group has a suite of management actions available to preserve resilience, including accessing lines of credit, reducing capital expenditure and raising debt while maintaining the shareholder return policy. Our /financial /flexibility could potentially be limited during the peak of the crisis. The viability of the Group under all the severe but plausible scenarios tested remained sound.\n\nAlthough we have made signi/ficant efforts to predict global recovery pathways from the COVID-19 pandemic, there still remains large uncertainty on how the situation will develop and how far reaching the impact will be. We have assumed a 'severe' recovery pathway to mitigate some of this uncertainty and give a greater level of con/fidence to the directors in assessing our long-term viability.\n\nTherefore, taking into account the Group's current position and the robust assessment of our principal risks, the directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over the next /five years (until 31 December 2025) and have a reasonable expectation that we will be able to continue to operate and meet our liabilities as they fall due over that period.",

A principal risk is one or a combination of risks that can manifest externally or internally, be of any nature, and escalate from any area of the business. As such, we set expectations that all our leaders and team members understand their risks, assess them in line with Group policies and procedures, and respond. Where risks are material to the Group, they are escalated to the Executive Risk Management Committee and, as appropriate, to the Board or its committees. This requires a strong risk culture that we continue to develop and foster.\n\nThe principal risks, uncertainties and trends outlined in this report should be considered as forward-looking statements and are made subject to the cautionary statement on page 384.

New ore resources\n\nThe success of exploration programmes and/or acquisitions may be insuf/ficient to offset depletion.\n\n## Management response\n\nWe have grouped the reporting lines of our Exploration, Mergers and Acquisitions and Group Strategy teams under one Executive Committee member to better leverage our collective knowledge of opportunities. This enhances our ability to:\n\n- -Continually review opportunities in the exploration and acquisitions portfolios and prioritise accordingly.\n- -Leverage and develop new technologies for exploration and evaluation of reserves/resources.\n- -Create and maintain third-party partnerships to grow our/uni00A0portfolio.\n\n## 6. Strategic partnerships\n\nStrategic partnerships play a material role in delivering our growth, production, cash or market positioning, and these may not always develop as planned. Strategic partnerships include our Traditional Owners, customers, joint ventures partners (managed and non-managed), governments and our suppliers.\n\n## Management response\n\nWe approach investments and partnerships with a view to long-term development of relationships rather than short-term transactional advantage. To support that we:\n\n- -Actively participate within the governance structures of joint ventures to promote, where possible, alignment with the Group's policies and strategic priorities.\n- -Modernise our agreements with Traditional Owners, which includes modifying clauses to ensure respect, transparency and mutual bene/fit.\n- -Engage in partnerships to explore ways to improve environmental performance across our value chains, such as with China Baowu Steel Group and Tsinghua University and the ELYSIS.\n\nIn addition, our code of conduct, The Way We Work , provides clear guidance on how we should conduct our business, no matter where we work or where we are from.\n\nStrategic ESG\n\n## Opportunities\n\nExploration and/or acquisitions have the potential to increase resources in commodities currently within our portfolio or diversify into new commodities. We focus our activity on our highest-value projects, particularly on evaluating the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, US, and advancing our Winu copper/gold deposit in Australia. When determining targets, we consider our customers' and society's needs for new products and design our strategy to maximise opportunities.\n\n## Threats\n\nRecent assessment indicates a net decrease in our resources and reserves across all commodities. New large, long-life deposits are increasingly scarce and those that are known require advances in processing technology and/or signi/ficant capital investment in infrastructure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\n## Trend\n\nStrategic partnerships offer opportunities to create mutual bene/fits for all parties involved by leveraging the differing strengths of the participants. This may be realised through increased community participation in employment and procurement opportunities, access to resources, increased shareholder returns, or reduced political, portfolio and operational risks. Where we partner in operations, we seek to bring a commensurate level of rigour and discipline to our managed and non-managed joint ventures as we do to our wholly-owned assets, through engagement and in/fluence and in line with applicable laws.\n\n## Threats\n\nDisruption to our partnerships may limit the expected bene/fits received by participants and lead to interruptions to our operations, development projects and exploration activities. For non-managed operations, the decisions of the controlling partners may cause adverse impacts to the value of our interest in the operation, or to our reputation, and may expose us to unexpected liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Potential impact\n\n- -Group reputation\n- -Future /financial and operational performance\n- -Valuation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Potential impact\n\n- -Valuation\n- -Future /financial and operational performance\n- -Group reputation",

The volume of material reported in Resource and Reserve is based on the geological, commercial and technical information available at the date of the report and is, by its nature, incomplete. As new information comes to light, the economic viability of some Ore Reserves and mine plans may be reassessed with material impacts (positive or negative).\n\n## Management response\n\nWe invest in developing our orebody knowledge to inform our company's organic growth pathways and projections of /financial performance. This includes:\n\n- -Compliance with the Group's Resources and Reserves standard.\n- -Establishment of the Orebody Knowledge (OBK) Centre of Excellence.\n- -Development of operational KPIs to ensure inputs to Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve calculations remain valid. This includes spatial plan conformance and grade and tonnage reconciliation.\n- -Compliance with processes for optimal asset development and Resource and Reserve maintenance.\n\n## 12. Capital project delivery\n\nLarge capital investments require multi-year execution plans and are complex. Our ability to deliver projects to baseline plan - principally in terms of safety, cost and schedule - may vary due to changes in technical requirements (eg geotechnical), law and regulation, government or community expectations, or through commercial or economic assumptions proving inaccurate through the execution phase.\n\n## Management response\n\nWe develop large-scale capital projects through a specialised division. Our methodology includes:\n\n- -Implementation of the project management control framework and assurance activities to ensure compliance.\n- -Stakeholder engagement is managed by the product group that will have ownership of the project through to operation.\n- -Following a rigorous project approval and stage-gating process, including monitoring and status evaluation, as articulated in the project evaluation standard and guidance.\n- -Maintaining a strong focus on contractor management.\n- -Undertaking strategic workforce planning to ensure the critical roles are appropriately managed.\n\nEconomic\n\n## Opportunities\n\nThrough operational ef/ficiencies, deployment of new technologies or increased orebody knowledge we can improve the discovery of new Resources, convert a greater proportion of Resource to Reserve, and extract them in a more economical way.\n\n## Threats\n\nInadequate knowledge of our Resources and Reserves increases production costs and ore loss within our production systems. Failure to capture the bene/fits of new technologies may reduce our volume of available Reserves.\n\nEconomic\n\n## Opportunities\n\nAn ability to develop projects safely, on time and within budget enhances our cash /flow, licence to operate and investor con/fidence.

Many of our sites are also experiencing changes in rainfall and water availability due to climate change.\n\n## Management response\n\nWe aim to balance our operational water needs with those of local communities, Traditional Owners and ecosystems. We manage our water risks against four themes: water resource, quantity and quality, dewatering and long-term obligations. This framework allows us to identify, assess, manage and communicate water risk, controls and actions both internally and to the communities where we operate.

The Board Review of those events, the implementation of its recommendations and extensive engagement with stakeholders have been a signi/ficant focus of our activity this year. This will continue in 2021 as we work with the new executive leadership team to rebuild the trust that has been lost and apply the lessons of Juukan Gorge.\n\nIn my letter on pages 7 to 9 of this Annual Report, I spoke of my pride in the way Rio Tinto responded to the global COVID-19 pandemic, safeguarding our employees, contractors and local communities while keeping our operations running safely and smoothly.\n\nThe Board has also had to respond, as COVID-19 related travel restrictions prevented physical Board meetings. I am grateful to my fellow directors not only for their adaptability in ensuring that we still managed to complete our scheduled programme of work - including a 'virtual' site visit to Oyu Tolgoi - but also for their time and commitment in responding to the pandemic and Juukan Gorge. These activities are described in detail on the following pages.\n\nWe have seen signi/ficant changes to our Board in 2020. We welcomed three new non-executive directors - Hinda Gharbi, Jennifer Nason and Ngaire Woods - and have already bene/fited from their insights and expertise in natural resources, /finance, technology, governance, and public policy, and in fostering diversity and inclusion.\n\nAt/uni00A0the end of the year, Jakob Stausholm replaced J-S/uni00A0Jacques as Chief Executive, and David Constable stepped down to assume the role of CEO at Fluor Corporation.\n\nIn making appointments to the Board, our goal is to bring a range of expertise and diverse perspectives. Following the changes to the Board this year, we are fully compliant with both the Hampton Alexander and the Parker review guidelines on board composition.\n\nThe following pages set out the activities of the Board over the year, and how we have evolved our governance arrangements as we continue to learn and develop as an organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nChairman\n\n22 February 2021",

        "page_content": "## Juukan Gorge: the Board Perspective\n\n## The destruction of two ancient rock shelters in the Juukan Gorge represented a breach of our partners' trust and a failure to uphold our values as a company.\n\nA review of the events leading up to the destruction of the rock shelters published by the Rio Tinto Board of Directors in August 2020 identi/fied a series of systemic failures of our communities and heritage management processes at Brockman 4 over an extended period of time. To read the full review please visit www.riotinto.com/news/inquiry-into-juukan-gorge.\n\nBoth the Board Review and the Inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia (the Parliamentary Inquiry) make it clear that the events at Juukan Gorge represented a breach of our partners' trust and a failure to uphold our values as a company.\n\nThe Board is determined to learn the lessons to ensure that the destruction of a site of exceptional cultural signi/ficance never happens again.\n\n## The oversight role of our Sustainability Committee\n\nThe Sustainability Committee supports the Board in ensuring Rio Tinto delivers a strong business performance on a sustainable basis that builds trust with our people, our partners and stakeholders and with wider society.\n\nInternal and external reviews of the events leading to the blasting of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge have identi/fied various de/ficiencies including how our partnership with the PKKP people was managed, a lack of integration of our heritage management with our front-line operational teams, and a work culture that was too focused on business performance and not enough on building and maintaining relationships with Traditional Owners.\n\nThe archaeological and ethnographic reports received in 2013-14 should have triggered an internal review of the implications of this material new information for the mine development plans. Such a review did not take place. Following completion of the archaeological surveys and other mitigation measures agreed with the PKKP people in 2014, the site was reclassi/fied as 'cleared' for mining and removed from relevant risk registers. As a consequence, knowledge and awareness of the location and signi/ficance of the site was progressively lost. Further opportunities to revise the mine plan were missed in 2018, when the /final archaeological report was received, and again during 2019-20.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee has been charged with overseeing the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Board Review and Parliamentary Inquiry, and with ensuring that these lessons are applied to our operations across Australia and the globe. The Committee has already commenced the oversight of this implementation process and, at each of its six meetings in 2021, will receive updates on progress, as well as maintaining an ongoing overview of our global Communities and Social Performance (CSP) risks.\n\nImplementation of the recommendations will also form part of the new ESG component of the short term incentive plan for the Executive Committee and other relevant managers. For more detail, please refer to page 173 of our Remuneration Report.\n\n## Our new Integrated Heritage Management Process\n\nOne of the most important recommendations for the Sustainability Committee to oversee will be the full integration of heritage management into our mining operations such that our product groups have primary responsibility for our CSP partnerships and engagement. In visits on Country in late 2020, Board members heard how Traditional Owners want to engage directly with the person who is in control of the mine site, the drills and the dozers. It is clear that our mines' general managers also want this direct line of communication with Traditional Owners to ensure there is no room for error.\n\nAnother critical component is the new Integrated Heritage Management Process (IHMP).\n\nPhase 1 of the IHMP is well underway and comprises an assessment of all heritage sites, assessing each on the basis of cultural signi/ficance, which is informed through consultation with Traditional Owners. Over 1,000 sites have been reviewed to date and all sites of high cultural signi/ficance have been allocated protective buffer zones.\n\nUnder the IHMP, any approvals to disturb sites that are low to moderate signi/ficance are made at the Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive level with decisions regarding sites of high or very high signi/ficance being made at the Chief Executive level. Where there is any doubt, we have reclassi/fied the relevant sites from 'cleared' for mining back to 'protected' as a precautionary measure, pending further consultation with Traditional Owners. An increased level of consultation is also occurring, on an ongoing basis, to ensure a shared understanding of heritage sites and the proposed mine plans.\n\nPhase 2 of the IHMP will fully integrate heritage considerations into mine planning and development studies. Our aim is to ensure that Traditional Owners are actively involved in the management of the cultural heritage aspects of mine design. This will inform the conduct of resource development, studies and the approvals process.\n\nFurther information on the steps that we are taking in response to the recommendations of the Board Review and the Parliamentary Inquiry can be found on pages 10-11 and at riotinto.com. These include details of our commitment, in consultation with Traditional Owners, towards the modernisation of our agreements, the formation of an Indigenous Advisory Group and the status of the remedy process with the PKKP people, including a moratorium on mining in the Juukan Gorge area and a remediation plan for the rock shelters.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe overall effectiveness of any risk management framework requires clear expectations and consistency of application of the framework across different product groups and businesses, countries of operation and functional areas of expertise. Unfortunately, this did not happen in the case of Juukan Gorge.\n\nTo support the product groups, a new CSP Area of Expertise has been formed to own the relevant standards and procedures, and to ensure that best practices are consistent globally. This team will also provide the second line of assurance on CSP and ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right locations. Our Internal Audit team will provide the third line of assurance, reporting directly to the Sustainability Committee.\n\nThese changes to cultural heritage risk management are designed to deliver more rigorous assurance of the way we manage our communities and cultural heritage risks across our operations globally. The Audit Committee will monitor the effectiveness of these changes to our overall risk management and internal control framework.\n\n## Culture\n\nRisk frameworks are only ever as good as the information that /flows through them, and the experience and judgment of individual managers in key positions. This is particularly important in a group that is the size, scale and complexity of Rio Tinto.\n\nEffective management of community, heritage and other social risks is therefore dependent upon a work culture that creates the same awareness and accords the same priority to these issues as it does to operational, production or safety risks.\n\nOne of the key /findings from Juukan Gorge is that we need to provide additional training to our front-line operational managers on the increasingly complex social and environmental risks they are required to manage.\n\nEnsuring that we have the right work culture and relationships to support good decision-making will require sustained effort over many years. We have launched initiatives to increase awareness and training on community and heritage issues and the amount of time that general managers invest in our relationships.\n\nOver the past few months, the Board has held a series of virtual town halls and engagements with staff around the world to seek their views on what we need to do to create a more inclusive, more diverse work culture, where people feel empowered to challenge decisions. In particular, we need to ensure that Indigenous Australians have a stronger voice, not just in our host communities but also within the company. Alongside these steps to build a more inclusive work culture, it is clear that we need to break down silos within the company to ensure that community and heritage issues are fully integrated into business planning decisions (in exactly the same way as safety or production).\n\nThe appointment of Jakob Stausholm as our new Chief Executive represents an important milestone as we continue the process of rebuilding trust. One of the reasons the Board chose Jakob is because he will provide clear leadership of our efforts to re-establish Rio Tinto's reputation as an industry leader in environmental and social performance.\n\nIn April 2020, we appointed Hinda Gharbi and Jennifer Nason to the Board, and Professor Ngaire Woods joined us in September. All three new directors bring relevant experience of championing inclusion, diversity, cultural change and governance. We currently have a search underway for a fourth new NED, to replace David Constable. One of our selection criteria will be their ability to support this change programme.\n\n## Consequence management\n\nDuring the two weeks following the publication of the Board Review in August 2020, we engaged with over 70 of our shareholders, Traditional Owners, Indigenous leaders, the governments of Australia and Western Australia, and other stakeholders. At the end of that two-week period of intense engagement, the Board unanimously agreed that J-S Jacques, Chris Salisbury and Simone Niven should leave the company by mutual agreement as it was clear that a number of in/fluential shareholders and other important stakeholders (mainly, but not exclusively, in Australia) had lost con/fidence in their ability to lead the necessary change.\n\nWe acknowledge that some commentators believed that the Board should have acted sooner. There was, however, a very wide range of opinion on the appropriate sanctions and we believe that it was right, on a decision of this magnitude, to establish the facts and engage with as many stakeholders as possible before removing three of our most senior executives, including the Chief Executive, from the business.\n\nIn making the eligible leaver determination for the three executives, the Board fully recognised the gravity of the destruction at Juukan Gorge but was mindful that they did not deliberately cause the events to happen, they did not do anything unlawful, nor did they engage in fraudulent or dishonest behaviour or wilfully neglect their duties.\n\nIn making the /final determination on their separation terms, it was necessary to balance the /findings of the Board Review, the /financial penalties that had been applied and the loss of employment for the three individuals, on the one hand, against the considerable achievements of those executives over many years. In this context, the loss of employment was considered the greater sanction.\n\nThe full details of the separation terms for each executive are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 169 and 174.\n\nThe non-executive directors donated the equivalent of 10% of their 2020 non-executive director fees to the Clontarf Foundation, which supports education, training and employment for Indigenous Australians. Jakob Stausholm, the Chief Executive and executive director, has made a donation of an equivalent amount.",

During 2020, we have had to adapt to the challenges associated with COVID-19. As a consequence, all meetings have been held virtually and we have increased the number of Board and committee meetings. Set out below are some of the matters which the Board has considered during 2020.\n\nAt every Board meeting, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Of/ficer report on the safety, operating and business performance of the Group against our Key Performance Indicators, as well as how certain material stakeholder issues are being managed.\n\nThe Board also received detailed reports from management relating to progress on major growth projects and updates on operations. Examples in 2020 included:\n\n## Growth projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -In April, the Board received an update on the Simandou project. The management team presented a revised strategy and requested approval for funding to cover phase 1 of the work programme.\n- -In May, management presented a proposal to change the scope of the Oyu Tolgoi Hugo North Lift 1 underground mine design of Panel 0.\n- -The Board received a teach-in regarding the undercut criteria relating to the Oyu Tolgoi underground project. The session provided an overview of the undercut criteria, highlighting the risks and dependencies to undercut initiation, and covering the governance arrangements in place to track progress and to underpin informed decision-making.\n- -In October, the Board received a teach-in relating to battery materials/ lithium that analysed demand and supply drivers and options for the lithium project, as well as a deep dive on the Jadar project.\n- -The Board also considered and approved a request for almost $200 million to complete the Jadar feasibility study.\n\n## Operational\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -The Board considered changes in Australia's energy policies and the potential impacts to the Australian smelters.\n- -In July, the Board received, considered and approved a request for funding to execute the closure of the Argyle diamond mine, which was no longer economically viable. A presentation was given covering plans for demolition, disposal of infrastructure, earthworks and civil works for waste rock dump reshaping, tailings dam embankment protection and stability, water management and revegetation. The Board also noted the extensive stakeholder engagement that had taken place.\n\n## ESG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board has ultimate oversight of environmental, social and governance matters working alongside the Sustainability Committee. During the year, in addition to reviewing its forward agenda of matters to be discussed, considering its constitution, composition and performance, and reviewing any new or amended Group policies, the Board considered the following governance matters:\n\n- -The Group's response to the blasting of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, including consideration of the Board Review of the tragedy, the consequence management, the implementation of the recommendations for change, stakeholders' feedback and a meeting with the PKKP people.\n- -In February, the Board was updated on plans to publish the Group's 2020 carbon targets, climate strategy and proposed programme of engagement to accompany the publication of the company's second climate change report, following the methodology of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

        "page_content": "## Our Stakeholders\n\nOur business and the decisions that we make affect the lives of many around the world. Understanding the interests of our stakeholders, as well as our shareholders, and doing our best to take them into account when we make choices, remains a Board priority. In the following section, we detail our key stakeholders and summarise their interests, how the Board has engaged with them, and how what the Board has heard has in/fluenced our decision-making. This section serves as our 'section 172(1) statement'.\n\n## Employees\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe are proud of Rio Tinto's 45,000* employees, working in 35 countries around the world, who have demonstrated perseverance and resilience in a dif/ficult year. We are committed to their health and safety and ensuring that they work in a positive and respectful environment where they can learn, develop, and feel proud of the work they do - every shift, every day.\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\n- -Following the success of our 'employee AGMs' in past years, we have continued to engage directly with employees. While the outbreak of COVID-19 unfortunately prevented us holding a similar event this year, we continued to listen to the views of our employees.\n- -During November, the Chairman and non-executive directors held informal discussions with /five diverse groups, totalling close to 150 employees, across many time zones and parts of the business. Simon Thompson and Megan Clark also had a meeting with a small group of employees in our Perth hub to hear their views and insights on 2020 and beyond. This conversation was recorded and shared with the Group.\n- -With COVID-19 severely impacting the traditional ways that our Chief Executive and other leaders engage with employees, we quickly developed new and innovative ways to remain connected and provide support and reassurance to the workforce during the pandemic. This included virtual site visits, town halls and team check-ins, and a number of remote safety engagements with operational site teams. The main themes and issues from these engagements were regularly reported to the Board and considered in our decision-making.\n- -During August and September, the company conducted 66 employee focus groups to understand how perceptions and expectations have been impacted by COVID-19, the events at Juukan Gorge, and a number of other global events. These sessions also explored experiences and expectations relating to inclusion, diversity and sustainability. The /findings were reviewed in detail by the Board, together with the results of our employee survey which was held in October and November. This survey measures how people feel about the company and its direction.\n\n## Investors\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur investors include pension funds, global fund managers, bondholders, employees and tens of thousands of individuals around the world. They have all put their faith in Rio Tinto to provide them with a /financial return and expect us to allocate capital with discipline to create superior value. They are also increasingly focused on how that return is made. Our investors are closely interested in our strategy, the culture of the Group, sustainability, including cultural heritage, and our operational and /financial performance as well as the threats and opportunities which could affect our business.\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\n- -We hold two AGMs each year, in Australia and in the UK. The format of these, as both countries faced signi/ficant COVID-19-related restrictions on travel and gatherings, required a move to online events during 2020. By providing these online events, we ensured that investors were still able to engage with the Board and management.\n- -We also maintain a comprehensive programme of engagement with investors and analysts to ensure both current and potential new investors have the opportunity to hear from executives, the Chairman and subject matter experts from across the business. We held an online seminar in April in which the Chief Executive and experts from across the Group provided investors and analysts with an overview of our climate change strategy and approach to water management. This re/flects growing investor interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.\n- -The Investor Forum in the UK and Australian Council of Superannuation Investors in Australia hosted meetings with the Board and investors to talk about the events of the year, with a focus on Juukan Gorge and the lessons learned. The agenda and Q&A sessions focused on Board effectiveness, oversight and accountability, as well as the Group's licence to operate. The meetings were well received, complementing direct investor engagement through the year and setting out a framework to allow investors to assess action in the early part of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\n- -The honesty and openness shown by employees in the small group meetings with the Board provided important insights. We heard employees' appreciation of the company's response to COVID-19, their disappointment and shame regarding the events surrounding Juukan Gorge, their commitment to safety, wellbeing, inclusion and diversity, and concerns about fatigue and work-life balance. We heard about dif/ficulties in escalating unresolved issues, the need for a stronger focus on cultural heritage and awareness as well as diversity, and employees' desire to know more about the future shape and leadership of the organisation. These insights were an important consideration for the Board as we selected Jakob as our new Chief Executive and will receive greater focus as we set the agenda for the company under new leadership.\n- -The Board was pleased to see the positive response recorded in employee focus groups and the employee survey to the company's response to COVID-19, including its support for our people and the communities from which they come. Continuing to listen to employees, through focus groups, surveys and direct leader engagement, provides a wealth of opportunities for us to learn and improve as we continue to build a truly inclusive workplace culture. What has come through in all of the conversations the Board has had this year is how much employees appreciate the opportunity to share their thoughts. We see great value in these interactions and will continue the dialogue next year as part of our commitment to engage with Rio Tinto employees around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\n- -In responding to feedback from investors, the Board has continued to deliver a strategy of maximising shareholder returns while allocating capital with discipline for future growth and sustained operational performance through the macroeconomic and commodity cycles.\n- -Given investor interest in ESG issues, including climate change and our work with communities around the world, the Board considers these during its strategy sessions when assessing our portfolio positions.\n- -The Chairman engaged extensively with investors across multiple markets following the events at Juukan Gorge to understand their perspectives. Following the release of the Board Review, further engagements took place. The broad spectrum of opinion that was garnered from these engagements was important in helping the Board's decision-making that led to management changes.\n- -During 2020, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the effectiveness of our Remuneration Policy, which is due for renewal at the 2021 AGMs. The Committee Chair, Sam Laidlaw, consulted with shareholders and proxies during 2020 and this consultation supported the Committee's view that the current policy has served our stakeholders well. Notwithstanding this, the Committee felt there was scope for simpli/fication and an opportunity to align certain aspects more closely to shareholder and broader stakeholder expectations, most notably on pensions and by increasing the weighting of the ESG-related component in the short term incentive plan. These changes to the policy will be considered at the 2021 AGMs as part of the Committee's focus on ensuring that remuneration structure and policies reward fairly and responsibly with a clear link to corporate and individual performance that aligns remuneration outcomes with the delivery of long-term value for shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Communities and governments\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe interests of the communities and governments that host our operations around the world are vital to our success. We recognise that our business has the potential to impact them signi/ficantly in a number of ways; they, in turn, expect us to commit to high standards in managing our environmental footprint and respecting community and human rights. Our impacts can be both positive and negative and require a proactive approach to building trust and partnership. This trust can be easily lost, as the events at Juukan Gorge have shown, and it therefore requires constant focus and careful management to maintain. The economic impact of our business through the taxes we pay and the jobs that we create has remained important while our support for managing the impact of COVID-19 and direct involvement in protecting the health of our communities have become critical.\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\n- -In light of the events at Juukan Gorge, and following the release of the Board Review, the Board engaged extensively with stakeholders including Traditional Owners and Indigenous leaders. This provided an opportunity to apologise in person to the PKKP people and to see and feel their pain. As a Board, we are committed to learning from this event to ensure that the destruction of heritage sites of such exceptional archaeological and cultural signi/ficance never occurs again.\n- -We consult with our communities regularly, and always aim to do so in good faith, and in ways that are transparent, inclusive, and culturally appropriate. This covers every stage of the life of our assets. We strive to ensure that our engagement is participatory and representative of the community, including women, youth and vulnerable people. We recognise that our engagement processes can be further strengthened and have taken a number of actions to do so following the publication of our Board Review into cultural heritage/uni00A0management.\n- -Governments, at all levels, are critical stakeholders for our business and we regularly engage on matters including how we explore, mine and process ore, the conditions of land tenure, and health, safety and environmental requirements, as well as how we operate as a company in relation to securities, taxation, intellectual property, competition and foreign investment, provisions to protect data privacy, conditions of trade and export, and infrastructure access.\n- -We also engage with international organisations such as the World Bank and International Finance Corporation and actively participate in international forums like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the International Council on Mining and Metals.\n\n## Customers and suppliers\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe want to build long-term relationships with our customers and suppliers based on trust and mutual bene/fits. Transparency and ensuring that we deliver on our promises are critical in maintaining this trust and we focus on both.\n\nThrough the volatility of 2020, customers and suppliers worked with us to safely maintain our operations and the uninterrupted /flow of materials and products through the value chain, enhancing the integration between our markets and/uni00A0assets.\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\n- -The inability to exchange physical documentation during COVID-19 was a catalyst for us to expand on our digital interfaces with customers and suppliers in 2020. We completed the industry's /first end-to-end blockchain transaction in Renminbi, with the China Baowu Steel Group and will continue to pilot and adopt new digital tools to improve the experience of our customers and suppliers.\n- -We have extended our value chain and expanded our commercial activities into new areas to meet customer needs. This includes the expansion of our portside sales presence to nine ports in China, meeting demand from more than 80 new iron ore customers, and the expansion of bonded warehouse sales in our alumina business.\n- -We continue to focus on strategic partnerships as our customers become more concerned about how their products are produced. This includes partnering to develop new products such as with AB InBev to produce beverage cans made from low-carbon aluminium that meets industryleading sustainability standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\n- -While COVID-19 has signi/ficantly impacted plans for 2020, we have continued direct engagement between directors and those who advocate on behalf of communities around the world. The Chairman held a 'virtual roundtable' with civil society organisations, where the discussions focused on our response to Juukan Gorge, climate change and continuing concerns about industry lobbying.\n- -The Board has unreservedly apologised to the PKKP people for the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge. The Board and senior leadership team have taken decisive action to implement the recommendations set out in the Board Review and the Interim Report of the Parliamentary Inquiry. Details of these changes can be found on pages 114 to 115.\n- -The Board recognises the need to further increase its engagement with stakeholders close to our operations, including communities and governments. The appointment of Simon McKeon as Senior Independent Director for Rio Tinto Limited, as well as Kellie Parker as Chief Executive of the business in Australia, will increase engagement in Australia and the full Board will continue to prioritise engagement with local communities when interacting with Rio Tinto sites remotely or in person. We are consulting with Traditional Owners to create an Indigenous Advisory Group (IAG), intended to bring Indigenous voices into the senior leadership and oversight of the business in Australia. Through our annual Board level engagements with civil society organisations, we listen, learn and look at ways we can improve on a number of issues of interest to our stakeholders.\n- -With COVID-19 impacting communities worldwide, we have an important role to play in keeping our communities safe while ensuring we can continue to keep our operations running safely. We have taken extensive measures across the business to help protect our communities, and have increased these as the pandemic has spread, in line with guidance or directives from governments and advice from international health organisations.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\n- -Building on our /first customer survey in 2019, the Commercial team expanded the exercise in 2020, receiving feedback from more than 400 customers and suppliers across our products and major markets. The survey tested Rio Tinto's performance against more than 40 attributes, from product quality to technology. The high-level results of the survey were shared with the Board through regular updates provided by the Chief Executive in 2020. Key insights from the 2020 survey included the importance of digital capability to customers and improvements in areas such as collaboration and responsiveness.\n- -Amongst the Group's suppliers, the baseline provided by this /first survey in 2020 will allow us to continue to shape these important relationships, building on general satisfaction and areas of focus. Both surveys will be repeated in 2021.\n- -The Board will begin to track progress in customer and supplier satisfaction from the baselines developed in the 2019 (customers) and 2020 (suppliers) surveys, and identify any additional areas for focus.\n- -As with our other stakeholders, the events of 2020 required the Board to adjust its engagement methods. Planned physical visits by the Board to major customers and suppliers in Asia were postponed and will be held as soon as the global situation allows. In the meantime, we are exploring how members of the Board can engage remotely with a number of key customer and supplier representatives.",

        "page_content": "## Board Insights\n\n## Board tours Oyu Tolgoi in /first virtual site visit: adapting to COVID-19\n\nSite visits are an important part of the annual calendar for our Board - a chance for directors to deepen their understanding of our operations, and to meet with employees. This year, COVID-19 restrictions meant that plans for a physical visit to Mongolia had to be reconsidered - and the Oyu Tolgoi team were determined to give the Board a virtual tour that would be as close as possible to being there in person.\n\nWith exceptional planning, innovative use of technology, and the team's hard work and enthusiasm, they were able to create a four-hour interactive experience for the Board members, who joined from their respective homes.\n\n## Plan, test and plan some more\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi team used elements of live video, 3D transition and pre-taped news style footage to showcase the different areas of our business.\n\nThe Board virtually visited open pit operations, the concentrator and the underground development. They heard from subject matter experts from across Oyu Tolgoi about the environmental, social and governance aspects of the business, including our water recycling activities, local procurement and, community partnerships.\n\nThe team tried something new with the background reading material sent to the Board members before the event too, and created an interactive book instead of the more usual PDF.\n\nTo complement the virtual site visit and ahead of key investment and project decisions regarding the OT underground project, including the approval of the OT Hugo North Lift 1 (HNL1) Panel 0 mine design feasibility study and underground project 2020 estimate, the Board received a teach-in providing an overview of the undercut criteria relating to the Oyu Tolgoi underground project. The Board discussed and agreed the criteria that would be developed for further Board review to manage the key risks to undercut initiation, including mine design, development and construction, power certainty, funding, and sovereign risk. The Board noted that Rio Tinto Copper & Diamonds and the Oyu Tolgoi joint venture would manage other aspects such as business readiness, technical assurance, permitting, and access to market.\n\nOT has such a strong story on performance - particularly the safety ethos and enthusiasm for continuous improvement - that shines through from everyone. We really get the feeling you have developed a great culture on site, which is hugely impacted by the high and increasing local capability. A great example to others, and your pride in this is understandable - and tangible to the entire Board.\n\nSimon Henry Non-executive director",

        "page_content": "The time I spent with each of more than 30 senior leaders in the company enabled me to learn about each of the different businesses of Rio Tinto, as well as to begin to understand the different geographies within which Rio Tinto operates.\n\nNgaire Woods Non-executive director\n\n## NED inductions\n\nWe have developed comprehensive induction processes for new Board members which aim to provide a broad introduction to the Group, and enable new directors to contribute to the Board's deliberations from the outset.\n\nWe appointed three new non-executive directors this year, Hinda Gharbi, Jennifer Nason and Ngaire Woods. Each received a tailored programme comprising one-to-one meetings with Board directors, Executive Committee members and senior leaders across the business. This was supported by a comprehensive library of internal and external reports, memos and presentations covering the key commercial, operational and functional areas of the Group. Ordinarily, visits to mine sites and operations form an important part of induction but, due to the COVID-19 related restrictions, this has not been possible during 2020. We very much hope to reintroduce site visits for directors during 2021 as restrictions ease. The absence of face-to-face engagement was re/flected in feedback from new directors on the effectiveness of the induction process, but this was otherwise positive.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nAs we have mentioned elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged us to rethink in 2020 how the Board engages with employees. Restrictions on international travel, and on social gathering, meant that our usual large-scale events such as 'employee AGMs' and town halls were not possible in 2020. Instead, we developed a series of smaller-scale engagements, primarily in virtual formats, to ensure that the Board continued to engage with employees and hear their views directly.\n\nThe events included /five informal discussions. The Chairman and a number of non-executive directors attended each event and employee attendance was limited to between 15 and 35 employees per event to maximise the opportunity for active participation. By mixing time zones and participants, these sessions managed to include representatives from almost all product groups and Group functions.\n\nThe induction sessions for new directors were extremely thorough and comprehensive, covering all product groups and major functions.\n\nJennifer Nason Non-executive director\n\nIn addition, in November, Simon Thompson and Megan Clark met in person with a group of /five employees in our Perth hub to understand their thoughts on 2020 and beyond. That conversation was recorded, and the video was shared with all employees via the Group intranet to give everyone an opportunity to hear the re/flections from colleagues and from the Board.\n\nWe sought feedback from participants after each of these events. It was good to see that employees were very positive about the format and conduct of the discussions and welcomed the opportunity to engage with the Board in this way. At each of the sessions employees were clearly very engaged and not afraid to ask dif/ficult questions on sensitive topics.\n\nThe questions and comments raised covered a very wide range of topics including, among others, the events at Juukan Gorge and the Group's response, the desired credentials for the new Chief Executive (as the search was ongoing at that time) and the direction and culture of the organisation. The questions also re/flected a clear interest in safety, work-life balance and inclusion and diversity.\n\nThese questions, feedback and insights from employees are hugely valuable to the Board. They have already been factored into discussions around the Board table and will continue to in/fluence our decision-making and the monitoring of how culture is embedded under our new Chief Executive and the new Executive Committee team.\n\nWhilst we all hope it will soon be possible to ease the current COVID-19 restrictions and return to some form of normality, the emergence and establishment of these new formats and channels of employee/Board engagement have been a positive development in 2020. We will continue to develop them, in addition to more traditional forms of face-to-face engagement as we continue in consultation with our newly designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, Simon McKeon, to make sure the voice of our employees is heard in the boardroom.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluating our Performance\n\n## An effective Board depends on the personal development of individual directors and continuous improvement in the operation of the Board as a whole.\n\nWe measure our performance each year by carrying out a formal annual review of the Board, its committees and the Chairman. Every third year we engage a professional external adviser to carry out the Board review to obtain an independent evaluation. In 2020 we carried out an internal Board evaluation, with the process overseen by the Group Company Secretary. The evaluation is based on a questionnaire to all directors and the views of directors are consolidated into a formal report which is discussed by the Board and the relevant committees.\n\nThe Board evaluation process identi/fied some areas of strength. This notably included the way in which Rio Tinto had responded to COVID-19, with the Chief Executive able to adjust priorities across the business to focus on responding to the immediate issues. The Board felt that it had adapted to the new way of working and that there was greater opportunity to use virtual meetings and site visits in the future. The atmosphere in the boardroom was rated highly and the Board felt that it had worked coherently and well during recent challenges, albeit the lack of informal time for the Board was noted and the importance of engagement with senior leadership was also stressed. Feedback on the skills and experience of the Board identi/fied a need to bring a better understanding of China into the boardroom.\n\nOne area where some Board members felt more could have been done was engagement with stakeholders, which is a re/flection of the events at Juukan Gorge. A clear theme that emerged was the importance of the transition to a new Chief Executive in 2021 and supporting them in evolving Rio Tinto's culture and rebuilding trust, notably in Australia. The Board's monitoring of the culture and behaviours throughout the organisation was identi/fied as an area of focus. The need for the new Chief Executive to prioritise alignment of organisation culture with our values was stressed.\n\n## Individual assessments\n\nThe Chairman is responsible for evaluating the performance of non-executive directors. In 2020, he met each non-executive director to review their views on and contribution to the Board, as well as their training requirements.\n\nThe non-executive directors, led by Sam Laidlaw, senior independent director, Rio Tinto plc, are responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman. The senior independent director met with the non-executive directors and, separately, the executive directors to gather feedback to provide to the Chairman on his performance.

        "page_content": "## Nominations Committee Report\n\nThe Nominations Committee seeks to ensure that the Board has the requisite mix of skills, views, experience and expertise to provide robust oversight, and to identify and respond effectively to current and future opportunities and challenges.\n\nIn our approach to succession planning and appointments, we are committed to building an effective, diverse, knowledgeable Board that can provide robust oversight, encourage differing perspectives, promote collaboration, fairness and inclusion, and convene expertise effectively to help it navigate the increasingly complex opportunities and threats facing the Group.\n\n2020 was a year that tested many parts of our business. Our response to COVID-19 in many ways showed the Group at its best, with fast, delegated decision-making within a clear values-based framework that put the safety of our employees, contractors and local communities /first, while allowing our operations to keep running and delivering for customers.\n\nThe events at Juukan Gorge, however, were a sobering reminder that, no matter how sophisticated our risk management processes, in cases like this, the effectiveness of Board oversight is ultimately dependent upon the recognition of risk and escalation of decision-making by front-line operational staff. Increasing cultural awareness and understanding of community, heritage and other social risks, and ensuring that operational management has access to the information it needs to support good decision-making, will be a key focus for the Board and the senior executive team in 2021.\n\nWith the departure of three of the most senior executives in the Group as a result of Juukan Gorge, the Nominations Committee was extremely busy in the latter part of 2020. Our top priority was the appointment of a new Chief Executive. Drawing upon our existing internal succession planning and an external search, in December 2020, we announced the appointment of Jakob Stausholm as Chief Executive. Jakob has made a signi/ficant contribution to the performance and the strategy of the Group since joining as CFO two years ago and his appointment represents an important milestone as we start the process of rebuilding trust. With strong values and an inclusive, collaborative leadership style, we are con/fident Jakob will provide clear leadership of our efforts to re-establish Rio Tinto's leadership in environmental and social performance. Further details of the appointment process and the selection of Jakob are set out on the following page.\n\nIn November, David Constable announced he would be stepping down from the Board to concentrate on his appointment as the Chief Executive of Fluor Corporation. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank David for his signi/ficant contribution to our Board discussions. A search for David's replacement is underway as we seek to further strengthen representation on the Board from our key countries of operation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nNominations Committee Chairman\n\n22 February 2021\n\n## Nominations Committee members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson (Chairman)\n\nMegan Clark\n\nDavid Constable*\n\nHinda Gharbi\n\nSimon Henry\n\nSam Laidlaw\n\nMichael L'Estrange\n\nSimon McKeon\n\nJennifer Nason\n\nNgaire Woods\n\n- * A member during 2020, stood down at the end of 2020.\n\n## Appointments to the Board - our policy\n\nWe base our appointments to the Board on merit, and on objective selection criteria, with the aim of bringing a range of skills, knowledge, and experience to Rio Tinto. This involves a formal and rigorous process to source strong candidates from diverse backgrounds and conducting appropriate background and reference checks on the shortlisted candidates. We aim to appoint people who will help us address the operational and strategic challenges and opportunities facing the company and ensure that our Board is diverse in terms of gender, nationality, social background and cognitive style. As such, we only engage recruitment agencies that are signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on diversity best practice.\n\nWe believe that an effective Board combines a range of perspectives with strong oversight, combining the experience of directors who have developed a deep understanding of our business over several years with the fresh insights of newer appointees. We aim for our Board composition to re/flect the global nature of Rio Tinto's business. We currently have six different nationalities (including dual nationalities) on a Board of 11.\n\nThe key skills and experience of our Board are set out on the table at the end of this report.",

        "page_content": "Our diversity and inclusion policy sets out our expectations around the behaviours needed for an inclusive and diverse workplace. The policy is co-owned and supported by the Rio Tinto Board and Executive Committee. At a Group level, we report against gender diversity targets (see page 76). In addition, each of our operations has local employment targets; their performance against these targets can be found in our 2020 Sustainability Fact Book.\n\nRead our full policy on our website - riotinto.com/sustainability/policies.\n\n## Our key responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Nominations Committee is to review the composition of the Board. The Committee leads the process for appointments, making recommendations to the Board as part of succession planning for both non-executive and executive directors. It also approves proposals for appointments to the Executive Committee and monitors the succession planning and development of a diverse talent pipeline for Executive Committee members and their direct reports.\n\n## Membership of the Committee\n\nAll non-executive directors are members of the Nominations Committee.\n\nThe Chief Executive and the Chief People Of/ficer are invited to attend all or part of meetings, as appropriate. The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board, unless the matter under consideration relates to the role of the Chairman. During 2020, the Chief Executive did not attend meetings where his succession was discussed.\n\n## Our search process for the Chief Executive appointment\n\nMWM Consulting were appointed to support the search process. Candidates proposed by MWM were shortlisted by the Nominations Committee before a series of interviews of the shortlisted candidates by various non-executive directors and the Chairman. The leading candidates were also assessed by YSC Consulting. Neither /firm has any connection with Rio Tinto. A /final proposal from the Nominations Committee recommending Jakob was made to the Board in December 2020 and the proposed terms of his appointment were reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nIn 2021, the Committee will re-focus on broader succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee. In his /first year as Chief Executive, Jakob's priorities will include a review of the development needs of the senior executive team and the appointment of a new Chief Financial Of/ficer. The Nominations Committee will oversee and recommend appointments to the Board and support Jakob in other senior appointments and leadership succession planning.\n\n## Changes affecting existing Board members\n\nThe role of the Senior Independent Director is well established in the UK. In 2020, in recognition of Rio Tinto's DLC structure and the importance of Australia to the Group's operations, the Board appointed Simon McKeon as Senior Independent Director of Rio Tinto Limited to provide an alternative, Australia-based sounding board for our key stakeholders. This newly created Board role will complement the existing Senior Independent Director role, which will continue to be performed by Sam Laidlaw for Rio Tinto plc.\n\nSince Australia is also the country where our most signi/ficant operations are located, as well as the largest number of employees, Simon McKeon has also been appointed as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, working closely with the Chairman and Group Company Secretary.\n\n## New appointments - improving diversity on the Board\n\nRio Tinto is committed to promoting behaviours that support an inclusive and diverse workplace and that re/flect our values of safety, teamwork, respect, integrity and excellence. This commitment is set out in our global code of conduct, The Way We Work .\n\nIn 2020, we were pleased to announce the appointment of Hinda Gharbi, Jennifer Nason and Ngaire Woods as non-executive directors, taking the proportion of women on the Board to 33.3% (four women and eight men) as at the end of 2020. Since 1 January 2021, following the departures of J-S Jacques and David Constable, this has increased to 40%. Hinda Gharbi has also identi/fied herself as a 'director of colour' for the purposes of the Parker review, which champions greater ethnic diversity on UK boards.\n\n## Appointment of Jakob Stausholm as our new Chief Executive\n\nIn September 2020, we announced that, by mutual agreement, J-S Jacques would step down from his role as an executive director and Chief Executive of the Group. A formal process to identify his successor commenced. J-S agreed to remain in his role until the appointment of his successor or 31 March 2021, whichever was earlier. This was to ensure business continuity and, speci/fically, to maintain the resilient performance of the Group's global operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Nominations Committee oversaw a selection process that drew upon existing internal succession planning and an external international search, culminating in the appointment of Jakob as Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2021. J-S therefore stepped down from his role as an executive director and Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2021 and will leave the Group on 31 March 2021.\n\nDetails of the structure of the remuneration package for Jakob and the leaving arrangements for J-S are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 140-185.\n\nJakob has already played a key role in strategy development and performance management since joining the Group as Chief Financial Of/ficer, delivering the company's disciplined capital allocation strategy, which in turn led the Group to deliver record shareholder returns. He has a proven track record as a senior executive with deep industrial and resources experience spanning strategy and technology as well as /financial and risk management. He has also demonstrated the ability to build effective relationships, both internally and in some of our key countries of operation.\n\nThis blend of strategic and commercial expertise, taken together with Jakob's collaborative leadership style, strong values and personal commitment to the role of business in promoting sustainability, make him the ideal choice for our Chief Executive. A further advantage is that, as an internal candidate, he will be able to apply his existing knowledge and understanding of the Group to some of the key investment and growth decisions arising in the shorter term.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nThe Committee has engaged Spencer Stuart to support the searches for recent non-executive director appointments. Spencer Stuart does not have any other connection with Rio Tinto. When considering candidates, the Committee has requested that both gender and ethnic diversity be considered when putting candidates forward.\n\nThe Board recognises that it has a critical role to play in creating an environment in which all contributions are valued, different perspectives are embraced, and biases are acknowledged and overcome. The Board shares ownership with the Executive Committee of the Group's inclusion and diversity policy, which can be found on the Group's website. We also discuss diversity and inclusion in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report.\n\n## Senior leadership - gender diversity\n\nThe Group has continued to set measurable gender diversity objectives for the composition of senior leadership and graduate intake. Progress on diversity is shown in the Sustainability section on page 76, where we show a breakdown by seniority. In 2021, we plan to leverage the gains in/uni00A02020 and will expand our gender diversity targets beyond women in leadership to women at all levels of the organisation.\n\n## Focus of the Committee in 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Committee will support Jakob as he transitions into his new role as Chief Executive and /fills the senior management vacancies created by recent departures and promotions. The Committee is currently conducting a search for a replacement for David Constable and will continue to review the skills and experience of the directors and the composition of committees.\n\n## Length of tenure of non-executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Skills and experience of the Chairman and non-executive directors\n\n| Area of expertise                      |                                                                                                                                                | No. of  Directors   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Business leadership                    | Board level experience in a major corporation.                                                                                                 | 7                   |\n| Capital projects                       | Experience of developing large-scale, long-cycle capital projects.                                                                             | 5                   |\n| Financial                              | Pro/ficiency in /financial accounting and reporting, corporate /finance,  internal controls, treasury and associated risk management.          | 5                   |\n| Mergers and acquisitions               | Experience of mergers, acquisitions, disposals and joint ventures.                                                                             | 5                   |\n| Global experience                      | Work experience in multiple global locations, exposed to a range of  political, cultural, regulatory and business environments.                | 8                   |\n| Corporate governance                   | Experience on the board of a major corporation subject to rigorous  corporate governance standards.                                            | 6                   |\n| Government and international relations | Interaction with governments and regulators or involvement in public  policy development and implementation.                                   | 4                   |\n| HSSE/ESG                               | Familiarity with issues associated with workplace health and safety,  asset integrity, environment and social responsibility, and communities. | 6                   |\n| Climate change                         | Knowledge and experience of climate-related threats and opportunities  including climate science, low-carbon transition and public policy.     | 6                   |\n| Communities and social performance     | Experience of working with communities to optimise the bene/fits and  minimise negative impacts of business activities.                        | 6                   |\n| Marketing                              | Senior executive experience in marketing, and the development of  product and/or customer management strategies.                               | 2                   |\n| Mining                                 | Senior executive experience in a large, global mining organisation  involved in the discovery, development, operation and closure of mines.    | 2                   |\n| HR/remuneration                        | Experience of talent recruitment, retention, development and incentives. including digital technology.                                         | 4 2                 |\n| Technology/digital                     | Experience of managing research, development, and innovation,                                                                                  |                     |",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee Report\n\nI am pleased to report on the work of the Audit Committee (the/uni00A0'Committee') in 2020. This is set out in detail over the following pages, but in this introduction I would just like to highlight a few aspects of a quite extraordinary year.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Group had to respond to the unprecedented challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I have been hugely impressed with the agility, innovation and tenacity our people have demonstrated to keep assets operating safely despite the severe restrictions on travel, and the need to socially distance and work remotely. From an Audit Committee perspective, it has been reassuring to see the organisation adapt to maintain the effectiveness of internal controls. We have also seen proactive responses to new risks emerging from the COVID-19 environment. While longer term there is no substitute for 'boots on the ground', the Group has embraced new ways of working in 2020 to support the continued integrity of our control framework.\n\nWe changed our external auditor, with the appointment of KPMG at the 2020 AGMs. To change auditors in a large and complex organisation such as Rio Tinto is a signi/ficant undertaking, requiring substantial transition planning and preparation work. KPMG shadowed PwC through the 2019 audits and engaged extensively with management to build their knowledge of this company and develop an audit plan. We are also already seeing some of the bene/fits of periodically rotating the external auditor as 'fresh eyes' suggest potential enhancements and challenge us to reconsider and substantiate assumptions.\n\nThe Audit Committee is acutely aware of the issues arising from the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters in May/uni00A02020, in particular the weaknesses it exposed in the risk management and internal control framework, and to relevant culture and behaviours within the company. Looking forward, the lessons learned, and actions now being taken, will form part of the Committee's consideration of the effectiveness of the overall control framework.\n\nWe welcomed Hinda Gharbi to the Board and as a member of this Committee in March 2020. Hinda has already familiarised herself with the Group and in just a few short months, this Committee has come to rely upon her experience and insight. David Constable stepped down as a director at the end of 2020. We will miss his wise counsel, but wish him well as he embarks on a new role as CEO of Fluor Corporation.\n\nMore widely, we continue to monitor developments in the UK audit market following the Brydon, Kingman and CMA reviews. While the /final destination is not yet clear, discussions have continued during 2020 on the direction of travel, and we continue to play our part in the ongoing consultation process.\n\nAs we look to 2021, we see an increased focus on the way companies re/flect the potential impact of climate change in /financial reporting. In addition to the usual work of the Committee, this is something we expect to explore further, including appropriate consideration and assurance around reporting under the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Henry Audit Committee chairman\n\n22 February 2021\n\n## Audit Committee members\n\nSimon Henry (Chairman)\n\nDavid Constable*\n\nHinda Gharbi\n\nSimon McKeon\n\n- * A member during 2020, stood down at the end of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Membership\n\nThe members of the Committee are all independent non-executive directors, and their biographies can be found on pages 116-117. The/uni00A0Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Committee.\n\nAs Rio Tinto's securities are listed in Australia, the UK and the US, we/uni00A0follow the regulatory requirements and best practice governance recommendations for audit committees in each of these markets.\n\n## Australian listing requirements\n\nIn Australia, the members, and the Committee as a whole, meet the independence requirements of the ASX Principles. Speci/fically, the Committee members between them have the accounting and /financial expertise and a suf/ficient understanding of the industry in which the company operates to be able to discharge the Committee's mandate/uni00A0effectively.",

Simon Henry, the chairman of the Committee, is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant /financial experience.\n\nSimon Henry and David Constable both have extensive prior experience of the natural resources sector. Simon McKeon has gained experience of the mining sector by serving on the Board and on the Committee, and through regular site visits, reports and presentations. The Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which the company operates.\n\n## US listing requirements\n\nIn the US, the requirements for the Committee's composition and role are set out in SEC and NYSE rules. The Board has designated Simon Henry as an 'audit committee /financial expert'. The Board also believes that the other members of the Committee are /financially literate by virtue of their wide business experience.\n\n## Induction for new members\n\nNew members receive a comprehensive induction. As part of her induction, Hinda Gharbi met the Group Financial Controller, the heads of Group Internal Audit, Ethics & Integrity and Investor Relations, and the lead audit engagement partners in the UK and Australia.\n\n## Committee remit\n\nThe Committee's objectives and responsibilities are set out in our terms of reference (see the Rio Tinto website). These follow the relevant best practice recommendations in Australia, the UK and the US.\n\n## Our main duties are:\n\nFinancial reporting - we review the key judgments needed to apply accounting standards and to prepare the Group's /financial statements. We also review the narrative reporting that goes with these, with the aim of maintaining integrity in the Group's /financial reporting. Finally, we monitor any exclusions made in deriving alternative (non-GAAP) performance measures such as underlying earnings.\n\nExternal audit - we oversee the relationship with the external auditors and review all the non-audit services they provide, and the fees for these, to safeguard the auditors' independence and objectivity. We also assess the effectiveness of the external audit and, when necessary, carry out a formal tender process to select new auditors.\n\nFramework for internal control and risk management - we monitor the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls, including those over /financial reporting. We also oversee the Group's risk management framework.\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) - we oversee the work of GIA, and its head, who reports functionally to our Committee chairman.\n\nEthics and Integrity - we oversee the work of the Group's Ethics & Integrity function.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves - we oversee the reporting and assurance of mineral resources, and consider the impact on /financial reporting.\n\nDistributable Reserves - we provide assurance to the Board that distributable reserves are suf/ficient, and in the correct corporate entities, to support any dividend proposals.\n\nThese duties feed into an annual work plan that ensures we consider issues on a timely basis. The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its remit. We have the power to use any Group resources we may reasonably require, and we have direct access to the external auditors. We can also obtain independent professional advice at the Group's expense, where we deem necessary. No such advice was required during 2020.\n\nThe Committee chairman reports to the Board after each meeting on the main items discussed, and the minutes of our meetings are circulated to the Board.\n\nWe had six Committee meetings in 2020. Attendance at these meetings is included in the table on page 127. The Committee has met twice to date in 2021.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, the Chief Financial Of/ficer, the Group Financial Controller and the heads of GIA, Ethics & Integrity and Risk regularly attend our meetings, as do the Group General Counsel and the Group Company Secretary. We invite other senior executives and subjectmatter experts as needed.\n\nThe external auditors were present at all of the Committee meetings during the year. The auditors review all materials on accounting or tax matters in advance of each meeting, and their comments are included in the papers circulated to Committee members. The audit partners also meet with our Committee chairman ahead of each meeting to discuss key issues and raise any concerns.\n\nThe Committee meets regularly in private session. We also hold regular private discussions with the external auditors. Management do not attend these sessions. The Committee chairman also has regular contact and discussions with these stakeholders outside the formal meetings.\n\n## Use of Committee meeting time in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other focus areas in 2020\n\nIn addition to our scheduled workload, the Committee also considered:\n\n- -An annual review and benchmarking of Rio Tinto's accounting policies and an overview of newly issued IFRS standards and interpretations\n- -A summary of the key /financial measures relating to the Group's pension plans and the factors affecting those /figures\n- -Possible enhancements to the Group's Long Term Viability Statement, and the scenario modelling that underpins it, based on the recommendation in the Brydon Report\n- -After a robust process, in early 2021 the Committee recommended to the Board that the draft 2020 Annual Report is, taken as a whole, fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nWe also reviewed the quality and effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk management systems in a joint session with the Sustainability Committee, which oversees a number of key corporate risks. This review included the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over /financial reporting, and the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with sections 404 and 302 of the US SarbanesOxley Act 2002. The Committee also considered reports from GIA and KPMG on their work in reviewing and auditing the control environment.",

For cash-generating units where impairment indicators were  identi/fied, the Committee considered the key judgments made by management in  relation to discount rates and forecasted commodity prices. For cash-generating units  with recent experience of impairments, the Committee discussed with management the  conclusion supporting no further impairment trigger. Speci/fically with respect to Oyu  Tolgoi the Committee received an update on the status of the mine design and the  challenges relating to funding. The Committee reviewed disclosures related to  impairment reviews in note 6 and the net impairment charges of $1.2 billion. |\n| Application of the policy for items excluded from  underlying earnings              | The Committee reviewed the Group's policy for exclusion of certain items from  underlying earnings and con/firmed the consistent application of this policy year on year.  The items excluded from underlying earnings comprised a net expense of $2.7 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Estimate of provision for closure, restoration and  environmental obligations       | A reconciliation of underlying earnings to net earnings is presented in note 2. The Committee reviewed the signi/ficant changes in the estimated provision for closure,  restoration and environmental obligations by product group and legacy management.  The Committee received updates on closure studies completed in the period and  discussed with management changes to the discount rate. At 31 December 2020, the  Group's balance sheet included provision for close-down, restoration and environmental  obligations of $13.3 billion. The Committee was pleased to see the enhanced voluntary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Climate change                                                                      | The Committee received an overview of the work management is undertaking in relation  to climate change and the potential /financial reporting implications thereof. The  Committee reviewed the description of the internal price setting process described in  note 1 and discussed with management the three strategic scenarios, the alignment  with the Paris Agreement, and the connection between reserves and resources and  accounting judgments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| The Group's tax exposures                                                           | The Committee considered management's assessment of the Group's tax exposures,  including the recoverability of deferred tax assets which are uncertain due to the timing  of expiry of tax loss carry-forwards in certain jurisdictions. The Committee received  updates on the status of ongoing discussions with the Australian Tax Of/fice relating to  the transfer pricing of certain transactions with the Group's commercial centre in  Singapore and considered the appropriateness of provisions for uncertain tax positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Litigation                                                                          | management's assessment of any /financial provisions or contingent liabilities.

The UK entity of KPMG audits Rio Tinto plc, and the Australian entity audits Rio Tinto Limited. The UK audit engagement partner, Stephen Oxley, and the Australian partner, Trevor Hart, were appointed in 2020. Stephen Oxley has announced that he will be retiring from KPMG to take up an external position after the Rio Tinto 2020 audit and will hand over to his successor as the UK audit engagement partner before leaving the /firm at the end of March/uni00A02021.\n\nWe agreed the scope of the auditors' review of the half-year accounts, and of their audit of the full-year accounts taking into consideration the key risks and areas of material judgment for the Group. We also approved the fees for this work and the engagement letters for the auditors.\n\n## Safeguarding independence and objectivity, and maintaining effectiveness\n\nIn our relationship with the external auditor we need to ensure that they retain their independence and objectivity, and are effective in performing the statutory audit.\n\n## Use of the external auditors for non-audit services\n\nThe external auditors have signi/ficant knowledge of our business and of how we apply our accounting policies. That means it is sometimes cost-ef/ficient for them to provide non-audit services. There may also be con/fidentiality reasons that make the external auditors the preferred choice for a particular task.\n\nHowever, safeguarding the external auditors' objectivity and independence is an overriding priority. For this reason, and in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard, the Committee ensures that the external auditors do not perform any functions of management, undertake any work which they may later need to audit or rely upon in the audit, or serve in an advocacy role for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee Report\n\n## continued\n\nWe have a policy governing the use of the auditors to provide non-audit services. The cap on the total fees that may be paid to the external auditors for non-audit services in any given year is 70% of the average of the audit fees for the preceding three years. This is in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard. Non-audit assignments fall into two broad categories:\n\n- -Audit, audit-related or other 'pre-approved' services where we believe there is no threat to auditors' independence and objectivity, other than through the fees payable.\n- -Other services approved under delegated authority. We apply different approval regimes to these areas of work. Approval of 'pre-approved' services is as follows:\n- -Up to $50,000 - subject to prior noti/fication to management, this work can be awarded.\n- -From $50,001 to $100,000 - requires the Chief Financial Of/ficer's approval.\n- -Over $100,000 and with a tender process - if the external auditors are successful in the tender, the appointment requires the Chief Financial Of/ficer's approval.\n- -From $100,001 to $250,000 without a tender process - requires the Chief Financial Of/ficer's approval.\n- -Over $250,000, without a tender process - requires the Committee's or Committee chairman's approval.\n\nIn each case, the nature of the assignment and the fees payable are reported to the Committee.\n\nThe Chief Financial Of/ficer can approve other services up to the value of $50,000 and an aggregate value of no more than $100,000. Fees exceeding $100,000 in aggregate require approval from the Committee or the Committee chairman.\n\nAt the half-year and year-ends, the Chief Financial Of/ficer and the external auditors report to the Committee on non-audit services performed and the fees payable. Individual services are also reported to the Committee at each meeting that have either been approved since the previous meeting, or that require approval for commencement following the meeting.\n\nAll of the non-audit services provided by KPMG in 2020 were either within the predetermined approval levels or approved by the Committee. We are satis/fied that the provision of non-audit services by KPMG in accordance with this procedure is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors and the other requirements of the relevant Australian, UK and US regulations.\n\n## Fees for audit and non-audit services\n\nThe amounts payable to the external auditors, in each of the past two years were:\n\n|            |   2020  $m |   2019 $m |\n|------------|------------|-----------|\n| Audit fees |       17.3 |      16.4 |\n\n## Non-audit service fees:\n\n| Assurance services              | 2.2   | 2.7   |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Taxation services               | 0.0   | 0.1   |\n| All other fees                  | 0.1   | 0.0   |\n| Total non-audit service fees    | 2.3   | 2.8   |\n| Non-audit: audit fees (in-year) | 13%   | 17%   |\n\nFor further analysis of these fees, please see note 38.\n\nNone of the individual non-audit assignments was signi/ficant, either in terms of the work done or the fees payable. We have reviewed the non-audit work in aggregate. We are satis/fied that neither the work done, nor the fees payable, compromised the independence or objectivity of KPMG as our external auditors.\n\n## Independence of the external auditors\n\nKPMG are required to provide a declaration to the directors in relation to their compliance with the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the professional code of conduct for external auditors. A copy of this is on page 311.\n\nNo person who served as an of/ficer of Rio Tinto during 2020 was a director or partner of KPMG at a time when they conducted an audit of the Group.\n\n## Effectiveness of the external auditors\n\nWe review the effectiveness of the external auditors each year at our meeting in June. We consider the results of a survey containing questions on the auditors' objectivity, quality and ef/ficiency. The survey is completed by a range of operational and corporate executives across the business, and by Committee members. The review in June 2020 related to the outgoing auditors, PwC, and the overall rating was positive. The effectiveness of KPMG will be reviewed in June 2021.\n\nIn addition in 2020 the outgoing auditors PwC provided additional feedback to the Committee on the operation of /financial processes and the internal control framework within the company, based on recent years' audit experience.\n\n## Appointment of the auditors\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of KPMG as external auditors in 2020 and in the year to date. We have recommended to the Board that KPMG should be retained in this role for 2021, which the Board supports.\n\nKPMG have indicated that they are willing to continue as auditors of Rio Tinto. A resolution to reappoint them as auditors of Rio Tinto plc will therefore be proposed as a joint resolution at the 2021 AGMs, together with a separate resolution seeking authority for the Committee to determine the external auditors' remuneration.\n\nSubject to the approval of the above resolution, KPMG will continue in of/fice as auditors of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nWe review Rio Tinto's internal control systems and the risk management framework. We also monitor risks falling within our remit, especially those relating to the integrity of /financial reporting. A summary of the business's internal control and risk management systems, and of the principal risks and uncertainties we face, is in the Strategic Report on pages 92-95.\n\nImportantly, responsibility for operating and maintaining the internal control environment and risk management systems sits at asset level. Leaders of our businesses and functions are required to con/firm annually: that adequate internal controls are in place; that these are operating effectively and are designed to identify any failings and weaknesses that may exist; and that any required actions are taken promptly.\n\nTwo management committees, the Executive Committee and the Disclosure Committee, review reports on the Group's control framework. The work they do satis/fies the relevant requirements of the Code, the ASX Principles, the NYSE Standards and section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.",

        "page_content": "The Audit Committee also regularly monitors our risk management and internal control systems (including internal /financial controls). We aim to have appropriate policies, standards and procedures in place, and ensure that they operate effectively.\n\nAs part of considering the risk management framework, the Committee receives regular reports from the Group /financial controller, the General Counsel and the Head of Tax on material developments in the legal, regulatory and /fiscal landscape in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Board, supported by the Audit Committee, has completed its formal/uni00A0annual review of the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems. This review included consideration of our material /financial, operational and compliance controls. The Board concluded that the Group has an effective system of risk management and internal control.\n\n## Internal control over /financial reporting\n\nThe main features of our internal control and risk management systems in relation to /financial reporting are explained on pages 189-190.\n\n## Internal audit programme structure\n\nGIA provides independent and objective assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems. It also may recommend improvements.\n\nWhile the head of GIA reports administratively to the Chief Financial Of/ficer, appointment to, or removal from, this role requires the consent of the Audit Committee chairman. The head of GIA is accountable to the chairs of both the Audit and the Sustainability Committees, communicates regularly with both, and attends all regular committee meetings. Our GIA team therefore operates independently of management. Their mandate is set out in a written charter, approved by the Audit Committee. GIA uses a formal internal audit methodology, which is consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA's) internationally recognised standards.\n\nWhen needed, the team brings in external partners to help achieve its goals. There is a clear policy to address any con/flicts of interest, which complies with the IIA's standards on independence. This policy identi/fies a list of services which need prior approval from the head of GIA.\n\n## Governance of the annual plan\n\nEach year's internal audit plan is approved by the Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The plan is focused on higher-risk areas and any speci/fic areas or processes chosen by the committees. It is also aligned with any risks identi/fied by the external auditors. Both committees are given regular updates on progress, including any material /findings, and can re/fine the plans as needed.\n\n## Effectiveness of the internal audit programme\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the GIA function throughout the year, with updates on performance at every meeting.\n\nWe are satis/fied that the quality, experience and expertise of GIA is appropriate for the business and that GIA was objective and performed its role effectively. We also monitored management's response to internal audits during the year. We are satis/fied that improvements are being implemented promptly in response to internal audit /findings, and believe that management supports the effective working of the internal audit function.\n\n## Ethics, integrity and the whistleblowing programme\n\nThe business has a long-established ethics programme, known as The/uni00A0Way We Work , supported by a business integrity standard and our whistleblowing programme. The business integrity standard requires employees, core contractors and associates acting for and on behalf of the company to not commit, authorise or be involved in bribery, corruption, fraud and other economic crimes. The whistleblowing programme enables employees, in con/fidence, to raise concerns about possible improprieties.\n\nThe head of Ethics & Integrity reported to the Committee on these matters during 2020. His reports covered a broad range of areas, including ethics, regulatory and compliance issues, and where applicable, any material breaches of The Way We Work , the business integrity standard, and our whistleblower programme.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe Committee reviews its effectiveness annually. In 2020, this was accomplished through an internally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its committees.\n\nThe performance of the Audit Committee was highly rated, with no areas of concern raised and no signi/ficant changes recommended. In terms of improvements, it was agreed that the Committee's programme should continue to develop to ensure an appropriate focus on risk management and risk appetite.\n\n## Climate change-related /financial reporting\n\nThe Directors have considered the relevance of the risks of climate change and transition risks associated with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement when preparing and signing off the company's accounts. The Audit Committee reviews and approves all material accounting estimates and judgments relating to /financial reporting, including those where climate issues are relevant.\n\nClimate change risk is embedded in our central case commodity price forecasts which underpin our accounting judgments and are particularly important in respect to impairment testing and our assessment of mineral reserves and resources. The central case forecasts include carbon price assumptions that are derived from our three scenarios (Realpolitik 2.0, Society 3.0 and Technology 4.0). As only one of these scenarios is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our central case carbon prices are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to meet those goals. Currently, the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy is uncertain and existing climate policies in many countries are not aligned with stated ambitions. The narrative reporting on climate-related matters is consistent with the accounting assumptions and judgments made in this report.",

We did not live up to our values and standards and we must listen and learn from this incident. We are committed to ensuring such an incident never happens again and to rebuilding respectful partnerships with the Traditional Owners of the land on which we operate.\n\nAt our best, we come together as a company to navigate the most signi/ficant challenges successfully. During the COVID-19 pandemic the response of our teams and communities was outstanding. When the pandemic emerged, in early 2020, our management team and our many thousands of employees mobilised to keep our operations running, safely and reliably. We changed rosters, shifts and safety protocols - including instituting rapid testing at key airports in Western Australia - at times, in a matter of days. Our employees and their families received ongoing health and mental health support. We instituted strict protocols to keep vulnerable communities safe. And through it all, we kept our customers supplied with the high-quality products they have come to expect from Rio Tinto.\n\nThis year we also recorded our second straight year of zero fatalities, which is an important milestone in our nearly 150-year history. This Committee commends our thousands of employees and contractors who worked hard to achieve this shared goal. I am also pleased to report that the number of potentially fatal incidents and occupational health illnesses decreased, year over year, and the number of people injured on the job fell by nearly 12%.\n\nWhile we are proud of the safety performance of our teams, we are also focused on continuous improvement. We continue to analyse and learn from actual and potential signi/ficant incidents to prevent them happening again, and our critical risk management (CRM) programme - in which frontline teams verify that fatality prevention controls are in place before starting work - continues to be a key focus in our efforts to prevent an incident or injury occurring. This year over one million veri/fications of controls were made.\n\nWe must deliver strong business performance and earn the trust of our people, the trust of our stakeholders and partners and the trust of society by helping to address global challenges. We are committed to building this trust and will dedicate the required time and resources to achieve this goal.\n\nThe destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge was, for me, profoundly affecting and shameful. I offer my heartfelt apologies to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people as well as to the many others affected, including Traditional Owners and other Indigenous and First Nations people in Australia and globally. I join the Board, the management team and the employees of Rio Tinto in my dedicated commitment to ensure something like this does not happen again.\n\nWe are redoubling our efforts to better manage our relationships with our host communities around the world, and particularly with Traditional Owners in Australia. In November, the Chairman and I met with the board of the PKKP people as well as nine Traditional Owners groups on whose land we operate across the Pilbara, in Western Australia. We listened to the hurt and pain that had been caused by Juukan Gorge and where our partnership relationships needed to be improved. The Board and this Committee are both committed to continuing this dialogue so that the voice and guidance of the Traditional Owners is re/flected in the actions we take to improve, and regain the trust we have lost.",

        "page_content": "Those actions have already begun. This Committee continues its oversight of the implementation of the recommendations made in the Board Review (available in its entirety on riotinto.com). These changes include modernising our agreements with Traditional Owners, increasing the responsibility of our operating units for our Communities and Social Performance (CSP) partnerships and engagement, and establishing a CSP Area of Expertise to support the product groups, and to deliver a more rigorous assurance of our standards across operations. We have also enhanced the controls and governance at our Pilbara iron ore business for the management of activities with potential to impact cultural heritage sites. You can read more about our actions on cultural heritage on pages 10-11.\n\nAnother important change needed, also identi/fied in the Board Review, is culture. By and large, our employees tell us they enjoy their work and their workmates, and the result over the past few years has shown a consistently improving trend in many areas. However, the company would bene/fit from fostering more inclusivity - a culture that is more accepting of challenge and different perspectives from all levels, and importantly, one in which a wider range of voices is at the table, and heard. In this context, we have committed $50 million to develop the required skills and capabilities to increase Indigenous representation and leadership across our business in Australia. We are committed to doing more, and will continue to report on actions and progress.\n\nWith regard to other risks, this year, the Sustainability Committee studied control frameworks that govern risk management for major underground events, major slope geotechnical events and mine closure. We oversaw a review of risk management at joint venture operations not managed by Rio Tinto.\n\nWe also oversaw a review of our control framework for tailings dams and water storage and continued to monitor updates to the Rio Tinto standard and procedure for management of tailings and water storage facilities, as well as updates to the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management, published in August by the Global Tailings Review.\n\nClimate change remains a pressing global challenge, and Rio Tinto remains committed to being part of the transition to a low-carbon future. The Committee supports the Board in its strategic response to climate change and in monitoring the Group's performance against our targets and aspirations. We oversee the work being done with our customers and suppliers, across the value chain, to manage emissions through innovative and focused partnerships.\n\nFinally, as you will see on page 65, this year this Committee oversaw the selection of goals to focus our company's contribution towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our new approach will allow better understanding of how our business can have the most meaningful impact on the biggest challenges faced by society.\n\nAs we look to the future, the Sustainability Committee is committed to provide governance and oversight as Rio Tinto, its management team, employees, contractors and partners together make strides to strengthen the company's sustainability performance, build trust with our people, our partners and stakeholders and build trust with society. As a result we look forward to making an even greater contribution to the health and strength of the countries and communities so many of us call home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMegan Clark\n\nSustainability Committee chair\n\n22 February 2021",

In relation to these important areas we oversee company performance, monitor compliance with company responsibilities and commitments, and review the effectiveness of controls designed to manage the associated risks.\n\nThe Committee has the authority and ability to investigate all matters falling within its terms of reference. These terms of reference are published on the Rio Tinto website, and feature a full list of our responsibilities, which/uni00A0include:\n\n- -Reviewing the Group's relevant policies, and overseeing the management processes designed to ensure compliance with them.\n- -Monitoring management's commitment to the behaviours required by those policies and standards.\n- -Assessing the Group's health, safety, security, environment and Communities and Social Performance framework.\n- -Reviewing reports from management on fatalities and other serious incidents, considering recommendations for improvement, and receiving follow-up reports on their implementation.\n- -Making recommendations to the Board's Remuneration Committee in relation to appropriate metrics for incentive plans for the executive team relating to safety and other applicable sustainable development matters, and the annual performance against those applicable metrics.\n- -Reviewing and approving the proposed annual plan for independent audit and assurance projects within our scope, and reviewing their outcomes and recommendations.\n- -Carrying out a formal review each year of the role and responsibilities of our Committee, its organisation and effectiveness, and its terms of/uni00A0reference.\n\n## Our year in review\n\nWe met six times in 2020, covering a wide range of activities, which are summarised below. In addition, we participated in six roundtables with civil society organisations and investors on sustainability issues. These meetings provided valuable feedback to Rio Tinto.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe Committee receives regular updates through the year in relation to the Group's safety performance across a range of key indicators.\n\nRecognising that we must continue to learn from both actual and potential signi/ficant incidents to prevent them happening again, in 2020 the Committee examined the circumstances leading to, and key learnings from, the following incidents:\n\n- -A potentially fatal incident involving two AutoHaul TM trucks in December 2019 at Yandicoogina, Western Australia;\n- -A potentially fatal underground rock fall in August at the Diavik diamond mine, in the Northwest Territories, Canada; and\n- -An incident in October at Richards Bay Minerals, South Africa, in which an employee suffered a permanent disabling injury.\n\nOther work relating to health and safety undertaken by the Committee this year included:\n\n- -Receiving regular updates on the steps being undertaken to ensure Rio Tinto's employees and contractors remained safe from COVID-19.\n- -Reviewing comparative safety performance data across peer companies.\n- -Receiving a report on Rio Tinto's control framework in relation to underground hazards, including observed incident trends from the major hazard incident tracking programme, and the development of remote assurance capability for the control framework in light of the impacts from COVID-19.\n- -Receiving a report on Rio Tinto's slope geotechnical hazard management and the Group's governance and assurance framework for these risks.\n\n## Environment, including climate change\n\nOur work supporting the Board on environmental and climate change issues has included the following:\n\n- -Reviewing and approving the Group's report 'Our approach to climate change', released in February 2020.\n- -Oversight of the review of our control framework for tailings dams and water storage, and receiving an update on the new Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management.\n- -An update on the Group approach to environmental stewardship, risk-based improvement work and the underlying strategic plan that considers the changing operating environment.\n- -Monitoring progress against our climate change targets, and related projects, partnerships, and physical resilience work.\n- -A brie/fing on a Process Safety Management incident involving a caustic spill at Yarwun Alumina Re/finery, in Queensland, Australia.\n\n## Communities and Social Performance\n\nThe Committee approves annually the Group's Communities and Social Performance plan and priorities, and receives annual updates of progress against the Group's CSP targets.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May/uni00A02020, the Committee has undertaken the following activities:\n\n- -Monitored the work undertaken for the independent Board Review into the destruction of the rock shelters and oversaw the implementation of the recommendations of the Board Review.\n- -Oversaw a review of the controls in place within Rio Tinto Iron Ore for the management of activities with potential to impact cultural heritage sites.\n- -Monitored the joint process to work together with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura People (PKKP) to repair, improve and grow the/uni00A0relationship.",

We have fully integrated responsibility for management of cultural heritage into our mining operations so that our product groups will have primary responsibility for our Communities and Social Performance partnerships and engagement. This means that our mine management in the Pilbara will now be responsible for the relationships with the relevant Traditional Owners. The Area of Expertise team will own the relevant CSP standards and procedures, including in relation to cultural heritage, to ensure our best practices are consistent globally. The Area of Expertise team will also provide the second line of assurance on CSP performance and risks and ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right locations. In addition, our Internal Audit team will provide the third level of assurance in relation to our CSP performance and risks, reporting directly to the Committee.\n\nThe Committee is also receiving ongoing updates on a continuing qualitative review of major CSP risks across the Group.\n\nWe continued to provide oversight of the Group's CSP strategy and/uni00A0performance.\n\nThe Committee has overseen a review of CSP metrics and targets and has reviewed the proposed approach for new targets to be adopted in 2021 and subsequently for 2022-26.\n\nWe supported the Board in its review of the Group's 2019 modern slavery/uni00A0statement.\n\nSome of the initiatives we have overseen in relation to human rights, and the work being done to contribute to our local communities, are set out in the Sustainability section on pages 72-74 and 78 of this report.\n\n## Closure and remediation\n\nWe oversaw a review of the Group's closure strategy, the 2020 closure work plan and the control framework for the management of the risks associated with mine closure planning and implementation.\n\nThe Committee has also reviewed plans for the closure and rehabilitation of the Ranger uranium mine in Northern Territory, Australia, following the cessation of mining and processing activities in January 2021.\n\n## Security\n\nThe Committee's oversight of security included receiving reports on the various security incidents affecting operations at Richards Bay Minerals between November 2019 and January 2020.\n\n## United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nThis year we decided to focus our future contribution on two leading SDGs: responsible consumption and production, and decent work and economic growth. The continual update of our sustainability metrics and targets will help communicate our global support.\n\n## Governance, risk, assurance, executive incentives, and disclosure\n\nEach year, in a joint session with the Audit Committee, we review the Company's risk management and internal controls systems to support the Board's risk disclosures in the Annual Report.\n\nWe also review a selection of the Group's key risks associated with health, safety, security, environment, and Communities and Social/uni00A0Performance.\n\nIn February, the Committee received a report on a review of the effectiveness of Rio Tinto's operating model for the health, safety, environment and security functions implemented through 2018 and 2019. The review included internal stakeholder feedback from site management on the model's implementation. Following further development and re/finement of the operating model during 2020, the Committee received a further presentation in October on the updated model, implementation of which was completed in December.\n\nThe Committee sees transparency as an important part of Rio Tinto's approach to sustainability, and we encourage disclosure of sustainability-related information both proactively and in response to regulatory requirements.\n\nWe reviewed and approved an assessment of the Group's most material sustainability topics to be reported on in the 2020 Annual Report and the Sustainability section of our website. This assessment combines feedback from internal leaders and subject matter experts, and considers stakeholder expectations as well as an analysis of the external environment.\n\nOur other work included:\n\n- -Reviewing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for assurance across the Group's technical risk areas due to the restrictions on travel and on the ability to do assurance on-site.\n- -The management of material risks at Rio Tinto's non-managed joint venture sites.\n- -Receiving a report on assurance process for Major Hazards reviews across the Rio Tinto Group.\n- -Reviewing the 2019 Sustainability Report, the Sustainable development sections of the 2019 Annual Report, and Rio Tinto's 2019 slavery and human traf/ficking statement.\n- -Reviewing the performance outcomes under the Group's 2019 short term incentive plan in relation to safety, and the design for the 2020 safety targets.\n- -Reviewing the approach to short-term incentive ESG and safety targets for/uni00A02021.\n- -Receiving a report on the external assurance programme in relation to the Group's external sustainability reporting, and in relation to the safety performance data supporting the safety performance outcomes under the short term incentive plan.\n- -Reviewing the Committee's scope and responsibilities as re/flected in its terms of reference.\n\nThe Committee participated in a virtual site visit to the Oyu Tolgoi mine and development project in Mongolia, in which we reviewed our community engagement and partnerships.\n\nIn addition, the Committee conducted an evaluation of its processes and performance. Following this review, areas of focus going forward include increasing the number of meetings per year, managing the size of the Committee's agenda to allow due consideration of key issues, and an increased focus on cultural heritage.\n\n## Use of Committee meeting time in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis illustration does not include time spent by the Committee on administrative items or attending site visits.\n\n## Our process\n\nThe Chief Executive; the Group Executive, Safety, Technical & Projects; the Chief Legal, Governance & Ethics Of/ficer; the Head of Risk; and the Global Head of Health, Safety, Environment and Security all regularly attend our meetings.\n\nThe Committee chair reports to the Board after each meeting, and our minutes are tabled before the Board.

The full Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 152-158.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce our 2020 directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nI would like to begin by acknowledging the challenging year we have faced.

The destruction of the rock shelters should not have happened, and we are absolutely committed to listening, learning and changing.\n\nWe have also dealt with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "page_content": "## Juukan Gorge\n\nThis year was one of the most challenging in Rio Tinto's history. The destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters on the land of the PKKP people in Australia should not have happened and it does not re/flect our values as a company.\n\nFollowing the events that occurred at the Juukan Gorge, the Board conducted a review of our cultural heritage management processes, procedures, reporting and governance. The Board's Review published on 24 August 2020 concluded that no single act of commission was responsible for the tragic events that occurred, rather it was the result of a series of systemic failures in the heritage management system over a considerable number of years. The Board concluded that the Chief Executive, Chief Executive Iron Ore and Group Executive Corporate Relations were however ultimately responsible for implementing /fit for purpose management systems and would not therefore receive any 2020 short-term bonus. In addition, for the Chief Executive, a further reduction of \u00a31 million would be applied to the vesting of his 2016 long term incentive plan (LTIP) award.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Board Review on 24 August 2020, the Board engaged extensively with shareholders, Traditional Owners, Indigenous Leaders and other stakeholders. Despite general support for the changes recommended in the Board Review, it became clear that a number of stakeholders felt that the proposed /financial penalties, per se, were insuf/ficient and that to rebuild relationships with the Traditional Owners and other Australian stakeholders, changes of leadership were required to move the company forward. At the conclusion of this intense period of engagement, the Board unanimously concluded that the positions of the three executives had become untenable and initiated discussions to agree mutual separation terms, with executives treated as eligible leavers under the terms of their employment contracts and the LTIP plan rules.\n\nIn making the eligible leaver determination the Board fully recognised the gravity of the destruction at Juukan Gorge but was mindful that the three executives did not deliberately cause the events to happen, they did not do anything unlawful, nor did they engage in fraudulent or dishonest behaviour or wilfully neglect their duties. Without diminishing the signi/ficance of what occurred it was necessary to balance the /findings of the Board Review, the malus adjustments that had been applied and the loss of employment for the three individuals, against the considerable achievements of those executives over many years, in making the /final determination on their separation terms. In this context, the loss of employment was considered the greater sanction.\n\nThe full details of the separation terms for each executive which are in accordance with the Policy and their contractual terms are included on pages 169 and 174.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nWe undertook a thorough review of our current Policy in 2020 as part of which we revisited the merits of restricted stock. We remain of the view that for a long-term cyclical business such as ours restricted stock has some logic. However it was very clear from our discussions with shareholders across different geographies that a signi/ficant proportion still prefer a performance tested long-term programme. We are therefore not proposing signi/ficant changes to the structure of the current Policy at this time.\n\nOverall, the current Policy has served us well but the Committee felt there was scope for simpli/fication and opportunity to align certain aspects more closely to shareholder and broader stakeholder expectations. Key/uni00A0aspects reviewed in detail included the overall quantum and the individual components of the remuneration package in terms of market positioning, the pay mix, executive pensions in the context of the provisions applicable to the broader workforce, and the performance metrics underpinning the short term incentive plan (STIP) and LTIP. As a result, we are proposing some changes which are outlined on pages/uni00A0144-145 which includes an extension of our malus and clawback provisions to cover events that have a material impact on our social licence to operate.\n\nOn appointment as Chief Executive, Jakob Stausholm's pension bene/fit has been set at 14% of salary, which is in line with our new Policy to provide retirement bene/fits consistent with other employees in the Group. Previously, the maximum pension contribution for new appointments was 25% of salary. The weighted average contribution rate for UK and Australian based employees is around 14%. All members of the Executive Committee will be aligned to this level from 2021, except for the Chief Operating Of/ficer who will retain the previous contribution level until his retirement in 2022. The target STIP of the Chief Executive is also being reduced from 120% of base salary to 100% of base salary with the removal of the previous 1.2 multiplier.\n\nA key change proposed to our current Policy is to allocate half of the individual component of STIP (15%) to speci/fic Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics. These will represent a bundle of targets related to our climate change initiatives comprising annual milestones towards the achievement of our 2030 targets, diversity and inclusion to re/flect the communities in which we operate, and governance of our cultural heritage management and other risk-related areas. This proposed change was widely supported in our shareholder consultations this year. It was also clear from the feedback that shareholders want to see meaningful, transparent, quanti/fiable targets which tie to the broader strategy across the ESG dimensions whilst recognising that there are no easy solutions that readily tick all these boxes. Whilst the Committee is fully committed to setting ESG targets that meet most, if not all, of the above criteria, this will be an aspect that we expect to evolve over time. Our 2021 approach to ESG is set out on page 145.\n\nWhile our policy review has con/firmed the appropriateness of our current approach, we will continue to monitor the executive pay debate, as our shareholders would expect. We remain keen to explore any alternate arrangements that simplify remuneration, drive a balanced focus on the short and long-term, align outcomes with Group performance, drive the right behaviours, limit the potential for excessive outcomes, and deliver our objective to attract, retain and appropriately reward talented executives and will continue to engage with shareholders on this subject.\n\n## Chief Executive succession\n\nThe Committee's work this year was also focused on the remuneration implications of our Chief Executive's succession. Jakob Stausholm was appointed Chief Executive effective 1 January 2021. The terms of his appointment announced in December 2020 re/flected the rules of our incentive arrangements and the new Policy that is being put to shareholders at the 2021 AGMs. Fixed pay on appointment was set at \u00a31.311 million per annum, inclusive of base salary of \u00a31.15 million per annum and a pension contribution of 14% base salary. This level of /fixed pay will be a reduction of more than 10% from Jean- S\u00e9bastien Jacques' /fixed pay of \u00a31.467 million per annum. Further information in respect of Jakob Stausholm's remuneration is provided on page 169.\n\n## New executive appointments\n\nThe executives appointed into new roles on the Executive Committee set out on pages 118-119 have all been appointed on terms aligned with the new Policy set out in this Report.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nLike all organisations, Rio Tinto was faced with navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We could not have foreseen the challenges that would arise in 2020, but we continued to perform well and deliver to plan. Our executive team managed a rapid and effective response to COVID-19, without needing to furlough any employees without pay, seeking any government assistance, or cancelling dividends. We were fortunate to remain operating as an essential industry and continued to make a valuable contribution to the communities and economies in which we operate.\n\nThanks to the collective hard work of the entire organisation, we remained focused on our core priorities - the health and safety of our people and communities, the safe running of our operations to serve our customers, the focus on keeping our business and pro/fits strong, maintaining positive partnerships with communities and governments, and above all, staying resilient.",

We now look to the future to use the challenges presented by COVID-19 as an opportunity to strengthen our company and our position in the market even further.\n\n2020 remuneration outcomes in the context of broader business performance\n\n## Short term incentive plan\n\nFinancial performance\n\nIn our At a glance section on page 146, and on page 163, we retrospectively disclose the /financial STIP targets set by the Board for 2020.\n\nTo remind you, in considering /financial performance against the annual plan, we measure half against the original plan; the other half is '/flexed' to exclude the impact of /fluctuations in exchange rates, and quoted metal and other prices during the year, which are outside management's control. We have used this approach consistently since 2005 for measuring our earnings performance, and have /flexed the cash /flow outcomes since the introduction of this measure in the STIP in 2009. When commodity prices rise, or there are favourable exchange rate variations, we protect shareholders by ensuring that 50% of the STIP opportunity (as relates to /financial performance) is denied the bene/fit of that rise. When the reverse happens, and commodity prices fall or there are negative exchange rate variations, that STIP opportunity is safeguarded (as to 50%) against the fall. Our view is that this approach maintains appropriate incentive for executives, even in times of signi/ficant market volatility.\n\nNotwithstanding the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic, the Group's overall /financial performance was very strong, substantially aided by a favourable pricing environment for key commodities. On a /flexed basis, earnings were just below and cash /flow results were above target, while on an un/flexed basis both earnings and cash /flow results exceeded the outstanding range. Together, the outcomes resulted in an unadjusted Group performance against the /financial targets of 77% of maximum. As in prior years the Committee considered whether any adjustments were warranted to ensure the outcome was a fair re/flection of underlying performance. The Committee noted the COVID-19 related expenditure incurred in ensuring our operations continued to run safely which reduced the Group result by 2% but determined not to make any related adjustments or any other adjustments, recognising the impact of the pandemic on business and society globally.\n\n## Safety performance\n\nIn 2020 Rio Tinto achieved its second successive fatality free year. This achievement has been accomplished through leadership commitment to safety, implementation of critical risk management across our operations, increased sharing and analysis of incidents that have the potential to result in a fatality, and the continued implementation of the safety maturity model with its focus on leadership and coaching. Overall, the combined performance against our safety measures meant that the Group's STIP safety result was above target at 74% of maximum and the STIP safety results for all executives were above target.\n\n## 2020 STIP awards\n\nThe 2020 STIP award for Jakob Stausholm is 71.3% of maximum. This includes a personal performance score of 60%, which balances strong leadership and contribution during the year with the events that occurred in 2020. As a result of the malus adjustment, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques will not receive a 2020 STIP award.\n\n## Long term incentive plan\n\nThe estimated vesting for the 2016 award, combining the two TSR and EBIT margin portions, is 66.7% of maximum. In the context of the Group's overall performance during the /five-year performance period and the shareholder experience over that timeframe, the Committee concluded that the vesting of awards was justi/fied. Given Rio Tinto's strong share price performance since the grant of this award, 47% of the estimated vesting value relates to share price appreciation.\n\nThe portion of the award relating to TSR vested on 18 February 2021. The Committee will make a /final determination of the relative improvement in the EBIT margin measure when the /final EBIT margin performance of the comparator group companies becomes available in May 2021. If/uni00A0applicable, this portion of the award will vest on 31 May 2021.\n\nNotwithstanding the substantial malus adjustment applied to Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques which includes a \u00a31 million reduction to his 2016 LTIP vesting, his 2020 single total /figure of remuneration is higher than 2019. This is due to the signi/ficant share price appreciation since grant of the 2016 LTIP and it being the /first award he received in his capacity as Chief Executive. No LTIP award is due to vest for Jakob Stausholm who received his /first award in 2018.\n\n## Pay in the broader context\n\nEach year, the Board looks forward to engaging with our employees all over the world. Over the last several years, the Board has held events with employees across each of our major geographies, complemented by smaller town halls in more remote operating locations to ensure there remains widespread engagement. Much has changed over the past year, but as we respect travel restrictions, physical distancing and other safety measures, the Board's enthusiasm to engage with employees remains as strong as ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us to think and do things differently. The Board has adapted its style of engagement to virtual discussions across a broad range of topics including pay. The/uni00A0Committee remains cognisant of executive pay in the broader context of a post COVID-19 world, ensuring the new Policy re/flects the desired attributes of fairness, transparency, simplicity, proportionality, and/uni00A0alignment to broader organisational culture.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio of 81:1 is primarily driven by the LTIP vesting which ties closely to the shareholder experience over the relevant period which saw TSR increase by 210%.\n\nFairness and genuine care for the health and wellbeing of employees are key pillars of our approach to reward and bene/fits across the Group. These have underpinned the Group-wide response to the pandemic and continue to guide us. Pages 148-149 provide more insight into our approach to reward applicable to the broader employee population.\n\nOur focus on pay equity is evident in our gender pay metrics on which we continue to make progress. Pay equity is a key pillar of our annual remuneration approach. The gender diversity in senior management roles also remains a key aspect of our broad agenda on diversity and inclusion. Further details of both equal pay and the gender pay gap, together with a wider discussion on diversity and inclusion, are provided in the Sustainability Report on pages 75-76.\n\nAs always, I welcome shareholder feedback and comments on the 2020 Remuneration Report.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSam Laidlaw\n\nRemuneration Committee Chairman\n\n22 February 2021",

        "page_content": "## Frequently asked questions\n\n## How does the new Policy ensure remuneration has a strong link to performance?\n\nOutstanding business and individual performance are required to achieve the maximum level of remuneration. This comprises:\n\n- -outstanding performance against /financial, health and safety, and individual STIP measures; and\n- -TSR outperformance against both the EMIX Global Mining and MSCI World indices, currently 6% per annum over /five years.\n\nThe Committee believes that if these levels of performance are achieved, shareholders will bene/fit over time from superior returns.\n\n## How does the new Policy safeguard against reward for failure?\n\nThe Committee retains discretion in relation to all incentive outcomes and can therefore adjust payouts to ensure alignment to performance and shareholder experience.\n\nIncentive awards are also subject to a broad malus, clawback, and suspension policy that provides the Committee with the ability to ensure that there is no payment for failure. We have further expanded this in our new Policy to cover events that materially impact our social licence to operate.\n\n## How did you arrive at a 14% pension contribution level for executives?\n\nThe 14% pension contribution rate is re/flective of the average contribution rate received by our UK and Australian employees.\n\n## How will you ensure that the ESG measures are/uni00A0appropriate?\n\nThe Board is clear on ESG factors that are material to the creation of shareholder value - climate change, cultural/uni00A0heritage and diversity and inclusion. We have identi/fied measures for each of/uni00A0these, but acknowledge that as we undertake this journey, they are likely to be re/fined/uni00A0and improved with experience and adjustments to strategy, as we do with all incentive measures.\n\n## What penalties were applied to executives for the Juukan Gorge event?\n\nAs a consequence of the event, the Chief Executive, Chief Executive Iron Ore and Group Executive Corporate Relations left the company. In addition, the entire 2020 STIP was forfeited by the three executives. The Chief Executive also had a malus adjustment of \u00a31 million applied to his 2016 LTIP.\n\n## What changes have you made to incentive metrics?\n\nThe key change for 2021 has been the introduction of ESG measures into the STIP. These targets are related to our climate change initiatives towards the achievement of our 2030 targets, diversity and inclusion to re/flect our external partnerships and the communities in which we operate, and governance of our cultural heritage management and other risk-related areas.\n\nWhen considered alongside the existing STIP and LTIP measures, the Committee remains satis/fied that the measures are closely aligned with our strategy and meet the criteria of simplicity and fairness.\n\nIn future years, the focus of the measures may need to be adapted to ensure they continue to support long-term value creation. The new Policy therefore enables the Committee to vary metrics for future awards. We would undertake appropriate consultation with our major shareholders prior to making any material changes in our approach.\n\n## Are overall pay levels appropriate?\n\nThe Committee is mindful of setting pay at an appropriate level and continues to be thoughtful in its approach to pay.\n\nThe company operates in a highly competitive and global talent market, and we need to set pay at a level which enables the company to attract and retain high quality people who are capable of managing and growing the business. This is essential to generate superior returns for our shareholders.\n\nWe remain committed to aligning pay with performance. Remuneration levels towards the upper-end of the payout scale are only delivered when justi/fied by outstanding performance. The Committee pays close attention to pay practices in the wider Group, to ensure fairness and consistency in decision making. The Committee also retains the discretion to vary incentive outcomes (including negative adjustments) where they do not fairly re/flect performance.\n\nOverall, the Committee remains comfortable that a fair balance has been struck between pay and performance.",

        "page_content": "## Incorporation of ESG into the Remuneration Policy\n\nThe social and environmental challenges facing the world and our business, together with investor and broader societal expectations and the events at Juukan Gorge, have highlighted the need for Rio Tinto to fully integrate environmental, social and governance ('ESG') performance management into the way we operate across our business.\n\nA key enabler for success is a clear focus on the objectives that directly drive performance across each pillar and we believe that by linking pay outcomes to the achievement of these objectives this focus will be further strengthened. In addition to safety, which makes up 20% of the STIP, from 2021 15% of the STIP will be focused on speci/fic E, S and G objectives. Set out below is the rationale for this change and the broader context within which the 2021 targets (see pages 172-173) have been set.\n\n## Environment\n\nE\n\nS\n\nG\n\nClimate change is one of the key long-term environmental challenges facing us as well as a source of potential opportunities. We must and want to be part of the solution. The targets set are driven from our roadmap to execute against our climate change ambitions. As we are neither able to control nor accurately measure scope 3 emissions, our strategy remains to impact positive change in this area through partnerships focused on the decarbonisation of the value chain.\n\nIn support of the four pillars of our climate change strategy, our focus is on three key dimensions:\n\n- -Strengthen our overall strategic approach to climate change including developing a carbon offset strategy and review of design standards for new projects.\n- -Progress on our emissions and abatement projects.\n- -Progress on our partnerships strategy across our value chain to ensure alignment with our climate change ambition.\n\nPlease refer to 'Our Approach to Climate Change 2020' for more detail.\n\nWe will focus our 2021 'E' component on progressing our emissions and abatement projects and/uni00A0partnerships.\n\n## Social\n\nThe need for us to be re/flective and representative of the communities in which we operate has never been more important. Alongside this, it is imperative that the work environment is one where everyone feels included, respected and heard.\n\nOur aspiration is to have an environment where all aspects and dimensions of diversity are represented and celebrated but we need to focus our efforts to have an impact. Local and indigenous employment is a key priority in each of the countries in which we operate and we continue to have local targets and investment. The nationality diversity of our leadership teams will also become a greater priority.\n\nWe will continue to measure how we evolve our culture and improve inclusion through multiple channels, including our regular people survey. In addition, we are /finding meaningful ways of measuring how the communities in which we operate, our customers and broader stakeholders see us to provide another lens on culture and organisational health.\n\nWe will focus the 2021 'S' component on improving the representation of women. This is a visible diversity that represents half of the population and is currently signi/ficantly underrepresented. Increasing female representation will help create an environment that is better prepared to welcome all other forms of diversity.\n\n## Governance\n\nFollowing publication of the Board Review on Cultural Heritage Management, we developed an action plan (the Trusted Partnership Program - TPP) to address the speci/fic /findings and implement the recommendations of the Board Review. The actions map across a number of topic areas and groupings. Although the TPP seeks to address speci/fically the learnings from Juukan Gorge, with a clear and important focus on Australia, it is part of a Group-wide focus on rebuilding trust and strengthening our communities, partnerships and heritage function and engagement across all of our operations.\n\nFor 2021, we will measure under the 'G' component progress made on a Group level in the social performance function, on assurance and organisation alignment.",

In Australia, we need to report on a wider group of executives, as described in the following paragraph. In addition, as set out in the summary table below, the two reporting regimes follow different methodologies for calculating remuneration.\n\nIn the UK, disclosure is required for the Board, including the executive directors. The Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of 'key management personnel' (KMP), being those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. For the reporting period ended 31 December 2020, our key management personnel are, in addition to the Board, all members of the Executive Committee. This includes the Chief Executive Iron Ore Chris Salisbury who stepped down on 11 September 2020; Ivan/uni00A0Vella (acting Chief Executive Iron Ore) from 15 September 2020, and Steve McIntosh (Group Executive Growth and Innovation) who retired on 30 September 2020.\n\nConsistent with our efforts to simplify and align activities across the Group, and to coincide with the review of our Policy ahead of it being submitted for shareholder approval at our 2021 AGMs, after due consideration the Board has determined effective 1 January 2021 that aside from the Board, including the Chief Executive, our key management personnel comprises the interim Chief Financial Of/ficer, all Product Group Chief Executives, the Chief Commercial Of/ficer and the Group Executive Strategy & Development.\n\nThroughout this Remuneration Report, the members of the Executive Committee are collectively referred to as 'executives'. They are listed on pages 118-119, with details of the positions held during the year and dates of appointment to those roles.\n\n## Structure of our Remuneration Report\n\nWe have included an At a Glance section that summarises key information in one place, resulting in our Remuneration Report being organised into the following parts:\n\nAnnual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |   140 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Remuneration at a Glance                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   144 |\n| Remuneration Policy, which sets out the policy that will  apply from 2021 onwards if approved by shareholders at  our AGMs                                                                                                  |   152 |\n| Implementation Report, which shows how the current Policy  has been applied and new Policy will be applied in 2021,  including tables 1a-3a incorporating additional disclosures  required under the Australian regulations |   159 |\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nAs required under UK legislation, the new Policy will be subject to a binding vote at our 2021 AGMs. The Implementation Report, together with the annual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman, is subject to an advisory vote each year as required by UK legislation. Under Australian legislation, the Remuneration Report as a whole is subject to an advisory vote. All remuneration related resolutions will be voted on at the AGMs as Joint Decision Matters by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders.\n\n## The differing approaches explained\n\nAs well as the difference in methodology for measuring remuneration, there are also key differences in how remuneration is reported in the UK and Australia.\n\n## UK\n\n- -For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into /fixed and variable elements.\n- -We report remuneration in the currency it is paid, for example, where a UK executive is paid in pound sterling, remuneration is reported in pound sterling.\n\n## Australia\n\n- -For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into short and long-term elements.\n- -All remuneration is reported in US dollars, so using the previous example, the UK executives' remuneration would be converted to US dollars using the average exchange rate for the /financial year (except STIP, which is converted at the year end exchange rate).\n- -The table below summarises the elements of each component of remuneration, as well as the signi/ficant differences in the approaches to measurement.\n\n## UK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Variable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term STIP - deferred share element\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Australia",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy\n\n## Remuneration Policy introduction\n\nThis Policy applies to our executive and non-executive directors and to the Chairman. In accordance with Australian law, it also sets out the broad policy principles that apply to members of the Executive Committee who are not directors.\n\nShareholders should note that our Policy is binding only in so far as it relates to directors. The implementation of this Policy for executives who are not directors may therefore vary from that of the executive directors.\n\nIn determining the new Policy the Committee followed a robust process which included multiple discussions regarding the content of the Policy taking into account the needs of the business and evolving market and best practice. The Committee considered input from both management and our independent advisers while ensuring that con/flicts of interest were appropriately managed.\n\nThe overall structure of the new Policy remains broadly unchanged from the Policy previously approved by shareholders in 2018. Updates to the Policy largely re/flect evolving corporate governance and market practice, with minor changes being made to aid the operation of the Policy. These changes include a reduction to pension for new executives to re/flect arrangements operated for the wider employee population, the introduction of an ESG component into STIP and a reduction to the LTIP maximum award level to 400% of salary (from 438%).\n\n## Our remuneration policies, principles and practices\n\nOur values of safety, teamwork, respect, integrity and excellence re/flect who we are and what we stand for as a business. They guide the Committee in its decision making and are foundational to our remuneration-related policies, principles and practices.\n\nOur /first priority is to allocate remuneration resource wisely. We want our pay policies to be regarded as fair by employees and shareholders alike to reward both short and long-term performance and to reinforce the values and collective individual behaviours that drive sustainable performance. Although we believe that our Policy is /fit for purpose, the Committee retains the discretion to override unforeseen and inappropriate mechanistic outcomes.\n\nHigh-quality people, who are capable of managing and growing the business, are essential to generate superior returns for our shareholders. Rio Tinto operates in global and local markets where it competes for a limited pool of talented executives and our remuneration strategy is therefore designed to attract and retain the people that we need. We/uni00A0recognise that remuneration represents just one of the factors that encourage the attraction and retention of talent. We also seek to engage\n\nour employees over the long-term, to foster diversity, and to provide challenging work and development opportunities. Our/uni00A0people strategy is underpinned by our commitment to safety and our other core values of respect, integrity, excellence and teamwork.\n\n## Competitive remuneration linked to performance and shareholder value creation\n\nRemuneration is linked to performance targets over both the short and long-term, to ensure that executive rewards are aligned to the delivery both of short-term priorities and long-term sustainable growth in shareholder value. In order to assess the competitiveness of the packages we offer, we benchmark ourselves against other companies in the FTSE 30 (excluding /financial services companies), which typically have similar global reach and complexity, and other international mining and natural resources companies. The outcomes of these benchmarking exercises form just part of our consideration of the appropriate level of remuneration packages, but we would not expect either base salaries or the expected outcome of our short and long term incentive plans to deviate markedly from the median of these comparator groups. The actual outcome will depend on business and individual performance.\n\nWe take salary increases in the broader employee population into account in determining any change to the base salary of executives and consult with shareholders on the design of our short and long-term incentive plans to ensure that they are aligned with shareholder interests and priorities. We do not formally consult with our employees on the Policy, but approximately 50% of the workforce are shareholders through participation in our employee share plans and therefore have the right to vote on the Remuneration Report. Employees are invited to ask questions or express opinions through our normal employee communications channels.\n\nPerformance under the STIP is measured over one year based on a balanced scorecard including safety, /financial, individual and from 2021 onwards ESG metrics. We recognise the importance of ensuring targets are achieved in the right way and are aligned to the company's values. Therefore in considering STIP outcomes, we also consider the extent to which outcomes are in accordance with our values. 50% of the STIP for executives is delivered in deferred shares that vest after three years.\n\nPerformance under the long term incentive plan (LTIP) is measured over /five years and awards are typically delivered in shares together with cumulative dividends.\n\nOur share ownership policy requires executives to build up and maintain a material shareholding in the company as described in the Implementation Report.\n\n## Alignment with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code principles for developing a remuneration policy have been addressed as follows:\n\n| Principle             | Remuneration Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Clarity               | Our Policy is set out in a fully transparent manner.

This includes a strong focus on long-term success.  Risks include non-/financial risk, such as safety, the environment and heritage protection.

An individual increase may be higher than this in the circumstances described below.\n- -Any increase is generally aligned with the average base salary increases applying to the broader employee population unless there were signi/ficant changes to an individual's role and/or responsibilities during the year. Any increases are determined with reference to underlying Group and individual performance, global economic conditions, role responsibilities, an assessment against relevant comparator groups and internal relativities.\n- -An increase above the maximum noted above may be made in the event of promotion or increase in responsibility or where the executive's base salary is signi/ficantly below market positioning.\n- -Benchmarking is undertaken periodically but not annually, and our intention is to apply judgment in evaluating market data.\n\n## Pension or superannuation\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- -We provide locally competitive post-employment bene/fits in a cost-ef/ficient manner in order to hire and retain.\n\n## Operation\n\n- -Employment bene/fits typically include participation in a pension plan, superannuation fund, or a cash allowance to contribute to a personal pension or superannuation fund, which are aligned with the arrangements for the broader workforce of the country of residence.\n- -The maximum annual bene/fit is set to re/flect the pension arrangements for the wider employee population. This is currently capped at 14% of salary but may be adjusted to re/flect changes in arrangements for the wider employee population.\n\n## Other bene/fits\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- -We provide competitive other bene/fits in a cost-ef/ficient manner in order to hire and retain.\n\n## Operation\n\n- -Other bene/fits may include, but are not limited to, private healthcare cover for the executive and their dependents, life insurance, accident insurance, professional advice, participation in local /flexible bene/fit programmes and certain other minor bene/fits (including modest retirement gifts in applicable circumstances, occasional spouse travel in support of the business, any Rio Tinto business expenses which are deemed to be taxable and any tax the company has paid on their behalf).\n- -Secondment, relocation and localisation bene/fits (for example, housing, tax equalisation, cost of living allowance, periodic visits home for the executive and their family and where relevant, transfer and localisation payments) may also be made to and on behalf of executives living outside their home country.\n- -Other bene/fits are paid at cost and, given the nature and variety of the items, there is no formal maximum level of company contribution.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements - Performance-related (At risk)\n\n## Short term incentive plan (STIP)\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- -STIP focuses participants on achieving demanding annual performance goals, which are based on the Group's priorities, in pursuit of the creation of sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n- -We demand that sustainable business practices are adhered to, particularly in the context of safety and ESG.\n- -We consider the individual performance of our executives against our values. The way we work outlines how we deliver both our purpose and strategy. It makes clear how all employees should behave, in accordance with our values of safety, team work, respect, integrity and excellence.\n\n## Operation\n\n- -Nil award for threshold performance and 100% for outstanding. Between threshold and outstanding, the award is normally pro-rated on a straight line basis between these points.\n- -The maximum award is capped at 200% of base salary for all executives. Any outcome from the formulaic STIP calculation is subject to the exercise of discretion by the/uni00A0Committee.\n- -A scorecard based on the Group's priorities is established for each executive at the commencement of the /financial year. The measures and the relative weightings are selected by the Committee in order to drive business performance for the current year, including the achievement of /financial, safety, ESG and other individual business outcomes that are priorities for the /financial year in question. At least 50% of the measures will relate to /financial performance and a signi/ficant component will relate to safety performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the area of /financial and individual goals, we will, at the beginning of each year, disclose the measures and weightings only, because we regard the targets as commercially sensitive. However, we intend to disclose these targets and outcomes retrospectively.\n- -In making its year-end determination of STIP awards, the Committee seeks to ensure that actual performance is directly comparable to the targets set at the beginning of the year. This may result in adjustments to the targets or to the assessed results being made by the Committee (in particular to take account of events outside management's control), to ensure a like-for-like comparison. Both upward and downward adjustments can be made, with reference to principles agreed by the Committee, to ensure the outcomes are fair.\n- -Safety KPIs comprise a signi/ficant portion of the STIP for executives, and any fatality will have a material impact on the STIP result for all executives.\n- -Malus, clawback and suspension provisions that apply are set out later in the Policy.\n\n## Bonus deferral\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- -Ensures ongoing alignment between executives and shareholders through deferral of part of the STIP award into Rio Tinto shares.\n\n## Operation\n\n- -Normally 50% of the STIP is delivered in bonus deferred shares (known as a Bonus Deferral Award (BDA)) with the remainder delivered in cash with no deferral.\n- -BDAs normally vest in the December of the third year after the end of the STIP performance year to which they relate.\n- -Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any BDA that vest.\n- -Where permitted by the plan rules, and where the Committee so decides, awards may be made or satis/fied in cash in lieu of shares. Awards are normally, but not exclusively, granted with an intention to settle in shares.\n- -BDAs vest on a change of control.\n- -Malus, clawback and suspension provisions that apply are set out later in the Policy.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements - Performance-related (At risk)\n\n## Performance Share Awards (PSA) under the long term incentive plan (LTIP) Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- -PSAs are designed to provide a simple and transparent mechanism for aligning executive reward with the execution of an effective business strategy that delivers superior long-term shareholder returns.\n- -Award levels are set to provide substantive focus on and reward long-term performance. PSAs are the most signi/ficant component within the remuneration package and are calibrated so as to ensure the overall competitiveness of the remuneration package.\n\n## Operation\n\n- -PSAs are conditional share awards (or economic equivalent) that vest subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions and continued employment.\n- -The Committee will set performance conditions aligned with the Group's long term strategic objectives for each PSA grant. Relative TSR has been chosen as the current measure of long-term performance as it provides an objective external assessment over a sustained period on a basis that is familiar to shareholders. Whilst we expect TSR will remain a key performance metric, the Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance measures and weightings as appropriate. For the 2021 awards, there is no intention to make any adjustments to the two TSR performance metrics and their weighting.\n- -PSA are normally only released after /five years. Currently awards are subject to a /five-year performance period.\n- -Awards have a maximum face value of 400% of base salary which is currently determined using the average share price of the prior /financial year. Actual annual award levels may vary for each executive.\n- -Threshold performance would result in the vesting of up to 22.5% of the face value of an award.\n- -Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any PSA that vest.\n- -Where permitted by the plan rules, and where the Committee so decides, awards may be made or satis/fied in cash in lieu of shares. Awards are normally, but not exclusively, granted with an intention to settle in shares.\n- -Awards and performance conditions may be adjusted to take account of variations of share capital and other transactions. Subject to this Policy, performance conditions may also be amended in other circumstances if the Committee considers that a changed performance condition would be a fairer measure of performance.\n- -If there is a change of control, awards will vest to the extent performance conditions are then satis/fied. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, if the change of control happens during the /first 36 months from the date of grant of the award, the number of shares that can vest will be reduced pro rata. The Committee may, alternatively, with agreement of an acquiring company, replace a PSA with equivalent new awards over shares in the acquiring company.\n- -The Committee retains the discretion, where circumstances warrant, to amend performance conditions under the relevant plan rules. The Committee will seek to ensure that outcomes are fair and that they take account of the overall performance of the company during the performance period.\n- -Malus, clawback and suspension provisions apply (see page 154).",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy\n\n## continued\n\n## Shareholding guidelines\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- -Shareholding guidelines align executives' interests with those of shareholders.\n\n## Operation\n\n- -The Group understands the importance of and expects executives to build up and maintain a material shareholding in Rio Tinto. Executives should aim to reach a share ownership (de/fined below) in Rio Tinto shares equivalent in value to:\n\n## Chief Executive\n\n4 x base salary\n\n## Other executives\n\n3 x base salary for the Chief Financial Of/ficer and up to 3 x base salary for other executives.\n\n- -The Committee generally expects executives to build up their shareholding over a /five-year period. Longer periods may be accepted for new appointments, given the /five-year vesting period for the PSA.\n- -Shares are treated as 'owned' if they are not subject to restriction (e.g. additional performance conditions), which includes shares directly held by an executive and any shares where there is a bene/ficial interest. A bene/ficial interest includes any shares for which an executive receives the bene/fit of ownership (such as a right to receive dividends) without directly owning the shares. Given its mandatory nature and the absence of performance conditions, a value for unvested BDA is included with a 50% discount for the likely effects of taxation.\n- -Executive directors are expected to continue to meet the share ownership policy for two years after stepping down from the Board (or if the holding requirement is not met at this date, the relevant holding at the time). When considered alongside the existing leaver provisions for share awards, this will ensure that executive directors will remain aligned with shareholders for an extended period after ceasing employment.\n- -The Committee retains the discretion to enforce shareholding requirements through the application of malus to unvested share awards and/or scale back of future grants.\n\n## Malus, clawback and suspension\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Malus', 'clawback' and 'suspension' provisions will apply to STIP and LTIP awards.\n\nUnder both the 'malus' and 'clawback' provisions, where the Committee determines that exceptional circumstances exist, the Committee may, at its discretion, reduce the number of shares to be received on vesting of an award, or, for a period of two years after the vesting of an award, the Committee can clawback value from a participant.\n\nThe circumstances under which the Committee exercises such discretion may include, inter alia:\n\n- -any fraud or misconduct by a participant or an exceptional event which has had, or may have, a material effect on the value or reputation of any member of the Group (excluding an exceptional event or events which have a material adverse effect on global macroeconomic conditions).\n- -an error in the Group's /financial statements which requires a material downward restatement or is otherwise material or where information has emerged since the award date which would have affected the size of award granted or vested.\n- -where the Committee determines that the personal performance of a participant, of their product group or of the Group does not justify vesting or where the participant's conduct or performance has been in breach of their employment contract, any laws, rules or codes of conduct applicable to them or the standards reasonably expected of a person in their position.\n- -the performance of the company, business or undertaking in which a participant worked or works or for which he or she was or is directly or indirectly responsible is found to have been misstated or based upon any material misrepresentation and which resulted in the award being granted and/or vesting over a greater number of shares than would otherwise have been the case.\n- -where any team, business area, member of the Group or pro/fit centre in which the participant works or worked has been found guilty in connection with any regulatory investigation or has been in breach of any laws, rules or codes of conduct applicable to it or the standards reasonably expected of it.\n- -where the Committee determines that there has been material damage to the Group's social licence to operate.\n- -a catastrophic safety or environmental event or events occurring in any part of the Group.\n\nUnder the suspension provisions, the Committee may suspend the vesting of an award (for up to /five years) until the outcome of any internal or external investigation is concluded and may then reduce or lapse the participant's award based on the outcome of that investigation. Note that where suspension applies, the 24-month clawback period will not extend beyond the period commencing from the original vesting date.\n\n## Discretion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that the outcomes of the Group's executive pay arrangements described in this Policy properly re/flect the Group's overall performance and risk appetite.\n\nThe Committee therefore reserves the right to review all remuneration outcomes arising from mechanistic application of performance conditions and to exercise discretion to make adjustments where such outcomes do not properly re/flect underlying performance or the experience of shareholders or other stakeholders.\n\nThe Committee may at its discretion adjust and/or set different performance measures if events occur (such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition or divestment, a catastrophic safety or environmental incident, a change in control or other unexpected event) which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate or in the best interests of shareholders or other stakeholders, and that amendment is required so that the measures, as far as possible, achieve their original purpose. Such discretion will be exercised judiciously and clearly disclosed and explained in the Implementation Report.\n\nAny discretionary adjustments for directors will be disclosed in the Implementation Report for the relevant /financial period.",

compensation provided to an executive recruited from outside the Group for the  forfeiture of remuneration arrangements on joining is considered separately to the  establishment of forward-looking annual remuneration arrangements. Our policy with  respect to such 'buy-outs' is to determine a reasonable level of award, on a like-for-like  basis, consisting primarily of equity-based awards, but also potentially cash, taking into  consideration the quantum of forfeited awards, their performance conditions and vesting  schedules. The Committee will obtain an independent external assessment of the value  of awards proposed to be bought out and retains discretion, subject to the considerations  noted above, to make such compensation as it deems necessary and appropriate to  secure the relevant executive's employment. The Committee's intention is that buy-out  compensation should include, where appropriate, performance conditions and equivalent  time frames for release. |\n| Relocation-related support                                    | If the Committee concludes that it is necessary and appropriate to secure an  appointment, relocation-related support and international mobility bene/fits may be  provided depending on the circumstances and in line with the Group's broader approach.

In exceptional circumstances, an initial notice period of up to 24 months during the /first two years of employment, reducing to up to 12 months thereafter, may be necessary to secure an external appointment. In some circumstances, it may also be appropriate to use /fixed-term contracts for executive/uni00A0directors.\n\nOther executives are offered service contracts which can be terminated by the company with up to 12 months' notice in writing, and by the employee with either six or up to 12 months' notice in writing.\n\nThe contracts for executives include appropriate non-compete and restrictive covenants.\n\nThe current contract terms of directors and the other executives are included in the Implementation Report. The letters of appointment are available for inspection at Rio Tinto plc's registered of/fice, and at its AGM.\n\nExecutives may be required to go on 'garden leave' during all or part of their notice period and may receive their base salary, STIP and other bene/fits during the notice period (or the cash equivalent). Where applicable, tax equalisation and other expatriate bene/fits will continue in accordance with the executive's prevailing terms and conditions.\n\nIf termination is a result of redundancy, the terms of the relevant local policy or practice will apply in the same way as for other local employees.\n\nThe STIP and LTIP rules govern the entitlements that executives may have under those plans upon termination of employment.\n\nThe concept of an 'eligible leaver' is de/fined in the relevant plan rules. In general terms, an eligible leaver is an executive who leaves the Group by reason of ill-health; injury; disability (as determined by the executive's employer); retirement with company consent; redundancy; transfer of the undertaking in which the executive works; change of control of the executive's employing company; or death. In addition, the plan rules afford discretion to the Committee to award eligible leaver status in other circumstances.\n\nIn the case of dismissal for cause, the company can terminate employment without notice and without payment of any salary or compensation in lieu of notice. Outstanding awards under any of the Group's long term incentive plans may be forfeited in these circumstances.",

Otherwise, his or her appointment may be terminated by giving 12 months' notice. Accrued fees will be paid up to the termination date with the exception of dismissal for cause. The Committee has the discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice if the Chairman is not required to serve his or her full 12 months' notice. If the appointment as Chairman is terminated by reason of their removal as a director pursuant to a resolution of shareholders in general meeting, the company shall be liable to pay any fees accrued to the date of any such removal.\n\nThe non-executive directors' letters of appointment from the company stipulate their duties and responsibilities as directors. Each non-executive director is appointed subject to their election and annual re-election by shareholders. Non-executive directors' appointments may be terminated by either party giving three months' notice. There are no provisions for compensation payable on termination of their appointment. The letters of appointment are available for inspection at Rio Tinto plc's registered of/fice.\n\nThe maximum aggregate fees payable to the non-executive directors (including the Chairman) in respect of any year, including fees received by the non-executive directors for serving on any committee of the Board, will not exceed the limits set out in the Group's constitutional documents (currently \u00a33 million).",

The information is shown gross of tax and in US dollars. The remuneration details in table 1a include accounting values relating to various parts of the remuneration package, most notably PSAs granted under the Group's LTIP arrangements, and require a different methodology for calculating the pension value. The /figures in the single total /figure of remuneration table are therefore not directly comparable with those in table 1a. Where applicable, amounts have been converted using the relevant average exchange rates included in the notes to table 1a.\n\nIn table 1b on page 178, we report the remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive directors.\n\nCertain information contained within the Remuneration Report is audited, as outlined on page 185.\n\n## Remuneration Committee responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities are set out in our terms of reference, which we review each year, and are published in the corporate governance section of the Rio Tinto website. Our responsibilities include:\n\n- -Determining the Group's remuneration structure and policies, and assessing their cost, including pension and superannuation arrangements for executives.\n- -Determining the mix and use of short and long-term incentive plans for executives and ensuring alignment with the company's strategic objectives.\n- -Overseeing the operation of the Group's short and long-term incentive plans for executives, including approving awards, setting performance criteria, and determining any vesting.\n- -Determining contractual notice periods and termination commitments, and setting retention and termination arrangements for executives.\n- -Determining awards under the Group's all-employee share plan.\n- -Monitoring gender pay.\n- -Determining the terms of service upon appointment for the Chairman and executives, and any subsequent changes.\n\nWe consider the level of pay and conditions for all employees across the Group when determining executive remuneration.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nThe members of the Committee during the year and to the date of this report were:\n\nSam Laidlaw (Chairman)\n\nMegan Clark\n\nSimon McKeon\n\nJennifer Nason\n\n(from 1 March 2020)\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nNgaire Woods\n\n(from 1 September 2020)\n\n## How we work\n\nThe Group Company Secretary attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive, Group Executive Human Resources and Head of Reward attend appropriate parts of the meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee. No individual is in attendance during discussions about their own remuneration.\n\n## Independent advisers\n\nThe Committee has a protocol for engaging and working with remuneration consultants to ensure that 'remuneration recommendations' (being advice relating to the elements of remuneration for key management personnel, as de/fined under the Australian Corporations Act) are made free from undue in/fluence by key management personnel to whom they may relate. We monitored compliance with these requirements throughout 2020. Deloitte gave declarations to the effect that any remuneration recommendations were made free from undue in/fluence by key management personnel to whom they related, and the Board has received assurance from the Committee and is satis/fied that this was the case.\n\nDeloitte, the appointed advisers to the Committee, are members of the Remuneration Consultants' Group, and voluntarily operate under its Code of Conduct (the Code) in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and con/fidentiality. Deloitte have con/firmed that they adhered to the Code throughout 2020 for all remuneration services provided to Rio Tinto. The Code is available online at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.",

During 2020, Deloitte's services also included attending Committee meetings, support on the new Policy and giving advice in relation to management proposals. Deloitte was paid US$268,394 (2019: US$53,164) for these services. Fees were charged on the basis of time and expenses incurred, including work done regarding the new Policy.\n\nWillis Towers Watson provided general and technical executive remuneration services. These services predominantly related to remuneration of employees other than key management personnel. We received other services and publications relating to remuneration data from a range of sources. During the year Deloitte also provided internal audit, tax compliance and other non-audit advisory services. These services were provided under separate engagement terms and the Committee is satis/fied that there were no con/flicts of interest.\n\n## How the Committee spent its time in 2020\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee met eight times.

Our key objectives for the performance review process are to:\n\n- -Improve organisational effectiveness by creating alignment between the executive's objectives and Rio Tinto's strategy.\n- -Provide a consistent, transparent and balanced approach to measure, recognise and reward executive performance.\n\nThe Chief Executive conducts the review for members of the Executive Committee, and recommends the performance outcomes to the Committee. The Chief Executive's performance is assessed by the Chairman of the Board and discussed and debated with the Committee and the full Board. Performance reviews for all executives took place in 2020 or early 2021.",

The Committee noted the COVID-19 related expenditure incurred in ensuring our operations continued to run safely which reduced the Group result by 2% but determined not to make any related adjustments, recognising the broader impact of the pandemic on the Group's operating and /financial performance in the year.\n\nIn accordance with our adjustment principles, the Committee considered the write-down of deferred tax assets in the Alcan Australia tax group which was recognised by the Aluminium product group in the year. The write-down results from a review in the year of the long term prospects for recovery of these deferred tax assets and did not result from operating performance or market conditions in 2020. An adjustment was therefore proposed to neutralise the impact of this write down on 2020 STIP outcomes.\n\nThe Committee determined that the adjustment was warranted but should only be applied to the Aluminium product group result, with no impact on the Group results. Consequently, the Group's /financial results for the year remained at an unadjusted 77% of maximum.\n\nResult\n\n(% of maximum)\n\nWeighted result\n\nCommentary on\n\nindividual measures",

This is due to the reporting timeframes for companies in the EBIT margin comparator group and the time taken for the external source (currently S&P Capital IQ) to report the relevant data.\n\nAccordingly, the value of the shares vesting included in the single total /figure of remuneration table for 2020 is an estimate, which is /finalised once the actual /figures are known. The original estimate is based on:\n\n- -The TSR portion of the award (with estimated associated dividend equivalent shares) which vest in February following the end of the /five-year performance period.\n- -An estimate of vesting of the EBIT margin portion of the award (with estimated associated dividend equivalent shares) based on the analysis of the latest available EBIT margin ranking prior to publication of this report.\n- -The average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over the last quarter of the relevant year, as the share price on the date of which all shares vest is not ascertainable by the date on which the Remuneration Report is approved by the Board.\n\nThe actual values associated with the LTIP vesting are determined following the vesting of the EBIT margin portion of the award at the end of the following May based on the actual share prices on the date of vesting. The estimated LTIP values are then restated, if applicable, in the following Remuneration Report, as shown below for the 2015 PSA:\n\n|                     |                                      | Estimated   | Estimated                         | Estimated          | Estimated                                   | Estimated     | Estimated             | Actual                              | Actual                         | Actual                                          | Actual                         |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Executive director  | Year   included   in single  /figure | Award       | EBIT margin   rank out  of 11 (b) | Overall  vesting % | Shares,  (including  dividend  equivalents) | Share   price | LTIP outcome  (\u00a3'000) | EBIT   margin   rank out  of 11 (c) | Overall  vesting %             | Share   price                                   | LTIP   outcome  (\u00a3'000)        |\n| Jean-               |                                      |             |                                   |                    | 136,255                                     |               |                       |                                     |                                |                                                 |                                |\n| S\u00e9bastien   Jacques | 2020 (a)                             | 2016 PSA    | 6th rank                          | 66.67%             | (26,942)                                    | \u00a349.38        | 5,728 (d)             | Will be determined in May 2021      | Will be determined in May 2021 | Will be determined in May 2021                  | Will be determined in May 2021 |\n| S\u00e9bastien   Jacques | 2019                                 | 2015 PSA    | 4th rank                          | 67.9%              | 62,117 (12,691)                             | \u00a342.04        | 2,611                 | 3rd rank                            | 75.98%                         | \u00a337.16 for TSR element  \u00a343.72 for EBIT element | 2,814                          |\n\nJakob Stausholm's /first LTIP award was made in September 2018, with a performance period ending 31 December 2022.",

The remaining third is based on the improvement in EBIT margin relative to the comparator group.\n\nThe effect of this performance on the value of shareholdings, as measured by TSR delivered over the past /five years, based on the sum of dividends paid and share price movements during each calendar year, is detailed in the table below.\n\n|      | Dividends paid  during the year   | Share price -   Rio Tinto plc pence   | Share price -   Rio Tinto plc pence   | Share price -   Rio Tinto Limited A$   | Share price -   Rio Tinto Limited A$   | Total  shareholder  return (TSR)   |\n|------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Year | US cents per  share               | 1 Jan                                 | 31 Dec                                | 1 Jan                                  | 31 Dec                                 | Group %                            |\n| 2016 | 152.5                             | 1,980                                 | 3,159                                 | 44.71                                  | 59.90                                  | 41.4%                              |\n| 2017 | 235.0                             | 3,159                                 | 3,942                                 | 59.90                                  | 75.81                                  | 43.8%                              |\n| 2018 | 307.0                             | 3,942                                 | 3,730                                 | 75.81                                  | 78.47                                  | (4.4%)                             |\n| 2019 | 635.0                             | 3,730                                 | 4,503                                 | 78.47                                  | 100.40                                 | 38.5%                              |\n| 2020 | 386.0                             | 4,503                                 | 5,470                                 | 100.40                                 | 113.83                                 | 33.9%                              |\n\nThe data presented in this table re/flects the dual corporate structure of Rio Tinto.

The estimated outcome for the 2015-2019 performance period, reported in the 2019 Annual Report of 67.9%, has been restated with the actual outcome of 76.0% The overall vesting level for the 2016-2020 performance period is an estimate based on the estimated EBIT margin outcome.\n\n| Performance period   | Vesting year   |   % of award  vested |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| 2013-16              | 2017           |                 50.5 |\n| 2013-17              | 2018           |                 66.7 |\n| 2014-18              | 2019           |                 43   |\n| 2015-19              | 2020           |                 76   |\n| 2016-20              | 2021           |                 66.7 |\n| Average vesting      | -              |                 60.6 |\n\n## Past-director payments\n\nAs previously disclosed, in light of the ongoing investigations by regulators in relation to the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, a deed of deferral was mutually agreed between Rio Tinto and the former Chief Executive, Sam Walsh, as a matter of good corporate governance. The principal provision of this deed was that his incentive plan awards, which would have otherwise vested up to 2021, would be subject to a three-stage deferral.\n\nFollowing an independent con/fidential and binding dispute resolution process, a determination was made that the /first-stage deferral, which would have been payable on 31 December 2018 together with associated dividends and interest, should be paid to Sam Walsh. In accordance with this decision, an amount of A$7,304,309, less statutory deductions, was paid to him on 13 March 2020.\n\nIn light of the decision taken under the binding dispute resolution, combined with no further material information having emerged, the Board concluded that Sam Walsh should receive the second-stage deferral, payable on 31 December 2020 together with associated dividends and interest. Accordingly, he received payment of a further A$17,574,205, less statutory deductions, on 31 December 2020.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of his retirement arrangements and deed of deferral, and continued trailing tax compliance obligations, Sam Walsh continued to receive personal tax compliance services. The total gross cost of these services in 2020 was A$33,897.\n\nA /final disclosure with respect to the third-stage deferral will be made in the 2021 directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## Loss of of/fice payments\n\nJean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques stepped down from his role as an executive director and Chief Executive on 1 January 2021. He will remain on garden leave until 31 March 2021 and receive his base salary and contractual bene/fits including bene/fits-in-kind and pension (contributions or cash allowance in lieu) up to his termination date. He is eligible to receive payments of \u00a3519,000 in lieu of his remaining unworked notice of approximately /five months which will be paid in monthly instalments and remain subject to mitigation. He will also receive payment of \u00a3215,000 for statutory accrued and unused annual and long service leave in line with relevant legislation and policy. Outstanding LTIP awards will be treated in accordance with eligible leaver provisions of each plan and in accordance with our Policy, with pro-rating for service where applicable, up to 31 March 2021. All LTIP awards will vest on their normal vesting dates with the PSAs remaining subject to achievement of applicable performance conditions. Under the terms of his settlement agreement, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques must comply with a two year post-employment holding requirement.\n\n## Incoming director remuneration\n\nJakob Stausholm was appointed as the Chief Executive effective 1 January 2021.\n\nThe remuneration package offered to the new Chief Executive has been aligned with the new Policy and is comprised of the following elements:\n\n- -A base salary of \u00a31,150,000. The next salary review will be in March 2022.\n- -Target STIP opportunity of 100% of base salary (with a maximum opportunity of 200% of base salary).\n- -LTIP award of up to 400% of base salary.\n- -A reduced company pension contribution of 14% of base salary.\n- -Other bene/fits include company provided health-care coverage, and continued eligibility to participate in the all-employee share plans.\n- -A minimum shareholding requirement of 400% of base salary (including a two-year post-employment holding requirement) applies.\n\n## Chief Executive pay ratio\n\nThe ratio of the total remuneration of the Chief Executive to the median total remuneration of all Rio Tinto employees for 2020 was 81:1 (2019: 68:1, restated for actual 2015 PSA vesting). This has been calculated using the single total /figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive (\u00a37.22 million) and the median employee in the Group (c.\u00a390,000).\n\nThe ratio is primarily driven by the percentage of total remuneration that is performance related and re/flects the increased LTIP vesting outcomes for 2020 compared to 2019. This further demonstrates the alignment to the shareholder experience as measured by total shareholder return. The/uni00A0Committee continues to be mindful of the relationship between executive remuneration and that of our broader workforce. The Committee's decision making will continue to be supported by regular and detailed reporting on these matters.\n\nAs the company employs fewer than 250 employees in the UK, this analysis has been provided on a voluntary basis.",

All other fees are subject to review by the Board on the recommendation of the Chairman's Committee.\n\nThe Chairman's Committee conducted a review of non-executive director fees in November 2020. Following this review, it was determined that all fees and travel allowances should remain unchanged.\n\nThe additional \u00a310,000 allowance for eligible Australian directors is to compensate them for additional UK National Insurance contributions which, unlike directors based in other jurisdictions, they are not able to offset against their local tax payments.\n\nWe set out details of each element of remuneration, and the single total /figure of remuneration, paid to the Chairman and non-executive directors during 2020 and 2019 in US dollars in table 1b on page 178. No post-employment, termination or share-based payments were made. Statutory minimum superannuation contributions for non-executive directors are deducted from the director's overall fee entitlements when these are required by Australian superannuation law.\n\nThe total fee and allowance payments made to the Chairman and non-executive directors in 2020 are within the maximum aggregate annual amount of/uni00A0\u00a33 million set out in the Group's constitutional documents, approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGMs.\n\n## Share ownership policy for non-executive directors\n\nRio Tinto has a policy that encourages non-executive directors to build up a shareholding equal in value to one year's base fee within three years of their appointment. Details of non-executive directors' share interests in the Group, including total holdings, are set out in table 2 on page 179.\n\n## Non-executive directors' share ownership\n\nThe non-executive directors' shareholdings are calculated using the market price of Rio Tinto shares on the latest practicable date before this report was published (5 February 2021):\n\n| Director           | Share ownership level at  31 December 2020 as a multiple of  base fee (or Chairman's fee)   | Share ownership level at  31 December 2019 as a multiple of  base fee (or Chairman's fee)   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Simon Thompson     | 4.4 (0.6)                                                                                   | 3.3 (0.4)                                                                                   |\n| Megan Clark        | 3.9                                                                                         | 2.9                                                                                         |\n| David Constable    | 1.5                                                                                         | 1.1                                                                                         |\n| Hinda Gharbi       | 0.9                                                                                         | -                                                                                           |\n| Simon Henry        | 0.9                                                                                         | 0.2                                                                                         |\n| Sam Laidlaw        | 4.4                                                                                         | 3.3                                                                                         |\n| Michael L'Estrange | 1.9                                                                                         | 1.5                                                                                         |\n| Simon McKeon       | 6.1                                                                                         | 5.0                                                                                         |\n| Jennifer Nason     | 1.1                                                                                         | -                                                                                           |\n| Ngaire Woods       | -                                                                                           | -                                                                                           |",

Some ESG-related aspects were previously embedded within the 30%-weighted individual component. From 2021 onwards, this has been split into a standalone ESG component of 15% and a reduced individual component of 15%. The individual component will continue to re/flect key objectives set across our strategic pillars, which for the Chief Executive will include objectives related to evolving the organisational culture.\n\nThe /financial and individual targets that have been set for 2021 are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive. As such, the speci/fic targets for these measures, and the performance against them, are expected to be described retrospectively in the 2021 Implementation Report. The Group /financial targets relate to underlying earnings and free cash /flow.\n\n## 2021 ESG measures, weightings and targets\n\nThe ESG challenge is complex and evolving. The insight gained during the consultations with investors on the Policy and via other channels on this topic was helpful in /finalising our approach for 2021. Given the long-term nature of many of the ESG challenges and the focus and stability needed to mobilise our company and teams effectively across the different aspects of ESG, the Committee considered carefully whether to incorporate ESG metrics into the long-term incentives. In the context of evolving expectations as to what good looks like and the desire to set meaningful, transparent and measurable targets, on balance, the Committee decided to further embed ESG in the short-term incentive.\n\nAs we gain experience and improve our ability to set targets across the three ESG pillars and measure progress, we may replace and/or amend ESG metrics and targets included in the STIP in future years. Other ESG related objectives outside of STIP will continue to be actively managed and may form part of business leaders' individual performance objectives. In selecting the focus areas and metrics for the ESG component, we have been conscious and mindful of the need to set credible stretch targets aligned to our strategic agenda that are transparent and measurable whilst recognising some inevitable limitations of what is possible.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The change to the portfolio meant that the role of Group Executive, Corporate Relations was going to be restructured. As a result, Simone Niven stepped down from the Executive Committee, and left the Group on 31 December 2020. Until this date, she received her base salary and contractual bene/fits including bene/fits-in-kind and pension (contributions or cash allowance in lieu) up to her termination date.

        "page_content": "## Other share plans\n\n## All employee share plans\n\nThe Committee believes that all employees should be given the opportunity to become shareholders in our business, and that share plans help engage, retain and motivate employees over the long-term. Rio Tinto's share plans are therefore part of its standard remuneration practice, to encourage employee share ownership and create alignment with the shareholder experience. Executives may participate in broad-based share plans that are available to Group employees generally and to which performance conditions do not apply.\n\nA global employee share purchase plan is normally offered to all eligible employees unless there are local jurisdictional restrictions. Under the plan, employees may acquire shares up to the value of US$5,000 (or equivalent in other currencies) per year, or capped at 10% of their base salary if lower. Each share purchased will be matched by the company, providing the participant holds the shares, and is still employed, at the end of the three-year vesting period.\n\nApproximately 22,000 (50%) of our employees are shareholders as a result of participating in these plans. In the UK, these arrangements are partially delivered through the UK Share Plan which is a UK tax approved arrangement. Under this plan, eligible participants may also receive an annual award of Free Shares up to the limits prescribed under UK tax legislation.\n\n## Management Share Awards (MSA)\n\nThe MSA are designed to help the Group attract the best staff in a competitive labour market, and to retain key individuals as we deliver our long-term strategy. MSA are conditional awards that are not subject to a performance condition. They vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment. Shares to satisfy the awards are bought in the market or re-issued from treasury. Executive Committee members are not eligible for the MSA after appointment.\n\n## Dilution\n\nAwards under the 2013 Performance Share Plan, the 2018 EIP and all employee plans may be satis/fied by, in the case of Rio Tinto plc, treasury shares or the issue of new shares or the purchase of shares in the market. In the case of Rio Tinto Limited, the plans are satis/fied by the purchase of shares in the market and can be satis/fied by the issue of new shares.\n\nIn the UK, the Investment Association has issued corporate governance guidelines in relation to the amount of new shares that may be issued having regard to the total issued share capital. Under the guidelines, the rules of a scheme must provide that commitments to issue new shares or reissue treasury shares, when aggregated with awards under all of a company's other schemes, must not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling ten-year period.\n\nFurthermore, commitments to issue new shares or reissue treasury shares under executive (discretionary) schemes should not exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of a company (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling ten-year period. This may be exceeded where vesting is dependent on the achievement of signi/ficantly more stretching performance criteria. Rio Tinto plc is in compliance with these guidelines. As at 31 December 2020 these limits had not been exceeded.\n\nIn Australia, as a condition of relief from prospectus requirements, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has imposed a cap on the issue of shares to employees of 5% of issued capital during a three-year period. As Rio Tinto Limited satis/fies awards by market purchase, Rio Tinto Limited is in compliance with this requirement.\n\nAll other share awards are satis/fied by shares that are purchased in the market. Further information in respect of the share plan arrangements and outstanding balances under each plan can be found in note 41 to the /financial statements.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nIn the table below, we set out the results of the remuneration-related resolutions approved at the Group's 2020 AGMs and the Group's 2018 AGMs for the current Policy. Our meetings with shareholders in 2020 were well attended and provided an opportunity for the Committee Chairman to discuss remuneration-related topics with shareholders.\n\n| Resolution                                                            | Total votes cast Votes for   | Votes against   | Votes withheld (a)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Approval of the Directors' Remuneration Report: Implementation Report | 1,137,495,323 1,062,225,236  | 75,270,087      | 26,050,466           |\n|                                                                       | 93.4%                        | 6.6%            |                      |\n| Approval of the Directors' Remuneration Report                        | 1,145,929,618 1,062,051,718  | 83,877,900      | 17,616,089           |\n|                                                                       | 92.7%                        | 7.3%            |                      |\n| Approval of the Remuneration Policy (2018)                            | 1,209,963,085 1,157,103,709  | 52,859,376      | 37,598,712           |\n|                                                                       | 95.6%                        | 4.4%            |                      |",

        "page_content": "## Political donations\n\nRio Tinto prohibits the use of its funds to support political candidates or parties. No political donations were made by the Group for political purposes during the year. In the United States, in accordance with the United States Federal Election Campaign Act, we provide administrative support for the Rio Tinto America Political Action Committee (PAC), which was created in 1990 and encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All Rio Tinto America PAC employee contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state law and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. The PAC is controlled by neither Rio Tinto nor any of its subsidiaries but instead by a governing board of 5 employee members on a voluntary basis. In 2020, contributions to Rio Tinto America PAC by 15 employees amounted to $8,475.45, and Rio Tinto America PAC donated $11,500 in political contributions in 2020.\n\n## Government regulations\n\nOur operations around the world are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed by local, state, provincial and federal governments. These regulations govern many aspects of our work - from how we explore, mine and process ore, to conditions of land tenure and health, safety and environmental requirements. They also govern how we operate as a company in relation to securities, taxation, intellectual property, competition and foreign investment, provisions to protect data privacy, conditions of trade and export and infrastructure access. In addition to these laws, several of our operations are governed by speci/fic agreements made with governments, some of which are enshrined in legislation. The geographic and product diversity of our operations reduces the likelihood of any single law or government regulation having a material effect on the Group's business as a whole.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nRio Tinto is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries where it has operations. Rio Tinto measures its performance against environmental regulation by tracking and rating incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance impacts using /five severity categories (minor, medium, serious, major or catastrophic). Incidents with a consequence rating of major or catastrophic are of a severity that require noti/fication to the relevant product group chief executive and the Rio Tinto chief executive immediately after the incident occurring. In 2020, there were no environmental incidents at managed operations with a major or catastrophic impact.\n\nDuring 2020, four managed operations incurred /fines amounting to US$27,387 (2019: US$18,964). Details of these /fines are reported in the Sustainability section of this report, page 84.\n\nAustralian corporations that exceed speci/fic greenhouse gas emissions or energy use thresholds have obligations under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER). All Rio Tinto entities covered under this Act have submitted their annual NGER reports by the required 31 October 2020 deadline.\n\nFurther information on the Group's environmental performance is included in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report, on pages 62-91, and on the website.\n\n## Energy ef/ficiency action\n\nDetails of the measures taken to increase the company's energy ef/ficiency are reported on pages 67, 79 and 97 of this report.\n\n## Energy consumption (a)(b)(c)\n\n| Energy consumption in GWh                                                         | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| From activities including the combustion of fuel and  the operation of facilities | 86,389  | 86,111  |\n| From the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling                          | 22,778  | 23,056  |\n| Total energy consumed (d)                                                         | 111,667 | 112,778 |\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n## (in million tCO 2 -e) (e)(f)(g)\n\n|                                                              | 2020   | 2019      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Scope 1 (h)                                                  | 17.1   | 17.2 (l)  |\n| Scope 2 (i)                                                  | 9.5    | 9.7       |\n| Total greenhouse gas emissions (j)                           | 26.2   | 26.4      |\n| Ratios                                                       |        |           |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions intensity index (k)                 | 72.6   | 71.0 (l)  |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions intensity   (tCO 2 -e/t of product) | 0.060  | 0.063 (l) |\n\n## Exploration, research and development\n\nThe Group carries out exploration, research and development, described in the Innovation section on pages 58-59. Exploration and evaluation costs, net of any gains and losses on disposal, generated a net loss before tax of $624 million (2019: $614 million). Research and development costs were $45 million (2019: $45 million).\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the Group's /financial risk management objectives and policies, and exposure to risk, are described in note 29 to the /financial statements.\n\n## Dealing in Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto Securities Dealing Policy restricts dealing in Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities by directors and employees who may be in possession of 'inside information'. These individuals must seek clearance before any proposed dealing takes place.\n\nOur policy also prohibits such persons from engaging in hedging or other arrangements which limit the economic risk in connection to Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities issued, or otherwise allocated, as remuneration that are either unvested, or that have vested, but remain subject to a holding period. We also impose restrictions on a broader group of employees, requiring them to seek clearance before engaging in similar arrangements over any Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe directors are required to prepare /financial statements for each /financial period that give a true and fair view of the state of the Group at the end of the /financial period, together with pro/fit or loss and cash /flows for that period. This/uni00A0includes preparing /financial statements in accordance with UK company law and preparing a Remuneration Report that includes the information required by Regulation 11, Schedule 8 of the Large- and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the Australian Corporations Act 2001.\n\nIn addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board provides a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects in its external reporting.",

They consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, in accordance with UK and Australian legislation. They have a general responsibility to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Group's website.\n\nLegislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of /financial statements may differ from current and future legislation in other jurisdictions. The work carried out by the Group's external auditors does not take into account such legislation and, accordingly, the external auditors accept no responsibility for any changes to the /financial statements after they are made available on the Group's website.\n\nThe directors, senior executives, senior /financial managers and other members of staff who are required to exercise judgment while preparing the Group's /financial statements, are required to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty and in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as are all Group employees.\n\nThe directors consider that the 2020 Annual Report presents a true and fair view and has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, using the most appropriate accounting policies for Rio/uni00A0Tinto's business, and supported by reasonable judgments and estimates. The accounting policies have been consistently applied as described on pages 206-222, and directors have received a written statement from the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Of/ficer to this effect. In accordance with the internal control requirements of the Code and the ASX Principles, this written statement con/firms that the declarations in the statement are founded on a sound system of risk management and internal controls, and that the system is operating effectively in all material respects in relation to /financial reporting risks. Further information on directors' responsibilities in the light of UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules is included on page 311.\n\n## Directors' declaration\n\nThe directors' statement of responsibilities in relation to the Group's /financial statements is set out on page 311.\n\n## Non-audit services and auditor independence\n\nDetails of the non-audit services and a statement of independence regarding the provision of non-audit services undertaken by our external auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, are set out on page 134 of the Directors' Report.\n\nA copy of the Auditor's Independence Declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 328.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have satis/fied themselves that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the /financial statements. Additionally, the directors have considered longer-term viability, as described in their statement on page 94.\n\n## 2021 AGMs\n\nThe 2021 AGMs will be held on 9 April in the UK and 6 May in Australia.

As our shares are listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, we set out how we have complied with the codes and standards of those bodies on the following pages:\n\n- -London Stock Exchange - UK Corporate Governance Code (2018 version) (the UK Code), see pages 191-193.\n- -Australian Securities Exchange - ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4 th edition) (the ASX Principles), see pages 193-195.\n\nIn addition, as explained below, as a foreign private issuer (FPI) with American Depository Receipts (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we need to report any signi/ficant corporate governance differences from the NYSE listing standards (NYSE Standards) followed by US companies.\n\n## Statement of compliance with the Code and ASX Principles\n\nThroughout 2020 and as at the date of this report, the Group has applied the Principles of the UK Code and the ASX Principles. The UK Code is available at www.frc.org.uk, and the ASX Principles at www.asx.com/au. For the purposes of ASX Listing Rule 4.10.3 and the ASX Principles, pages 113-139 of this report form our 'Corporate Governance Statement'. This statement is current as at 22 February 2021, unless otherwise indicated, and has been approved by the Board. Corporate governance documents and policies referenced can be found at riotinto.com/invest/corporategovernance.\n\nWe have complied with all relevant provisions of the UK Code throughout/uni00A02020.\n\n## Difference from NYSE listing standards\n\nWe have reviewed the NYSE Standards and consider that our practices are broadly consistent with them, with the following exceptions where the literal requirements of the NYSE Standards are not met due to differences in corporate governance between the US, UK and Australia:\n\n- -The NYSE Standards state that US companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee which, in addition to identifying individuals quali/fied to become board members, develops and recommends to the board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the company. Our Nominations Committee does not develop corporate governance principles for the Board's approval. The Board itself develops such principles.\n- -Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, the company is required to have an audit committee that is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of external auditors. While our Audit Committee makes recommendations to the Board on these matters, and is subject to legal and regulatory requirements on oversight of audit tenders, the ultimate responsibility for the appointment and retention of the external auditors of Rio Tinto rests with the shareholders.\n- -Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, an audit committee is required to establish procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and audit matters. The whistleblowing programme enables employees to raise any concerns con/fidentially or anonymously. The Board has responsibility to ensure that the programme is in place and to review the reports arising from its operations.\n\n## The UK Code\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose A. Making the board effective\n\nOur Board provides effective and entrepreneurial leadership. It is collectively responsible for the stewardship and long-term success of the Group. There is a framework of prudent and effective controls that enable risk to be assessed and managed. The Sustainability section on pages 61-91 sets out how we assess our impact on wider society. See page 121 for the key activities undertaken by the Board during the year and the factors that were considered when making decisions. In 2020, the Board undertook an internally facilitated effectiveness review and details of this are provided on pages 126-127 of the Governance report.\n\n## B. The company's purpose, values and strategy and alignment with/uni00A0culture\n\nThrough our The Way We Work framework, the Board sets the company's purpose, values, and standards for the Group's employees. The Board is committed to acting in accordance with these values, championing, and embedding these in the organisation. The Board also seeks to ensure that the culture of the company is aligned with these values and standards. In this report, we address the events at Juukan Gorge (see pages 10-11and 114-115) and the actions we have taken to strengthen our processes and approach to cultural heritage.\n\n## C. Company performance and risk management\n\nThe Board leads the development of long-term investment plans for the company. It aims to make good quality decisions at the right time, to achieve the company's objectives, in alignment with our purpose, values and strategy. The role of the Board in establishing and monitoring the internal control environment is set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 131-135. The way in which the company manages risk is set out on pages 92-109. For information on the delegation of business to management please refer to pages 118-119.\n\nThe formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board's decision, available on our website, covers areas including: setting the Group's purpose and strategic vision; monitoring performance of the delivery of the approved strategy; approving major investments, acquisitions and divestments; the oversight of risk and the setting of the Group's risk appetite; and reviewing the Group's governance framework.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Chairman undertakes regular engagement with our major shareholders, in addition to that carried out by the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Of/ficer and the investor relations team. The committee chairs also engage with their relevant stakeholders and details of this engagement is provided in each of the committee reports. We have mapped our key stakeholders and continually work to understand their views and we take account of our responsibilities to our stakeholders when making business decisions. We explain more about this in our section 172 (1) statement, set out on pages 122-123. We also discuss stakeholders in the Strategic Report on pages 18-19 and in the Sustainability section.\n\nDuring 2020, the full Board took responsibility for workforce engagement and we explain how we have engaged with employees during the year, what we have heard and what actions we have taken on page 122. From January 2021, the Board has appointed Simon McKeon as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement. The Board considers that this approach will help sharpen the focus on dialogue with the workforce, with Simon leading the overall programme of engagement.\n\nAt Rio Tinto plc's AGM on 8 April 2020, Resolution 24 ('Authority to purchase Rio Tinto plc shares') was passed with less than 80% of votes in favour and Shining Prospect (a subsidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of China ('Chinalco')) voted against. Chinalco has not sold any Rio Tinto plc shares and now has a holding of over 14% given its non-participation in Rio Tinto's signi/ficant share buy-back programmes over the last four years. This places Chinalco close to the 14.99% threshold agreed with the Australian Government at the time of Chinalco's original investment in 2008. An update was given in the Interim /financial statement provided on 29 July 2020, which was within the six month period.",

        "page_content": "## Compliance with Governance Codes and Standards continued\n\n## E. Our workforce policies and practices\n\nGroup workforce policies are approved by the Board. All the policies relating to our workforce take account of the global nature of our company. Our whistleblowing process is overseen by the Board and every member of the workforce has access to the whistleblower programme and details of this programme are on page 87.\n\n## Division of responsibilities F. The role of the Chairman\n\nThe Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness. He was independent on the date of his appointment and we consider he remains independent for the purposes of the Code. He recognises the importance of creating a boardroom culture which encourages openness and debate and ensures constructive relations between executive and non-executive directors.\n\nThe Chairman is responsible for: the management of the Board and its committees; director performance; induction; training and development; succession planning; engagement with external stakeholders; and attendance by the Board at shareholder meetings. The Chairman is supported by the senior independent directors, the Group company secretary and the Chief Executive. In line with the UK Code, the senior independent director, Rio Tinto plc, is responsible for acting as a sounding board for the Chairman and engages with shareholders to develop a balanced understanding of their interests and concerns. For further details, please see our Board Charter which sets out the role, responsibilities, structure, compositions and conduct of the Board, as well as the role of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director Rio Tinto plc,the Senior Independent Director Rio Tinto Ltd and the Chief Executive - riotinto.com/en/invest/corporate-governance/ board-governance.\n\n## G. Composition of the board\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Board comprises ten members: eight independent NEDs, the Chairman, and the Chief Executive.\n\nAs detailed in the Nominations Committee report, we have engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for a new non-executive director following David Constable's departure. A process is also underway for the appointment of a permanent Chief Financial Of/ficer.\n\nThe Board is satis/fied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge of the company to enable its members to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively, and that no individual or group can dominate the Board's decision-making.\n\nThere is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of our business. The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and, under a Group delegation of authority framework, delegates to other members of the Executive Committee.\n\n## H. Role of non-executive directors\n\nWe list all of the non-executive directors that we consider to be independent on pages 116-117 of this report. Over 50% of the Board (excluding the Chairman) are non-executive directors. The non-executive directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. They are also responsible for scrutinising management performance and ensuring that /financial information, risks and controls, and systems of risk management are robust. In order to enhance Board engagement in Australia, the role of Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto Limited, was established this year. Simon McKeon was appointed to this position and the terms of this appointment were agreed by the Board.\n\nThe Board held an internally facilitated Board evaluation this year and as part of this process, the Board met without the Chairman present and a full assessment of the Chairman's capability was carried out. Details of this review are on pages 126-127. Each director has undertaken to allocate suf/ficient time to the Group in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively, and this is kept under review by the Nominations Committee. The directors' other appointments are listed on pages 116-117.\n\n## I. Board processes and role of the Company Secretary\n\nThe Governance Framework on page 120 explains the governance structure of the Board and sets out the relationship with the Chief Executive. The roles and responsibilities of each committee are explained. The Board insights section provides some examples of the decision making process of the Board and the steps it takes to function effectively, including how it considers stakeholders in this process.\n\nThe Group company secretary is the trusted interlocutor within the Board and its committees, and between senior leadership and the non-executive directors. He is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. He supports the Chairman in ensuring that the information provided to the Board is of suf/ficient quality and appropriate detail in order for the Board to function effectively and/uni00A0ef/ficiently.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation J. Appointments to the board\n\nThe Nominations Committee ensures a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors. It is also responsible for Board succession planning, regularly assessing the balance of skills, experience, diversity and capacity required to oversee the delivery of Rio Tinto's strategy. It reviews proposals for appointments to the Executive Committee, and monitors executive succession planning. This year the Nominations Committee oversaw the succession of the Chief Executive and details of this process are provided in the Nominations Committee report on pages 128-130.\n\nAll non-executive directors are members of the Nominations Committee. The committee is chaired by the Chairman, apart from when the committee is dealing with the appointment of his or her successor. Only the Chairman and committee members have the right to attend the meetings of the Nominations Committee; attendance by all other individuals is by invitation only. The Nominations Committee report sets out the Board's approach to succession planning and how this supports the development of a diverse pipeline, at all levels. All directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGM.\n\nDetails of external search consultancies used for Board appointments can be found in the Nominations Committee report.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the board and its committees\n\nIn our succession planning, we aim to bring a diverse and complementary range of skills, knowledge and experience to the Board, so that we are equipped to navigate the operational, social, regulatory and geopolitical complexity in which our business operates. Achieving the right blend of skills and diversity to support effective decision-making is a continuing process. Further details on tenure and experience of the Board are set out in the Nominations Committee report on pages 128-130. The Board biographies set out the speci/fic skills and experience which each director brings to the Board (page 116-117).\n\n## L.

Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe Remuneration Committee supports the Board by setting our Remuneration Policy. Through long-term and short-term incentives, our Remuneration Policy is designed to help drive a performance culture which incentivises executives to deliver the Group's long-term strategy and create superior shareholder value over the short, medium and long term. The overarching aim is to ensure our remuneration structure and policies reward fairly and responsibly with a clear link to corporate and individual performance, and to the company's long-term strategy and values. We have worked to ensure that we have a clear policy that can be understood by shareholders and stakeholders. Our proposed new policy is included on pages 151-158.\n\n## Q. Procedure for developing Remuneration Policy\n\nWe have a formal and transparent procedure for developing our Remuneration Policy, and no director is involved in deciding their own remuneration. Executive remuneration is set with regard to the wider workforce and through market benchmarking. For further detail, please refer to the Remuneration Committee report on pages 140-185. The Remuneration Committee is supported by remuneration consultant Deloitte. The Board received assurance from the Remuneration Committee and from Deloitte that Deloitte did not have any connections with Rio Tinto or the Board that would have impaired its independence. Please refer to page 159 of this Annual Report for further detail.\n\n## R. Exercising independent judgement\n\nThe Remuneration Committee comprises four non-executive directors to ensure independent judgment with regard to remuneration outcomes. The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration on an annual basis and determines outcomes by assessing executive performance against performance criteria, details of which can be found in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 140-185 of this Annual Report. This states how our Remuneration Policy has been applied and sets out details of any adjustments made or discretions exercised.\n\n## ASX Principles\n\n## Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight Recommendation 1.1\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have a common Board of Directors.

        "page_content": "## Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards\n\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as defined in note 1, which differs in certain respects from the version of International Financial Reporting Standards that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS).\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, the Group's financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. Under IFRS, as defined in note 1, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Group's UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity. As a consequence, shareholders' funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$374 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: US$379 million).\n\nSave for the exception described above, the Group's financial statements drawn up in accordance with IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.\n\n## Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements The Rio Tinto Group\n\nThese are the financial statements of the Group formed through the merger of economic interests of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited ('Merger'), and presented by both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited as their consolidated financial statements in accordance with both UK and Australian legislation and regulations .\n\n## Merger terms\n\nOn 21 December 1995, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited entered into a dual listed companies (DLC) merger. Rio Tinto plc is incorporated in the UK and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges and Rio Tinto Limited is incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The Merger was effected by contractual arrangements between the companies and amendments to Rio Tinto plc's Memorandum and Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution.\n\nAs a result, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective groups operate together as a single economic enterprise, with neither assuming a dominant role. In particular, the arrangements:\n\n- - confer upon the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited a common economic interest in both groups;\n- - provide for common boards of directors and a unified management structure;\n- - provide for equalised dividends and capital distributions; and\n- - provide for the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to take key decisions, including the election of directors, through an electoral procedure in which the public shareholders of the two companies in effect vote on a joint basis.\n\nThe Merger involved no change in the legal ownership of any assets of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor any change in the ownership of any existing shares or securities of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor the issue of any shares, securities or payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each company of one special voting share to a trustee company which facilitates the joint electoral procedure for public shareholders. During 2002, each of the parent companies issued a DLC Dividend Share to facilitate the efficient management of funds within the DLC structure.\n\n## Accounting standards\n\nThe financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with IFRS as defined in note 1. The Merger was accounted for as a merger under UK GAAP. As permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS, which are set out in IFRS 1, the Group did not restate business combinations that occurred before the transition date of 1 January 2004. As a result, the DLC Merger of economic interests described above continues to be accounted for as a merger under IFRS as defined in note 1.\n\nThe main consequence of adopting merger rather than acquisition accounting is that the balance sheet of the merged Group includes the assets and liabilities of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited at their carrying values prior to the Merger, subject to adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, rather than at their fair values at the date of the Merger. For accounting purposes Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single public parent company (with their respective public shareholders being the shareholders in that single company). As a result, the amounts attributable to both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders are included in the amounts attributed to owners of Rio Tinto on the balance sheet, income statement and statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Australian Corporations Act\n\nThe financial statements are drawn up in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 24 July 2020. The main effect of the order is that the financial statements are prepared on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity, and in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS) and include a reconciliation from EU IFRS to the Australian equivalent of IFRS (see above).\n\nFor further details of the ASIC Class Order relief see page 310.\n\n205",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies\n\n## Corporate information\n\nRio Tinto's business is finding, mining and processing mineral resources. Major products are aluminium, copper, diamonds, gold, industrial minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt), iron ore and uranium. Activities span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North America, with significant businesses also in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nRio Tinto plc is incorporated in the UK and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges and Rio Tinto Limited is incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Rio Tinto plc's registered office is at 6 St James's Square, London SW1Y 4AD, UK. Rio Tinto Limited's registered office is at Level 7, 360 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia.\n\nAs described in the 'Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements' on page 205, for the purposes of preparing the IFRS compliant consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group, both the DLC companies, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, are viewed as a single economic entity, and the interests of shareholders of both companies are presented as the equity interests of shareholders in the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nThese financial statements consolidate the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (together 'the Companies') and their respective subsidiaries (together 'the Group') and include the Group's share of joint arrangements and associates as explained in note 1(b) below. The Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 were authorised for issue in accordance with a directors' resolution on 22 February 2021.\n\nNotes 32 to 35 provide more information on the Group's subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates and note 39 provides information on the Group's transactions with other related parties.\n\nThe 2020 Annual Report satisfies the obligations of Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian company law, as amended by an order issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 24 July 2020. The 2020 financial statements disclose on page 205 the effect of the adjustments to the Group's consolidated profit/ (loss), consolidated total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders' funds as prepared under IFRS as defined below that would be required under the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS).\n\nThe US dollar is the presentation currency used in these financial statements, as it most reliably reflects the Group's global business performance.\n\n## Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe basis of preparation and the accounting policies used in preparing the Group's 2020 financial statements are set out below.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and in accordance with applicable UK law, applicable Australian law as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 24 July 2020, Article 4 of the European Union IAS regulation and also with:\n\n- -International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) both as adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), and which are mandatory for EU reporting as at 31 December 2020; (EU IFRS) and\n- - International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS IC which are mandatory as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively referred to as 'IFRS' in this report. The Group has not early adopted any amendments, standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet mandatory.\n\nThe UK's transition period for leaving the EU ended on 31 December 2020. In accordance with consequent changes to applicable UK law, the Group will include the following in the basis of preparation for its 2021 financial statements:\n\n- - International Financial Reporting standards as issued by the IASB and interpretations issued from time to time as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK).\n\n## COVID-19 impact\n\nDespite various COVID-19 related challenges, the Group's assets have continued to operate, with our first priority being the protection of the health and safety of all our employees and communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has implemented strict protocols globally across the business. These range from physical distancing, travel restrictions, roster changes and team splits, to flexible working arrangements, rapid screening and personal hygiene controls. The Group has delivered a good operational performance across most of our assets, catching up on planned maintenance activity in the second half of the year, particularly in iron ore, and continuing to adapt to new operating conditions as we learn to live with COVID-19.  Recognising the broad and complex impacts of the pandemic on our markets, operations and financial performance, we have chosen not to segregate COVID-19 related costs from our underlying performance metrics.\n\n## Going concern\n\nManagement has prepared cash flow forecast scenarios that represent plausible downside scenarios to the business and global economy including the effects arising from the COVID-19 pandemic for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, which have been reviewed by the directors. These forecasts demonstrate that the Group has sufficient cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it  to meet its obligations as they fall due. As such the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the full year financial information. Further detail on the going concern basis of accounting is included on page 190.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change, the transition to a low-carbon future and our ambition to achieve net zero emissions across our operations by 2050.\n\nWe framed the strategic context for the Group and our internal price setting process, including carbon price assumptions, through the lens of three plausible scenarios structured around the interplay of three global forces: Realpolitik, Society and Technology.\n\n- - In Realpolitik, a fragmented world order, defined by strong nationalistic tendencies including structural tensions between the United States and China, holds back trade and global action on climate. Despite a low growth environment, global warming is on a path to reach or even exceed 3\u00b0C by 2100. Carbon prices remain low - in the range US$0-30/ tCO2e.\n- - In Society, strong global co-ordination of climate policies, supported by high and rising carbon prices (reaching US$130/tCO2e in developed countries by 2040), accelerates the energy transition. Despite stronger economic growth in low-income countries, global emissions peak and start to decline early, turning net-negative during the second half of the century, to meet the Paris goal of keeping temperature increases below 2\u00b0C.",

        "page_content": "- - In Technology, the fast roll-out of innovation provides both a strong boost to global economic productivity and decarbonisation efforts. But, without adequate policy support and with carbon prices remaining modest (US$15 to US$30/tCO2e by 2030) the decline in global emissions is insufficient to keep temperature increases below 2\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nThrough our strategy process we test the resilience of our portfolio against each of these three scenarios. Overall, our portfolio is expected to perform more strongly in scenarios with proactive climate action, however we have not yet assessed the complete financial reporting consequences of a single Paris aligned scenario (more details on our portfolio scenario analysis can be found in our 2020 Climate Change report).\n\nThe scenarios also inform the internal price setting process led by our Economics team.  Those  prices (including carbon) are used pervasively in our financial processes from budgeting, forecasting, capital allocation and project evaluation to the determination of Ore Reserves. In turn these prices are used to derive critical accounting estimates including as inputs to impairment testing (note 6), estimation of remaining economic life for units of production depreciation (note 1(i)) and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions (note 25).\n\nAs only one of the scenarios is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our internal carbon prices are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet those goals.\n\n## New standards issued\n\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for the accounting requirements set out below, all of which were effective as at 1 January 2020 without restatement of prior years.\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and critical accounting judgments have been updated to include the Group's approach to materiality upon implementation of \"Definition of Material, Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8\" (refer to \"Materiality\" below). The amendments do not affect the Group's approach to identifying and evaluating material transactions, or result in any change to  policies and procedures for reviewing whether a disclosure or presentation is material.\n\nThe IASB revised its Conceptual Framework which is mandatory in 2020. It is not a standard and does not override any standard, but its principles apply to arrangements not covered by IFRS standards. No arrangements have been identified which require a change in accounting treatment under the revised Conceptual Framework.\n\nThe Group has adopted the definition of a business as required by \"Definition of a business - amendments to IFRS 3\" (refer to note 1b), Basis of consolidation, Acquisitions). Changes might result in future investment in new operations being accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than as business combinations, however no evaluation of a transaction under the amended IFRS 3 has been required in 2020.\n\n## Standards issued, but not yet effective\n\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16, endorsed by the UK and mandatory in 2021)\n\nThe amendments address the financial reporting impact from reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates (collectively 'IBOR reform'). Financial authorities have asked market participants to complete the transition to alternative Risk Free Rates (RFR) by the end of 2021. As part of the Group's transition plan, a multidisciplinary working group continues to assess the impact of IBOR reform on systems, processes and financial reporting.\n\nThe Group will take relevant Phase 2 practical reliefs from certain requirements in IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and hedge accounting.\n\nBased on the Group's assessment we expect that the most significant practical impact from IBOR reform will be on our hedging arrangements and that this will arise from reform of US LIBOR. At 31 December 2020, the Group has interest rate risk exposure including  US$7.3 billion nominal values of fixed-rate borrowings swapped to US dollar rates in fair value hedge relationships, described further in note 29 A (b) (v). It is anticipated that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) benchmark rate, recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, will be widely adopted by market participants and in practice will replace US LIBOR by the end of 2021. We expect application of the Phase 2 reliefs to result in continuation of the Group's pre-existing hedge accounting upon amendment of designated arrangements in response to the replacement of IBOR with new benchmarks. The Group early adopted, in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, 'Phase 1 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, and IFRS 7- Interest rate benchmark reform', which allowed temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by IBOR reform (refer to note 1 q (iv)). This temporary relief is expected to cease, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, when the designated hedge relationship is amended and application of Phase 2 reliefs begins.\n\nIn addition, the Group has a number of arrangements which reference IBOR benchmarks and extend beyond 2021. These include third-party borrowings relating to the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance facility and other secured loans (refer to note 21), a number of intragroup balances and certain commercial contracts. Other arrangements which currently reference IBOR benchmarks include accessible revolving lines of credit (refer to note 29 A (b)), and shareholder loan facilities. Phase 2 amendments will require the Group to account for a change in the basis for determining the cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability measured at amortised cost, by updating their respective effective interest rates as required by IBOR reform. As a result of the relief the Group expects that no significant gain or loss will arise from these updates.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16, mandatory in 2022 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nUnder the amendments the proceeds from selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the costs of producing those items. The impact from adoption is not currently expected to be material for the Group.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37, mandatory in 2022 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The Group is currently evaluating the impacts of this amendment.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance\n\nContracts (mandatory in 2023 and not yet endorsed by the UK) The standard provides consistent principles for all aspects of accounting for insurance contracts. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of financial statements\" on classification of liabilities (mandatory in 2023 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nNarrow-scope amendments to IAS 1 clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period.  Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date. The Group is currently evaluating the impacts of this amendment.\n\n207",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\n## Other standards\n\nThe following new and amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements: COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16, effective in 2021), Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3, effective in 2022) and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards, (effective 2023).\n\n## Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to use judgment in applying accounting policies and in making critical accounting estimates.\n\nThese judgments and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements. Areas of judgment in the application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are noted below and further information is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThese areas of judgment and estimation are discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates on pages 219-222. The quantum of ore reserves and mineral resources impacts many of these areas and the basis of calculation is explained below. Information on less material judgments and sources of estimation uncertainty has been incorporated into the relevant accounting policy notes.\n\nAreas of judgment in the application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements in the current year are:\n\n- - Impairment of non-current assets - determination of cash-generating units (CGUs) and assessment of indicators of impairment  - note 1(e) and (i), critical policy (i), note 6, note 12 and note 13.\n- - Estimation of asset lives - determination of the life of the orebody and mine reserves, including grade cut-off assumptions consistent with the internal prices described in the Climate Change section - note 1(i) and critical policy (ii).\n- - Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations - determining when a closure study plan and cost estimate is sufficiently advanced and reliable to form the basis for an update - note 1(l) and critical policy (iii).\n- - Deferral of stripping costs - judgment on components/strip ratios and separate or integrated multiple pit mines - note 1(h) and critical policy (iv).\n- - Uncertain tax positions - technical interpretation of tax law and evaluation of outcomes in the determination of whether multiple or binary scenarios are the appropriate basis for provision measurement note 1(n), critical policy (v), note 9 and note 30.\n- - Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets - recognition of deferred tax assets for loss making operations - critical policy (vi) and note 17.\n\nOther areas of judgment impacting the financial statements are:\n\n- - Provision for onerous contracts - determination of assets dedicated to a contract - note 1(i) and critical policy (vii).\n- - Identification of functional currencies - different companies may make different judgments based on similar facts - note 1(d) and critical policy (viii).\n- - Basis of consolidation - judgment as to when the Group has control, joint control or significant influence - critical policy (ix) and notes 32-35.\n- - Contingencies - assessing the probability of any loss and whether it is possible to quantify any loss - critical policy (x) and note 30.\n\n208\n\n- - Exclusions from underlying earnings - judgment on items to be excluded on grounds of nature or size - critical policy (xi) and note 2.\n- - Accounting for the Pilbara Iron Arrangements - treatment of payments made over a contractually specified period for network infrastructure capacity - critical policy (xiii) and note 33(c).\n\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:\n\n- - Impairment of non-current assets - review of asset carrying values, impairment charges and reversals and the recoverability of goodwill determination of discounted cash flows - note1(e) and (i), critical estimates (i), note 6, note 12 and note 13.\n- - Close-down, restoration and environmental cost obligations estimation of costs and the timing of expenditure - note 1(l), critical estimates (iii) and note 25.\n- - Uncertain tax positions - estimating the potential exposures for each possible scenario - note 1(n), critical estimates (v), note 9 and note 30.\n- - Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets - determination of cash flows - note 1(n), critical estimates (vi) and note 17.\n- - Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs - note 1(o), critical estimates (xiv) and note 42.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe Group considers information to be material if correcting a misstatement, omission or obscuring could, in the light of surrounding circumstances, reasonably be expected to change the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the financial statements. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether information is material; the concept of materiality is therefore not driven purely by numerical values.\n\nWhen considering the potential materiality of information, management makes an initial quantitative assessment using thresholds based on estimates of profit before taxation; for the year ended 31 December 2020 the quantitative threshold was US$550 million (year ended 31 December 2019: US$350 million based on underlying earnings). However, other considerations can result in a determination that lower values are material or, occasionally, that higher values are immaterial. These considerations include whether a misstatement, omission or obscuring: masks a change or trend in key performance indicators; causes reported key metrics to change from a positive to negative values or vice-versa; affects compliance with regulatory requirements or other contractual requirements; could result in an increase to management's compensation; or might conceal an unlawful transaction.\n\nIn assessing materiality, management also applies judgment based on its understanding of the business and its internal and external financial statement users. The assessment will consider user expectations of numerical and narrative reporting. Sources used in making this assessment would include, for example: published analyst consensus measures, experience gained in formal and informal dialogue with users (including regulatory correspondence), and peer group benchmarking.\n\n## Ore reserves and mineral resources\n\nEstimates of ore reserves and, in some cases, mineral resources can impact: depreciation and amortisation rates; the carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; deferred stripping costs; provisions for close-down and restoration costs; and the recovery of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code (see note 1(j)).",

        "page_content": "The estimation of ore reserves and mineral resources requires judgment to interpret available geological data and subsequently to select an appropriate mining method and then to establish an extraction schedule. Estimation requires assumptions about future commodity prices and demand, exchange rates, production costs, transport costs, close-down and restoration costs, recovery rates and discount rates and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences.\n\nThere are many uncertainties in the estimation process and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. New geological or economic data, or unforeseen operational issues, may change estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources.\n\nThe Group uses judgment as to when to include mineral resources in accounting estimates, for example, the use of mineral resources in the Group's depreciation policy is described in note 1(i) below and in the determination of the date of closure as described in note 1(l). The unaudited statement of ore reserves is included on page 325 and of mineral resources on page 329.\n\n## (a) Accounting convention\n\nThe financial information included in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, and for the related comparative periods, has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain derivative contracts and financial assets, the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the hedged item and the accounting for post-employment assets and obligations. The Group's policy in respect of these items is set out in the notes below.\n\nAll financial statement values are rounded to the nearest million (US$m) unless otherwise stated.\n\nWhere applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to measure or present them on the same basis as current period figures.\n\n## (b) Basis of consolidation (notes 32-35)\n\nAll intragroup transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the locally reported assets, liabilities, and results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by either of the companies. Control exists where either of the companies has: power over the entities, that is, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entities (those that significantly affect the companies' returns); exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities; and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement (those that significantly affect the companies' returns) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Group has two types of joint arrangements:\n\n## Joint operations (JO)\n\nA JO is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. In relation to its interest in a JO, the Group recognises: its share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the JO. These amounts are recorded in the Group's financial statements on the appropriate lines.\n\n## Joint ventures (JV)\n\nA JV is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted for using the equity accounting method.\n\n## Other unincorporated arrangements\n\nIn some cases, the Group participates in unincorporated arrangements and has rights to its share of the assets and obligations for its share of the liabilities of the arrangement rather than a right to a net return, but does not share joint control. In such cases, the Group recognises: its share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the unincorporated arrangement; and its share of expenses. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the arrangement. These amounts are recorded in the Group's financial statements on the appropriate lines.\n\n## Associates\n\nAn associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to exist where there is neither control nor joint control and the Group has over 20% of the voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Significant influence can arise where the Group holds less than 20% of the voting rights if it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity accounting method.\n\nThe Group uses the term 'equity accounted units' (EAUs) to refer to associates and JVs collectively. Under the equity accounting method the investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group's share of the EAUs' retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Long-term loans to EAUs that in substance form part of the Group's net investment (quasi equity loans) are financial assets but are included in the line 'Investments in equity accounted units' on the face of the balance sheet. When the Group's share of losses in an EAU equals or exceeds its interest in the EAU, including such long-term loans and any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations to continue to make payments on behalf of the EAU.\n\n## Acquisitions (note 36)\n\nUnder the 'acquisition' method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed (the identifiable net assets) on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is obtained.\n\nIn determining whether a particular set of activities is a business, an acquired arrangement has to have an input and substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\n\n209",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and any equity interests issued by the Group. Costs related to the acquisition of a subsidiary are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any shortfall is immediately recognised in the income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the acquiree, that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation, are recognised by the Group in one of two ways with the choice being available on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. They can be measured at either the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets or at fair value. In some cases, non-controlling interests may be treated as equity options and valued on that basis. Goodwill (see note 1(e)) and amounts attributable to non-controlling interests will differ depending on the basis used.\n\nWhere the Group previously held a non-controlling interest in the acquiree, this is remeasured to fair value at the date control is obtained with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement. The cash cost of the share purchase that gives rise to control is included within 'investing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nWhere the Group increases its ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net assets acquired is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases is included within 'financing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nProvisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.\n\nThe results of businesses acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control, joint control or significant influence is obtained.\n\n## Disposals (note 36)\n\nIndividual non-current assets or 'disposal groups' (that is, groups of assets and liabilities) to be disposed of by sale or otherwise in a single transaction are classified as 'held for sale' if the following criteria are met at the period end:\n\n- - The carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use; and\n- - The disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for such sales; and\n- - The sale is highly probable.\n\nDisposal groups held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The comparative balance sheet is not restated. Disposal groups acquired with a view to resale are held at the fair value determined at the acquisition date. For these assets acquired for resale no profits or losses are recognised between the acquisition date and the disposal date, unless there is a subsequent impairment.\n\nOn classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated and, if applicable, equity accounting ceases.\n\n210\n\nIf control is lost, any interest in the entity retained by the Group is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement. The retained interest may be subsequently accounted for as a joint venture, joint operation, associate or financial asset depending on the facts. Certain amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the entity disposed of, or for which control, joint control or significant influence has ceased, may be recycled to the income statement. The cash proceeds of disposals are included within 'Investing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nChanges in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for in equity. The cash proceeds of such disposals are included within 'Financing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\n## (c) Sales revenue\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group recognises sales revenue related to the transfer of promised goods or services when control of the goods or services passes to the customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group is or expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales revenue is recognised on individual sales when control transfers to the customer. In most instances, control passes and sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the vessel or vehicle on which it will be transported once loaded, the destination port or the customer's premises. There may be circumstances when judgment is required based on the five indicators of control below.\n\n- - The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\n- - The customer has a present obligation to pay in accordance with the terms of the sales contract. For shipments under the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)/Carriage Paid to (CPT)/Cost and Freight (CFR) this is generally when the ship is loaded, at which time the obligation for payment is for both product and freight.\n- - The customer has accepted the asset. Sales revenue may be subject to adjustment if the product specification does not conform to the terms specified in the sales contract but this does not impact the passing of control. Assay and specification adjustments have been immaterial historically.\n- - The customer has legal title to the asset. The Group usually retains legal title until payment is received for credit risk purposes only.\n- - The customer has physical possession of the asset. This indicator may be less important as the customer may obtain control of an asset prior to obtaining physical possession, which may be the case for goods in transit.\n\nThe Group sells a significant proportion of its products on CFR or CIF Incoterms. This means that the Group is responsible (acts as principal) for providing shipping services and, in some instances, insurance after the date at which control of goods passes to the customer at the loading port.\n\nThe Group therefore has separate performance obligations for freight and insurance services that are provided solely to facilitate sale of the commodities it produces. Other Incoterms commonly used by the Group are Free on Board (FOB), where the Group has no responsibility for freight or insurance once control of the goods has passed at the loading port, and Delivered at Place (DAP), where control of the goods passes when the product is delivered to the agreed destination. For these Incoterms there is only one performance obligation, being for provision of product at the point where control passes.",

        "page_content": "The Group's products are sold to customers under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold in the spot market. Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms, with a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes being sold on the spot market.\n\nWithin each sales contract, each unit of product shipped is a separate performance obligation. Revenue is generally recognised at the contracted price as this reflects the stand-alone selling price. Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Mining royalties payable are presented as an operating cost or, where they are in substance a profit-based tax, within taxation.\n\nSales of copper concentrate are stated net of the treatment and refining charges which will be required to convert it to an end product.\n\nCertain of the Group's products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised; however, substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices in the results for the period. The final selling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract. Final prices for copper concentrate are normally determined between 30-120 days after delivery to the customer. The change in value of the provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant forward market prices and is included in sales revenue.\n\nRio Tinto has a number of long-term contracts to supply product to customers in future periods. Generally, revenues are recognised on an as invoiced basis; hence, the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the entity's performance completed to date.\n\nA number of the Group's businesses provide volume discounts in certain circumstances. The impact of constraining such variable consideration under IFRS 15 was immaterial at both 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information on the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied.\n\n## Presentation and disclosures\n\nConsolidated sales revenue as reported in the income statement comprises sales to third parties. Certain of the Group's products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised. Sales revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers, which is accounted for under IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and subsequent movements in provisionally priced receivables which are accounted for under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. A breakdown of sales revenue between these two amounts is disclosed in the product analysis in note 3 and further detail on provisional pricing in note 3. Sales revenue includes revenue from movements in provisionally priced receivables, consistent with the treatment in prior periods.\n\nThe Group considers that the impact of economic factors on its sales revenue, particularly pricing and volumes, is best understood by reference to the disclosure of sales revenue by product group and sales destination in note 3. The analysis of provisional pricing adjustments by commodity in the product analysis in note 3 shows which products are subject to price volatility post the transfer of control. With the exception of Oyu Tolgoi, which sells copper concentrate to China, this price uncertainty is largely resolved at the period end.\n\nTypically, the Group has a right to payment before or at the point that control of the goods passes including a right, where applicable, to payment for provisionally priced products and unperformed freight and insurance services. Cash received before control passes is recognised as a contract liability. The amount of consideration does not contain a significant financing component as payment terms are less than one year.\n\nRevenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are included in sales revenue. Sundry revenue (eg sales of surplus power) incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the operations is treated as a credit to operating costs.\n\nThe Group does not disclose sales revenue from freight and insurance services separately as it does not consider that this is necessary in order to understand the impact of economic factors on the Group; the Group's Chief Executive, the chief operating decision maker, as defined under IFRS 8, 'Operating Segments', does not review information specifically relating to these sources of revenue in order to evaluate the performance of business segments and Group information on these sources of revenue is not provided externally.\n\nThe Group does provide information on freight revenue for the iron ore and bauxite businesses on pages 45 and 49 to help stakeholders understand FOB operating margins for those products.\n\nThird-party commodity swap arrangements principally for delivery and receipt of smelter-grade alumina are offset within operating costs.\n\n## (d) Currency translation\n\nThe functional currency for each entity in the Group, and for joint arrangements and associates, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For many of these entities, this is the currency of the country in which they are located. Transactions denominated in other currencies are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at periodend exchange rates.\n\nThe Group's financial statements are presented in US dollars, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group as a whole. On consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at average rates of exchange, except for material one-off transactions, which are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates.\n\nExchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income, with the exception of translation adjustments relating to Rio Tinto Limited's share capital which are shown in the statement of changes in equity.\n\nWhere an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group's net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are taken to the currency translation reserve.\n\nExcept as noted above, or in note 1(q) relating to derivative contracts, all other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.\n\n## (e) Goodwill and intangible assets (excluding exploration and evaluation expenditure) (notes 12 and 13)\n\nGoodwill is not amortised; it is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Investments in EAUs, including any goodwill, are tested for impairment as a single asset when a trigger for impairment has been identified. The Group's impairment policy is explained in note 1(i).\n\n211",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nPurchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in accordance with accounting policy note 1(i).\n\nThe Group considers that intangible assets have indefinite lives when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. The factors considered in making this judgment include the existence of contractual rights for unlimited terms or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental cost can be expected for indefinite future periods in view of the Group's investment intentions. The life cycles of the products and processes that depend on the asset are also considered.\n\n## (f) Exploration and evaluation (note 13)\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure comprises costs that are directly attributable to:\n\n- - Researching and analysing existing exploration data;\n- - Conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling;\n- - Examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or\n- - Compiling various studies (order of magnitude, pre-feasibility and feasibility).\n\nExploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity undertaken by the Group is not capitalised.\n\nEvaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been identified as having economic potential. Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable, that is the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks, and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group's view is that a high degree of confidence is greater than 'more likely than not' (that is, greater than 50% certainty) and less than 'virtually certain' (that is, less than 90% certainty).\n\nAssessing whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that an evaluation project is commercially viable requires judgment and consideration of all relevant factors such as the nature and objective of the project; the project's current stage; project timeline; current estimates of the project's net present value, including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions; and the main risks of the project. Development expenditure incurred prior to the decision to proceed is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation, being a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that a project is commercially viable.\n\nIn some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case, it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or when existing smelters or refineries are closed.\n\nOre reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period between declaration of ore reserves and approval to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project's returns.\n\n212\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 6 'Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources', the criteria for the capitalisation of evaluation costs are applied consistently from period to period.\n\nIn the case of undeveloped mining projects which have arisen through acquisition, the allocation of the purchase price consideration may result in undeveloped properties being recognised at an earlier stage of project evaluation compared with projects arising from the Group's exploration and evaluation programme. Subsequent expenditure on acquired undeveloped projects is only capitalised if it meets the high degree of confidence threshold discussed above.\n\nThe carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure for undeveloped mining projects (projects for which the decision to mine has not yet been approved at the appropriate authorisation level within the Group) are reviewed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment in accordance with IFRS 6, and when indicators are identified are tested in accordance with IAS 36. Evaluation expenditure for non-mining projects is reviewed and tested under IAS 36.\n\nThe impairment review is based on a status report summarising the Group's intentions to recover value through development, sale or other partnering arrangements. If a project does not prove viable and is cancelled, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project net of any previously recorded impairment provisions are charged to the income statement.\n\n## (g) Property, plant and equipment (note 14)\n\nOnce an undeveloped mining project has been determined as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant, equipment and capital work in progress is capitalised under 'Mining properties and leases' together with any amount transferred from 'Exploration and evaluation'.\n\nCosts which are necessarily incurred whilst commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable or at the Group or subsidiary's cost of borrowing if not, until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. It may be appropriate to use a subsidiary's cost of borrowing when the debt was negotiated based on the financing requirements of that subsidiary.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes, where applicable, the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes right of use assets (note 14) arising from leasing arrangements, shown separately from owned and leasehold assets.\n\n## (h) Deferred stripping (note 14)\n\nIn open pit mining operations, overburden and other waste materials must be removed to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically. The process of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or, in some instances, pit; see below), before production commences, stripping costs related to a component of an orebody are capitalised as part of the cost of construction of the mine (or pit) and are subsequently amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production basis.",

        "page_content": "Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping (ie overburden and other waste removal) of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping (see below).\n\nThe Group's judgment as to whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's specific circumstances.\n\nThe following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- - If mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively following that of the first pit, rather than concurrently;\n- - If separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset;\n- - If the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit;\n- - If expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large; and\n- - If the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.\n\nIf the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from several pits combined, including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated operation for the purposes of accounting for initial stripping costs. The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case.\n\nIn order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, three criteria must be met:\n\n- - It must be probable that there will be an economic benefit in a future accounting period because the stripping activity has improved access to the orebody;\n- - It must be possible to identify the 'component' of the orebody for which access has been improved; and\n- - It must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity.\n\nA 'component' is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of the larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback).\n\nProduction phase stripping can give rise to two benefits: the extraction of ore in the current period and improved access to ore which will be extracted in future periods. When the cost of stripping which has a future benefit is not distinguishable from the cost of producing current inventories, the stripping cost is allocated to each of these activities based on a relevant production measure using a life-of-component strip ratio. The ratio divides the tonnage of waste mined for the component for the period either by the quantity of ore mined for the component or by the quantity of minerals contained in the ore mined for the component. In some operations, the quantity of ore is a more appropriate basis for allocating costs, particularly where there are significant by-products. Stripping costs for the component are deferred to the extent that the current period ratio exceeds the life of component ratio. The stripping activity asset is depreciated on a 'units of production' basis based on expected production of either ore or minerals contained in the ore over the life of the component unless another method is more appropriate.\n\nThe life-of-component ratios are based on the ore reserves of the mine (and for some mines, other mineral resources) and the annual mine plan; they are a function of the mine design and, therefore, changes to that design will generally result in changes to the ratios. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact the ore reserves (and for some mines, other mineral resources) may also have an impact on the lifeof-component ratios even if they do not affect the mine design. Changes to the ratios are accounted for prospectively.\n\nIt may be the case that subsequent phases of stripping will access additional ore and that these subsequent phases are only possible after the first phase has taken place. Where applicable, the Group considers this on a mine-by-mine basis. Generally, the only ore attributed to the stripping activity asset for the purposes of calculating a life-of-component ratio, and for the purposes of amortisation, is the ore to be extracted from the originally identified component.\n\nDeferred stripping costs are included in 'Mining properties and leases' within 'Property, plant and equipment' or within 'Investments in equity accounted units', as appropriate. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in 'Depreciation of property, plant and equipment' within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\n## (i) Depreciation and impairment (notes 13 and 14)\n\n## Depreciation of non-current assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine or smelter or refinery if that is shorter and there is no reasonable alternative use for the asset by the Group.\n\nThe useful lives of the major assets of a cash-generating unit are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is the case, the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment are generally limited to the expected life of the orebody. The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where the major assets of a cash-generating unit are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies judgment in estimating the remaining service potential of long-lived assets. Factors affecting the remaining service potential of smelters include, for example, smelter technology and electricity purchase contracts when power is not sourced from the companies, or in some cases from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.\n\nThe useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and changes are reflected prospectively.\n\nDepreciation commences when an asset is available for use. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units of production and/or straight line basis as follows:\n\n## Units of production basis\n\nFor mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to production. Except as noted below, these assets are depreciated on the units of production basis.\n\n213",

Other mineral resources may be included in the calculations of total expected production in limited circumstances where there are very large areas of contiguous mineralisation, for which the economic viability is not sensitive to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore, bauxite and industrial mineral deposits, and where there is a high degree of confidence that the other mineral resources can be extracted economically. This would be the case when the other mineral resources do not yet have the status of ore reserves merely because the necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been performed and the responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of measured and indicated resources in the calculation of total expected production is appropriate based on historical reserve conversion rates.\n\nThe required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore (as compared with the above), such as copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be evaluated in detail before their economic status can be predicted with confidence.\n\nWhere measured and indicated resources are used in the calculation of depreciation for infrastructure, primarily rail and port, which will benefit current and future mines, then the measured and indicated resources may relate to mines which are currently in production or to mines where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of mineral resources is determined taking into account future capital costs as required by the JORC code. The depreciation calculation, however, applies to current mines only and does not take into account future development costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and indicated resources are currently incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group's Australian iron ore business.\n\n## Straight line basis\n\nAssets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis.\n\n## Impairment charges/reversals of non-current assets\n\nImpairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cashgenerating units which, in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets', are identified as the smallest identifiable asset or group of assets that generate cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. Separate cash-generating units are identified where an active market exists for intermediate products, even if the majority of those products are further processed internally. Impairment of financial assets is evaluated in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nIn some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent cash-generating streams which constitute separate cashgenerating units.\n\nGoodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the cashgenerating unit or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the related business combination, and tested for impairment at the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. All goodwill, intangible assets that have an indefinite life and intangible assets that are not ready for use are tested annually for impairment as at 30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.\n\n214\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Right of use assets recognised under IFRS 16 \"Leases\" are included in the review. The Group conducts an internal review of the asset values annually as at 30 September which is used as a source of information to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. External factors, such as changes in forecasted commodity prices, costs and other market factors as well as internal factors such as cancellation of a project or reduced project scope, are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. If any such indication exists then an impairment review is undertaken; the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit in its current condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD).\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is measured by reference to FVLCD, this amount is further classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with the unit of account for the cash-generating unit being tested. The Group considers that the best evidence of FVLCD is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement and, in this case, the recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1. When FVLCD is based on quoted prices for equity instruments but adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the recoverable amount is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. No cash-generating units are currently assessed for impairment by reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified as level 1 or level 2.\n\nWhere unobservable inputs are material to the measurement of the recoverable amount, FVLCD is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This is often estimated using discounted cash flow techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on detailed life-of-mine and/or long-term production plans. These may include anticipated expansions which are at the evaluation stage of study.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on management's best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, and closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of determining FVLCD from a market participant's perspective, the cash flows incorporate management's price and cost assumptions in the short and medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are assumed to remain constant where appropriate, as it is considered unlikely that a market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected to be realised from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Such non-reserve material is only included when there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing ore reserves. Typically, the additional evaluation required to achieve reserves status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation of the mine.\n\nAs noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or long-term production plan for the cash-generating unit. This differs from value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the asset in its current condition and therefore does not include future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset's performance. Anticipated enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD calculations and, therefore, generally result in a higher value.",

        "page_content": "Where the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is dependent on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect the current life of mine and/or long-term production plans, which are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody, including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of the ore impacting process recoveries and capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine plan and/or longterm production plans are, therefore, the basis for forecasting production output and production costs in each future year.\n\nForecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes are generally based on Rio Tinto's commodity price forecasts, which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of the longterm price, generally over a period of three to five years. For most commodities, these forecast commodity prices are derived from a combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and of the incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group does not believe that published medium- and long-term forward prices necessarily provide a good indication of future levels because they tend to be strongly influenced by spot prices. The price forecasts used for ore reserve estimation are generally consistent with those used for impairment testing unless management deems that in certain economic environments, a market participant would not assume Rio Tinto's view on prices, in which case in preparing FVLCD impairment calculations management estimates the assumptions that a market participant would be expected to use.\n\nForecast future cash flows of a cash-generating unit take into account the sales prices under existing sales contracts.\n\nThe discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The Group's weighted average cost of capital is generally used as a starting point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual cash-generating units operate. For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the Group's weighted average cost of capital, are used. For developments funded with project finance, the debt component of the weighted average cost of capital may be calculated by reference to the specific interest rate of the project finance and anticipated leverage of the project.\n\nFor operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency. In estimating FVLCD, internal forecasts of exchange rates take into account spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts, and are kept constant in real terms after five years. The great majority of the Group's sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without an increase in commodity prices, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced. Management considers that over the long term, there is a tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, and vice versa. However, such compensating changes are not synchronised and do not fully offset each other. In estimating value in use, the present value of future cash flows in foreign currencies is translated at the spot exchange rate on the testing date.\n\nNon-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed using the same basis for valuation as explained above whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate, an impairment reversal will be recognised. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit after reversal must be the lower of (a) the recoverable amount, as calculated above, and (b) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior periods.\n\nAn onerous contract is defined under IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets' as a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Provision is made when the assets dedicated to the contract are fully impaired or the contract becomes stranded as a result of a business decision.\n\n## (j) Determination of ore reserve and mineral resource estimates\n\nThe Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the JORC code.\n\nOre reserves and, for certain mines, other mineral resources, determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges and for forecasting the timing of the payment of close-down and restoration costs and the recovery of deferred tax assets. The depreciation and impairment policy above notes instances in which mineral resources are taken into account for accounting purposes. In addition, value may be attributed to mineral resources in purchase price allocations undertaken for the purposes of business combination accounting.\n\n## (k) Leases (notes 14, 21, 22)\n\nIFRS 16 'Leases' applies to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Certain leases are exempt from the standard, including leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. The Group does not apply IFRS 16 to arrangements which fall within the scope of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'.\n\nA significant proportion by value of the Group's lease arrangements relate to dry bulk vessels and offices. Other leases include land and non-mining rights, warehouses, ports, equipment and vehicles. The majority of lease terms are negotiated through the Group's procurement function, although agreements contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.\n\nThe Group recognises all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets, with the exception of short-term (12 months or fewer) and low value leases, on the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of: fixed payments; variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option which the Group can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined. For lease agreements relating to vessels, ports and properties, non-lease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and recorded separately within operating costs on a straight line basis. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right of use asset arising from a lease arrangement at initial recognition reflects the lease liability, initial direct costs, lease payments made before the commencement date of the lease, and capitalised provision for dismantling and restoration, less any lease incentives.\n\n215",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nThe Group recognises depreciation of right of use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest portion (which the Group presents in operating activities) in the cash flow statement. Payments made before the commencement date are included within financing activities unless they in substance represent investing cash flows, for example where precommencement cash flows are significant relative to aggregate cash flows of the leasing arrangement.\n\n## (l) Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (note 25)\n\nThe Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. These provisions are based on all regulatory requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinitelived water rights from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.\n\nClose-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred in the years following closure of the mine, refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their costs using current restoration standards and techniques.\n\nClose-down and restoration costs are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs, based on the net present value of the estimated future costs of restoration to be incurred during the life of the operation and post closure. Where appropriate, the provision is estimated using probability weighting of the different remediation and closure scenarios. The obligation may occur during development or during the production phase of a facility.\n\nProvisions for close-down and restoration costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from future disturbance.\n\nThe costs are estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are reviewed at each reporting period during the life of the operation to reflect known developments. The estimates are also subject to formal review, with appropriate external support, at regular intervals.\n\nThe initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment'. Subsequent movements in the closedown and restoration provisions for ongoing operations, including those resulting from new disturbance related to expansions or other activities qualifying for capitalisation, updated cost estimates, changes to the estimated lives of operations, changes to the timing of closure activities and revisions to discount rates are also capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment'. These costs are then depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate.\n\nChanges in closure provisions relating to closed operations are charged/ credited to 'Net operating costs' in the income statement.\n\nWhere rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date and the cost is charged to the income statement.\n\nIn the context of current market volatility and uncertainty, the Group has taken a long-term view of interest rates into account in determining the appropriate discount rate for discounting of future costs for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations. The amortisation or 'unwinding' of the discount applied in establishing the provisions is charged to the income statement in each accounting period. The amortisation of the discount is shown within 'Finance items' in the income statement.\n\nIn some cases, Group companies make a contribution to trust funds in order to meet or reimburse future environmental and decommissioning costs. Amounts due for reimbursement from trust funds are not offset against the corresponding closure provision unless payments into the fund have the effect of passing the closure obligation to the trust.\n\nEnvironmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation, compensation and penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the balance sheet date. These costs are charged to 'Net operating costs', except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within 'Finance items'.\n\nRemediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used.\n\n## (m) Inventories (note 16)\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory. The cost of raw materials and consumable stores is the purchase price. The cost of partly-processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including:\n\n- - Labour costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore or the production of alumina and aluminium;\n- - The depreciation of mining properties and leases and of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore or the production of alumina and aluminium, copper and other refined products; and\n- - Production overheads.\n\nWork in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing. If there is significant uncertainty as to if and/or when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the ore is expensed as mined. If the ore will not be processed within 12 months after the balance sheet date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries, are calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data, and are periodically reassessed taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\n## (n) Taxation (note 9 and note 17)\n\nCurrent tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, Rio Tinto establishes provisions based on either: the Group's judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach.",

        "page_content": "Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12. The Group provides for deferred tax in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions including mining rights that, in general, are not eligible for income tax allowances. Provision for deferred tax is based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its income tax base (which may be nil). Even when there is no income tax base, the existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes is not usually taken into account in determining the deferred tax provision for the assets, unless they are classified as held for sale or it is determined for other reasons that the carrying amount is expected to be recovered primarily through disposal and not through use of the assets. Where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and off-setting temporary differences, Rio Tinto applies the Initial Recognition Exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognises neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences.  Primarily this occurs with new lease arrangements and changes in closure cost estimates for assets in operation .\n\n## (o) Post-employment benefits (note 42)\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and life insurance to retirees. In accordance with IAS 19, for post-employment defined benefit plans, the difference between the fair value of any plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.\n\nWhere appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions. In determining the extent to which a refund will be available the Group considers whether any third party, such as a trustee or pension committee, has the power to enhance benefits or to wind up a pension plan without the Group's consent.\n\nThe most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are the discount rate, the inflation rate and mortality rates. The discount rate is used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on plan assets. The discount rate used is the yield on high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post-employment obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a currency, the rate on government bonds is used. The inflation rate is used to project increases in future benefit payments for those plans that have benefits linked to inflation. The mortality rates are used to project the period over which benefits will be paid, which is then discounted to arrive at the net present value of the obligations.\n\nThe current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements are recognised in the income statement. The interest cost less interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement. All amounts charged to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. These are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\n## (p) Cash and cash equivalents (note 20)\n\nFor the purpose of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise: cash on hand, deposits held with banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments (mainly money market funds) that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities in the balance sheet.\n\nFurther detail on cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, is shown in note 20.\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.\n\n## (q) Financial instruments (note 29)\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or through the income statement (FVPL)) and those to be held at amortised cost.\n\nClassification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nManagement determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition. The Group's policy with regard to financial risk management is set out in note 29. Generally, the Group does not acquire financial assets for the purpose of selling in the short term.\n\nThe Group's business model is primarily that of 'hold to collect' (where assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows). When the Group enters into derivative contracts, these transactions are designed to reduce exposures relating to assets and liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.\n\n## (a) Financial assets held at amortised cost\n\nThis classification applies to debt instruments which are held under a hold to collect business model and which have cash flows that meet the 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) criteria.\n\nAt initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are recognised at their transaction price. Other financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus related transaction costs; they are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss on de-recognition or modification of a financial asset held at amortised cost is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (b) Financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n\nThis classification applies to the following financial assets:\n\n- - Debt instruments that are held under a business model where they are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and also for sale ('collect and sell') and which have cash flows that meet the SPPI criteria. An example would be where trade receivable invoices for certain customers were factored from time to time.\n- All movements in the fair value of these financial assets are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue (including transaction costs by applying the effective interest method), gains or losses arising on de-recognition and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the income statement. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative fair value gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement.\n- - Equity investments where the Group has irrevocably elected to present fair value gains and losses on revaluation in other comprehensive income. The election can be made for each individual investment; however it is not applicable to equity investments held for trading.\n\nFair value gains or losses on revaluation of such equity investments, including any foreign exchange component, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When the equity investment is derecognised, there is no reclassification of fair value gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the income statement. Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n217",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\n(c) Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) This classification applies to the following financial assets. In all cases, transaction costs are immediately expensed to the income statement.\n\n- - Debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group has a significant proportion of trade receivables with embedded derivatives for provisional pricing. These receivables are generally held to collect but do not meet the SPPI criteria and as a result must be held at FVPL. Subsequent fair value gains or losses are taken to the income statement. In addition, trade receivable invoices for certain customers which are routinely factored, in order to address credit risk and support value delivery through timelier realisation, are held at FVPL.\n- - Equity investments which are held for trading or where the FVOCI election has not been applied. All fair value gains or losses and related dividend income are recognised in the income statement.\n- - Derivatives which are not designated as a hedging instrument. All subsequent fair value gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities\n\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities (including trade payables but excluding derivative liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group participates in supply chain finance arrangements whereby vendors may elect to receive early payment of their invoice from a thirdparty bank by factoring their receivable from Rio Tinto. These arrangements do not modify the terms of the original liability with respect to either counterparty terms, settlement date or amount due. Utilisation of the early settlement facility is voluntary and at the vendors' discretion on an invoice-by-invoice basis. Financial liabilities subject to supply chain finance therefore continue to be classified as trade payables. At 31 December 2020, trade payables included US$551 million (2019: US$573 million) subject to early settlement election by vendors.\n\n## (iii) Impairment of financial assets\n\nA forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) review is required for: debt instruments measured at amortised cost or held at fair value through other comprehensive income; loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at fair value through profit or loss; lease receivables; and trade receivables that give rise to an unconditional right to consideration.\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9, the Group applies the 'simplified approach' to trade receivable balances and receivables relating to net investment in finance leases and the 'general approach' to all other financial assets. The general approach incorporates a review for any significant increase in counterparty credit risk since inception. The ECL reviews include assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss rates. For trade receivables and receivables relating to net investment in finance leases, the assessment takes into account the use of credit enhancements, for example, letters of credit. Impairments for undrawn loan commitments are reflected as a provision.\n\n## (iv) Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group applies the hedge accounting requirements under IFRS 9 and its hedging activities are discussed in note 29 with movements on hedging reserves disclosed in note 28. Where applicable, the Group may defer the costs of hedging including currency basis spreads, forward points and the time value of options.\n\n218\n\nPhase 1 amendments related to IBOR reform adopted in the comparative period allowed temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by the reform. Application of the temporary reliefs mean that IBOR reform does not result in termination of hedging relationships referencing an IBOR during the anticipated period of IBOR-related uncertainty. The principal relief which the Group has applied to its hedging portfolio is in the assumption that US LIBOR remains a separately identifiable component for the duration of the hedge; and the US LIBOR rates referenced by fixed-to-floating rate swaps in fair value hedge relationships do not change as the result of IBOR reform, preserving the economic relationship and allowing the related hedges to remain effective (refer to note 29 A (b) (v)).\n\n## (r) Share-based payments (note 41)\n\nThe fair value of the Group's share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with an offset to retained earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans.\n\nThe Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe terms of each plan are considered at the balance sheet date to determine whether the plan should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled. The Group does not operate any plans as cash-settled. However, the Performance Share Plan can, at the discretion of the directors, offer employees an equivalent amount in cash. This is not standard practice. In some jurisdictions, employees are granted cashsettled awards where equity-settled awards are prohibited by local laws and regulations. The value of these awards is immaterial.\n\nThe Group's equity-settled share plans are settled either by: the issuance of shares by the relevant parent company; the purchase of shares on market; or the use of shares held in treasury which were previously acquired as part of a share buy-back. If the cost of shares acquired to satisfy the plans differs from the expense charged, the difference is taken to retained earnings or other reserves, as appropriate.\n\n## (s) Share capital (notes 26 and 27)\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\n\nWhere any Group company purchases the Group's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. If purchased Rio Tinto plc shares are cancelled, an amount equal to the nominal value of the cancelled share is credited to the capital redemption reserve.\n\n## (t) Segment reporting (notes 2 and 3)\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The Group considers that Rio Tinto's Chief Executive is the CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.",

A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset or group of assets that generates independent cash inflows. Judgment is applied to identify the Group's CGUs, particularly when assets belong to integrated operations, and changes in CGUs could impact impairment charges and reversals. The most significant examples of this judgment are: in 2020,  the continued grouping of Rio Tinto Fer et Titane in Quebec, Canada and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) into a single CGU on the basis that they are vertically integrated operations with no active market for ilmenite; and in 2019, disaggregation of the Weipa bauxite mine and the downstream Gladstone alumina refineries (Yarwun and QAL) in Queensland, Australia into three separate CGUs on the basis of the ramp-up of the Amrun expansion at Weipa which increased bauxite exports such that the mine is now considered to generate largely independent cash inflows. Prior to 2019, the Weipa mine and Gladstone refineries were grouped into a single CGU. Management reviews these judgments on an annual basis as part of the annual internal review of asset values as described in note (i) above.\n\nExternal and internal factors are monitored for indicators of impairment and include an annual internal review of asset values as described in note (i) above. Judgment is required to determine whether the impact of adverse spot commodity price movements is significant and structural in nature. There were no material instances of this judgment resulting in an indicator of impairment as at  31 December 2020.\n\nGenerally, discounted cash flow models are used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs. In this case, significant judgment is required to determine the appropriate estimates and assumptions used and there is significant estimation uncertainty. In particular, for fair value less costs of disposal valuations, judgment is required to determine the estimates a market participant would use. The discounted cash flow model is most sensitive to the following estimates: the timing of project expansions; the cost to complete assets under construction; long-term commodity prices; production timing and recovery rates; exchange rates; operating costs; reserve and resource estimates; closure costs; discount rates; allocation of long-term contract revenues between CGUs; and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences. Some of these variables are unique to an individual CGU. Future changes in these variables may differ from management's expectations and may materially alter the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.\n\nNote (i) above also describes the Group's methodology for estimating longterm commodity prices, exchange rates and discount rates for impairment testing purposes. Note 6 outlines the significant judgments, assumptions and sensitivities made for both measuring the impairments recorded and for determining whether reversal of part or all of a previous impairment was appropriate. Judgments, assumptions and sensitivities in relation to the testing of CGUs containing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are outlined in notes 12 and 13 respectively.\n\n## (ii) Estimation of asset lives\n\nIntangible assets are considered to have indefinite lives (and therefore no related depreciation or amortisation charge) if, in the Group's judgment, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows. Factors that are considered in making this judgment include the existence of contractual rights for unlimited terms or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental costs can be expected for indefinite periods into the future in view of the Group's investment intentions. The most significant assessment of indefinite life applicable to intangible assets relates to contract based water rights in Canada acquired with Alcan, described further in note 13.\n\nThe useful lives of the major assets of a CGU are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. The life of the orebody will be determined on the basis of the life-of-mine plan which is based on the estimates of ore reserves as described on page 325.\n\n## (iii) Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (note 25)\n\nProvision is made for close-down, restoration and environmental costs when the obligation occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs required to satisfy the obligation. Management uses its judgment and experience to determine the potential scope of closure rehabilitation work required to meet the Group's legal, statutory and constructive obligations, and any other commitments made to stakeholders, and the options and techniques available to meet those obligations and estimate the associated costs and the likely timing of those costs. Significant judgment is also required to determine both the costs associated with that work and the other assumptions used to calculate the provision. External experts support the cost estimation process where appropriate but there remains significant estimation uncertainty.\n\nThe key judgment in applying this accounting policy is determining when an estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a closure provision.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinitelived water rights or power agreements for renewably sourced power with local governments.\n\nCost estimates are updated throughout the life of the operation; generally cost estimates must comply with the Group's Capital Project Framework once the operation is ten years from expected closure. This means, for example, that where an Order of Magnitude (OoM) study is required for closure it must be of the same standard as an OoM study for a new mine, smelter or refinery. As at 31 December 2020, there are 10 operations with remaining lives of under ten years before taking into account unapproved extensions. The largest recent closure study is at Rio Tinto Kennecott, which was completed during 2020; information available from this study at 31 December 2020 resulted in an increase to closure and environmental liabilities of US$74 million (2019: US$444 million).\n\nAdjustments are made to provisions when the range of possible outcomes becomes sufficiently narrow to permit reliable estimation. Depending on the materiality of the change, adjustments may require review and endorsement by the Group's Closure Steering Committee before the provision is updated.\n\nIn some cases, the closure study may indicate that monitoring and, potentially, remediation will be required indefinitely - for example ground water treatment. In these cases the underlying cash flows for the provision may be restricted to a period for which the costs can be reliably estimated, which on average is around 30 years. Where an alternative commercial arrangement to meet our obligations can be predicted with confidence, this period may be shorter.\n\n219",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nThe most significant assumptions and estimates used in calculating the provision are:\n\n- - Closure timeframes. The weighted average remaining lives of operations is shown in note 25. Some expenditure may be incurred before closure whilst the operation as a whole is in production.\n- - The length of any post-closure monitoring period. This will depend on the specific site requirements and the availability of alternative commercial arrangements; some expenditure can continue into perpetuity.  The Rio Tinto Kennecott closure and environmental remediation provision includes an allowance for ongoing monitoring and remediation costs, including ground water treatment, of approximately US$0.6 billion.\n- - The probability weighting of possible closure scenarios. The most significant impact of probability weighting is at the Pilbara operations (Iron Ore) relating to infrastructure and incorporates the expectation that some infrastructure will be retained by the relevant State authorities post closure. The assignment of probabilities to this scenario reduces the closure provision by US$1.2 billion.\n- - Appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate. On 30 September 2020, management reviewed the rate used for discounting provisions and reduced the discount rate by 0.5%. The discount rate by nature is subjective and therefore sensitivities are shown in note 25 for how the provision balance, which at 31 December 2020 was US$13.3 billion, would change if discounted at alternative discount rates were applied.\n\nThere is significant estimation uncertainty in the calculation of the provision and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including:\n\n- - Changes to the relevant legal or local/national government requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders;\n- - Review of remediation and relinquishment options;\n- - Additional remediation requirements identified during the rehabilitation;\n- - The emergence of new restoration techniques;\n- - Precipitation rates and climate change;\n- - Change in the expected closure date;\n- - Change in the discount rate; and\n- - The effects of inflation.\n\nExperience gained at other mine or production sites may also change expected methods or costs of closure, although elements of the restoration and rehabilitation of each site are relatively unique to a site. Generally, there is relatively limited restoration and rehabilitation activity and historical precedent elsewhere in the Group, or in the industry as a whole, against which to benchmark cost estimates.\n\nThe expected timing of expenditure can also change for other reasons, for example because of changes to expectations around ore reserves and mineral resources, production rates, renewal of operating licences or economic conditions.\n\nAs noted in note (l) above, changes in closure and restoration provisions for ongoing operations are usually capitalised and therefore will impact assets and liabilities but have no impact on profit or loss at the time the change is made. However, these changes will impact depreciation and the unwind of discount in future years. Changes in closure estimates at the Group's ongoing operations could result in a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12 months.\n\nChanges to closure cost estimates for closed operations, and changes to environmental cost estimates at any operation, would impact profit or loss; however, the Group does not consider that there is significant risk of a change in estimates for these liabilities causing a material adjustment to profit or loss in the next 12 months. Any new environmental incidents may require a material provision but cannot be predicted.\n\nProject specific risks are embedded within the cash flows which are based on a central case estimate of closure activities assuming that the obligation is fulfilled by the Group. These cash flows are then discounted using a discount rate specific to the class of obligations. The selection of appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate requires judgment. The 1.5% real rate currently used by the Group is based on a number of inputs including observable historical yields on 30 year US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), and consideration of findings by independent valuation experts.\n\n## (iv) Deferral of stripping costs (note 14)\n\nStripping of waste materials takes place throughout the production phase of a surface mine or pit. The identification of components within a mine and of the life of component strip ratios requires judgment and is dependent on an individual mine's design and the estimates inherent within that. Changes to that design may introduce new components and/or change the life of component strip ratios. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact ore reserves may also have an impact on the life of component strip ratios, even if they do not affect the mine's design. Changes to the life of component strip ratios are accounted for prospectively.\n\nThe Group's judgment as to whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations determines whether initial stripping of a pit is deemed to be pre-production or production phase stripping and, therefore, the amortisation base for those costs. The analysis depends on each mine's specific circumstances and requires judgment: another mining company could make a different judgment even when the fact pattern appears to be similar.\n\n## (v) Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business, including transfer pricing, indirect taxes and transaction related issues.\n\nUncertain tax provisions include the related interest and penalties for all matters worldwide based on the Group's judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach. The most significant judgments are in relation to transfer pricing matters.  Whilst the potential outcomes are highly variable our current expectation is that there will be no material change to the amounts provided in the 12 months from 31 December 2020.\n\n## (vi) Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets (note 17)\n\nThe Group has tax losses and other deductible temporary differences, mainly in Australian, Canadian, US and Mongolian taxable entities, that have the potential to reduce tax payments in future years. Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the availability of sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, the estimates of projected future taxable income of these taxable entities and after taking account of specific risk factors that are expected to affect the recovery of these assets including the risk of expiry of losses. Further information on deferred tax assets is given in note 17.\n\nIn addition to the risk of expiry of losses, the projections on which recovery of tax losses are based are subject to the same estimation uncertainty as noted in (i) above in relation to impairment. The key judgment in the application of this accounting policy is the recognition of deferred tax assets for losses where the operation is not currently profitable for tax purposes.",

        "page_content": "## (vii) Provision for onerous contracts\n\nProvision for an onerous contract is made only when the assets dedicated to that contract are fully impaired or the contract becomes stranded as a result of a business decision. Judgment is required in determining which assets are considered dedicated to a contract when there is optionality as to how the contract obligations can be settled. Key estimates are the cash flows associated with the contract and the discount rate assumption. The Group completed the disposal of its remaining coking coal assets in 2018 and has retained the onerous provisions made in past periods for rail infrastructure 'take or pay' contracts which were considered stranded. Refer to note 36. As at 31 December 2020, the balance of the provision was US$219 million (2019: US$284 million). In 2019, the Group's investment in the Escondida Joint Venture reduced by US$138 million relating to contractual payments under a power purchase agreement which became stranded and was judged to be onerous upon early cancellation in favour of renewable energy sources.\n\n## (viii) Identification of functional currencies\n\nThe functional currency for each subsidiary, unincorporated arrangement, joint operation and equity accounted unit, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Determination of functional currency involves significant judgment and other companies may make different judgments based on similar facts. For many of Rio Tinto's businesses, their functional currency is the currency of the country in which they operate. The Group reconsiders the functional currency of its businesses if there is a change in the underlying transactions, events or conditions which determine their primary economic environment.\n\nThe determination of functional currency is a key judgment which affects the measurement of non-current assets included in the balance sheet and, as a consequence, the depreciation and amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement and in equity. The Group applies judgment in determining whether settlement of certain intragroup loans is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and therefore whether the associated exchange gains and losses can be taken to equity. During 2020, A$14 billion of intragroup loans continued to meet these criteria; associated exchange gains and losses are taken to equity.\n\n## (ix) Basis of consolidation (notes 32-35)\n\nJudgment is sometimes required to determine whether after considering all relevant factors, the Group has control, joint control or significant influence over an entity or arrangement. Significant influence includes situations of collective control (see note 35 (a)). Other companies may make different judgments regarding the same entity or arrangement. The most significant instance of such a judgment by the Group is in the determination that Escondida is a joint venture, based on the nature of significant commercial decisions, including capital expenditure, which require approval by both Rio Tinto and its partner BHP.\n\n## (x) Contingencies (note 30)\n\nDisclosure is made of material contingent liabilities unless the possibility of any loss arising is considered remote based on the Group's judgment and legal advice. Contingent liabilities are quantified unless, in the Group's judgment, the amount cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nThe unit of account for claims is the matter taken as a whole and therefore when a provision has been recorded for the best estimate of the cost to settle the obligation there is no further contingent liability component. This means that when a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation from a single past event, a further contingent liability is not reported for the maximum potential exposure in excess of that already provided.  We also consider the requirements of IAS 1 and provide disclosure when there is a significant risk the value of assets or liabilities could materially change within the next 12 months.\n\n## (xi) Exclusions from underlying earnings (note 2)\n\nAs set out in note 2, certain items are excluded from net earnings/(loss) in arriving at underlying earnings in each period irrespective of materiality. In addition, there is a final judgmental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.\n\nThe exclusion of provisions for obligations, including impact of change in discount rate in respect of legacy operations was the only application of the judgmental category in 2020.\n\n## (xii) Funding of Oyu Tolgoi\n\nAs described in note 32(l), Turquoise Hill, a 50.8% subsidiary of Rio Tinto, has funded common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (\"Erdenes\"), a company controlled by the Mongolian government, which owns the 34% non-controlling interest in Oyu Tolgoi not owned by Turquoise Hill.  Funded amounts earn interest at an annual effective rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable via a pledge over Erdenes' share of future Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends; Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making payments directly to Turquoise Hill.\n\nSince these funding balances, including accrued interest, are expected to be recovered principally through dividends from Oyu Tolgoi or sale by Erdenes of its interests in Oyu Tolgoi, related amounts are recorded as a reduction to the net carrying value of non-controlling interests.\n\n## (xiii) Pilbara Iron Arrangements\n\nThe arrangements described in note 33 (c) to the accounts permit each of the partners to the joint operation to request the other to construct assets on their tenure to increase the capacity of the rail and port infrastructure network. The requesting partner's (Asset User's) share of the capacity of the network will increase by the capacity of the newly constructed asset but, generally, that capacity may be provided from any of the network assets. The Asset User will pay an annual charge (Committed Use Charge 'CUC') over a contractually specified period irrespective of usage of the network. The constructing partner (Asset Owner) has an ongoing obligation to make available capacity from those assets and to maintain the assets in good working order as required under relevant State Agreements and associated tenure.\n\nThe Group considered whether the CUC arrangements give rise to a lease between the Asset Owner and the Asset User. The conclusion that they do not is because there is no specified asset; rather the Asset User has a first priority right to the capacity in the CUC asset. This treatment was grandfathered on adoption of IFRS 16 \"Leases\" on 1 January 2019, following assessment under the preceding standards IAS 17 \"Leases\" and IFRIC 4 \"Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease\", with no change to the conclusion under IFRS 16 for subsequent expenditure subject to the existing CUC arrangements. Management considers that these arrangements are unique and has used judgment to apply the principles of IFRS to the accounting for the arrangements as described above. The obligation of the Asset Owner to make capacity available is fulfilled over time and not at a point in time. The CUC arrangement is therefore an executory contract as defined under IAS 37 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets' whereby neither party has performed any of its obligations, or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent, and so the CUC payments are expensed as incurred. An alternative interpretation of the fact pattern could have resulted in a gross presentation in the Group's balance sheet with an asset and a corresponding liability to reflect the present value of the CUC payments. The Asset User is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, whereas the Asset Owner is a joint operation. This impact would be some US$2 billion (calculated on the basis of grossing up the tax written down value of the CUC assets). Other methods of calculating the gross up might give rise to different numbers.\n\n221",

The discount rate is a key assumption and is based upon the yields on high quality corporate bonds in the relevant currency which have durations consistent with the term of the obligations. The discount rate will vary from one period to another in line with movements in corporate bond yields, but at any given measurement date there is relatively little estimation uncertainty. This rate is also used to calculate the interest cost on obligations and interest income on plan assets.\n\nThe following key assumptions are used to calculate the estimated benefit: future pay increases to be received by members of final pay plans, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form of inflation protection), current mortality rates and future improvements in mortality rates. The assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation linked instruments, where possible, combined with consensus views. The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses these rates to set its current mortality assumptions. It also uses its judgment with respect to allowances for future improvements in longevity having regard to standard improvement scales in each relevant country and after taking external actuarial advice.\n\nMost of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants and the majority of the obligations relate to former employees. The carrying value of the Group's post-employment obligations is therefore less sensitive to assumptions about future salary increases than it is to assumptions regarding future inflation.\n\nDetails of the key assumptions, how they have moved since the previous balance sheet date and the sensitivity of the carrying value to changes in the assumptions are set out in note 42.\n\n222",

Underlying earnings and net earnings both represent amounts net of tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto.\n\nThe following items are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying earnings in each period irrespective of materiality:\n\n- - Net gains/(losses) on disposal of interests in businesses.\n- - Impairment charges and reversals.\n- - Profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations.\n- - Exchange and derivative gains and losses. This exclusion includes exchange gains/(losses) on external net debt and intragroup balances, unrealised gains/(losses) on currency and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, unrealised gains/(losses) on certain commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, and unrealised gains/(losses) on embedded derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting.\n\nIn addition, there is a final judgmental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate with similar items, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA excludes the EBITDA impact of the same items that are excluded from underlying earnings.\n\nProduct group underlying earnings include the Group's share of the underlying earnings of subsidiaries and equity accounted units stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount on provisions.\n\nRio Tinto's share of the underlying earnings of equity accounted units amounted to US$656 million in 2020 (2019: US$302 million; 2018: US$513 million). This amount is attributable as follows: US$640 million profit to the Copper & Diamonds product group and US$16 million profit to other product groups (2019: US$292 million profit to the Copper & Diamonds product group and US$10 million profit to other product groups; 2018: US$476 million  profit to the Copper & Diamonds product group and US$37 million profit to other product groups). These amounts are included in underlying earnings and include the underlying earnings of the Group's tolling entities which process alumina. Tolling entities recharge the majority of their costs and generally have minimal earnings.\n\n225",

Pacific Aluminium, Australia and New Zealand\n\nOn 9 July 2020, we announced the conclusion of the NZAS strategic review and gave Meridian Energy 14 months' notice for the termination of the power contract. As a result of the decision to wind-down operations an impairment trigger was identified. The net present value of post-tax cash flows over the remaining life for this cash-generating unit (CGU) was negative and therefore the non-current assets of the smelter were fully impaired. On 14 January 2021 a new agreement was reached with Meridian Energy in relation to power prices, allowing NZAS to continue operating the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter until December 2024. The extension allows time for detailed closure studies to be completed and for NZAS to support the government and Southland community in planning for the future. We have evaluated and concluded that these updated circumstances are not a trigger for impairment reversal.\n\nThe high operating costs and challenging outlook for the aluminium industry have also resulted in impairment triggers being identified at the Bell Bay aluminium smelter in Tasmania, Australia and at Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia at 30 June 2020. Bell Bay has a power contract to 2025 with Hydro Tasmania and with the current market context the forecast net present value of cash flows over that period was negative. The property, plant and equipment of the Bell Bay smelter was therefore fully impaired.  We determined the recoverable amount for our share of the Boyne Smelter CGU which also includes the Gladstone Power Station as US$273 million based on post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 6.6%. Accordingly our share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$119 million (US$148 million pre-tax) related to the smelter and US$26 million (US$36 million pre-tax) related to the power station.\n\n## Aluminium - Sohar\n\nIn 2020, the challenging outlook for the Middle Eastern aluminium industry was identified as an impairment trigger at the Sohar aluminium smelter in Oman, an equity accounted unit of the Group.\n\nAt 30 September 2020 we determined the recoverable amount for our share of the Sohar CGU to be US$258 million based on post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 7.6%. Accordingly our share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$220 million.\n\n229",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 6 Impairment charges continued\n\n## Aluminium - ISAL smelter, Iceland\n\nIn 2018, we reached agreement with Hydro to sell the ISAL smelter in Iceland, our 53.3% interest in the Aluchemie anode plant in the Netherlands and our 50% share in the Aluminium fluoride plant in Sweden (ISAL). The anticipated headline sales price of US$345 million was lower than the carrying value of these assets, leading us to recognise an impairment charge of US$123 million. This was based on a fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) model, against property, plant and equipment and acquired software. Subsequently, Hydro withdrew its offer.\n\nIn 2019, these assets no longer met the accounting criteria to be classified as assets held for sale. Accordingly these non-current assets were tested for impairment. We calculated the recoverable amount for the CGUs based on the IAS 36 value-in-use methodology by reference to the net present value of post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 6.9%. These were US$302 million for the CGU comprising ISAL and Aluchemie and US$46 million for Alufluor. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of US$109 million allocated to property, plant and equipment and intangibles in the ISAL and Aluchemie CGU.\n\nIn February 2020 we announced a strategic review of the ISAL smelter in Iceland and the challenging market conditions were identified as an impairment trigger. The net present value of cash flows projected over the remaining life for this CGU did not support retaining any carrying value for the non-current assets of the CGU, which were fully impaired following a pre-tax impairment charge of US$204 million in the first half of 2020.\n\nDuring subsequent negotiations Landsvirkjun tabled an improved offer for power delivery, restoring the competitiveness of the smelter over its remaining life. We have concluded these updated circumstances, represent an indicator of partial impairment reversal.  When combined with improved pricing since the half year we have calculated a recoverable amount of US$139 million based on the IAS 36 fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) methodology, discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 6.6% expressed in real terms. As a result we have reversed previously recorded pre-tax impairment of US$111 million reflected as an adjustment to the impairment charge recognised in the first half of 2020.\n\n## Copper & Diamonds - Diavik, Canada\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the global demand for diamonds with many countries restricting the movement of citizens and closing retail outlets. Our 40% joint venture partner at the Diavik diamond mine filed for creditor protection in April 2020 and has since defaulted on its cash calls. Together these circumstances were identified as an impairment trigger. The net present value of post-tax cash flows projected over the remaining life of the Diavik diamond mine to 2025 did not support retaining any carrying value for the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of the CGU, which have therefore been fully impaired.\n\n## Copper & Diamonds - Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nOn 16 July 2019 we announced that the first sustainable production from the Oyu Tolgoi underground project could be delayed by 16 to 30 months compared with the original feasibility study guidance in 2016. We also announced that development capital spend for the project may increase by between US$1.2 billion and US$1.9 billion in excess of the US$5.3 billion previously disclosed.\n\nWe identified these matters as an impairment trigger and prepared an assessment of the recoverable amount for the CGU at 30 June 2019 using a FVLCD model, as prescribed by IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.\n\nIn arriving at a recoverable amount, as at 30 June 2019, we estimated post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms over the current life of mine plus anticipated future expansions, utilising mineral resources. The mineral resources incorporate almost two billion tonnes of ore, which contributes approximately 20% to the total recoverable amount. We discounted the cash flows using a post-tax discount rate of 8.3% expressed in real terms. Due to the inputs used, the recoverable amount of the Oyu Tolgoi CGU was classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.\n\nAt 30 June 2019 we determined the recoverable amount to be US$8.3 billion on a post-tax basis which resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of US$2.2 billion (100% basis). This was allocated to mining properties and the underground development assets under construction. The net adjustment to tax represented an increase to deferred tax assets of US$320 million for the temporary difference corresponding to the impairment and a decrease in deferred tax assets of US$359 million for tax losses that were expected to expire without utilisation.\n\nSince June 2019, the carrying value of Oyu Tolgoi on the same basis has increased to US$10.1 billion (100% basis), mainly due to capital expenditure completed in the interim.  The execution of this capital expenditure also results in a corresponding increase in the value of the asset over this period. Prior to completion of the underground project, the net present value of cash flows also increases by approximately US$1.1 billion per annum due to unwinding of the discount for the time value of money.  Such valuation increases are not indicative of impairment reversal.\n\nOn 16 December 2020 we confirmed the completion of the Definitive Estimate and selection of a preferred development option for the Oyu Tolgoi underground project. Development capital assumptions of US$6.75 billion and forecast sustainable production by October 2022 incorporate the impacts of COVID-19. The latest information is within the range of assumptions used to calculate the CGU's recoverable amount in the most recent impairment test, described above, and is not indicative of an impairment loss. The next major milestone for the project development is the undercut, scheduled for mid-2021, which initiates the caving process.  Study work also continues on the Panel 1 and Panel 2 sections of the underground, with initial recommendations expected mid-2021. These studies will also consider options and associated costs to recover the copper and gold contained within the pillars added to the mine design of Panel 0.\n\n230",

        "page_content": "On 4 January 2021, the Government of Mongolia advised Rio Tinto that they were dissatisfied with the results of the Definitive Estimate and the funding implications for the sharing of economic benefits between the shareholders of Oyu Tolgoi LLC. The Government has also stressed the importance of achieving a comprehensive solution which addresses the social issues of importance to Mongolia, such as water usage and the tax matters which have been referred to International Arbitration. We are engaging with the Government in relation to the definitive estimate and are in active discussions with them to address and close all outstanding issues and increase the project's benefit to all stakeholders. Should future negotiations with the Government of Mongolia result in changes to the operating cash profile of the assets, an impairment test may be necessary.\n\nThe funding of equity contributions to the project have been accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy in note 1 (xii) and additional information regarding the lending certificates and non-controlling interests are provided in note 32.\n\n## Aluminium - Yarwun alumina refinery\n\nIn 2019, our annual impairment assessment of the Yarwun CGU resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of US$1,138 million to property, plant and equipment as a result of this CGU being assessed on a stand-alone basis for the first time and a 30% year-on-year reduction in the spot price of alumina to US$275/t at 31 December 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to monitor the Yarwun CGU closely for additional indicators of impairment given the limited headroom as a consequence of previous impairment, together with the sensitivity of the valuation to movements in the alumina price and headwinds faced by the aluminium sector since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe have considered the impact of recent volatility in the alumina spot price through 2020, noting its recovery from a low of US$226/t in June 2020 to over US$300/t by the end of the year, as well as valuation upside attributable to a reduction in input costs over the period under review.  No impairment triggers have been identified in 2020 and the carrying value remains supportable.\n\n## 7 Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units\n\n|                                                     | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   | 2018 US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Sales revenue: Rio Tinto share (a)                  | 2,490        | 2,358       | 2,497       |\n| Operating costs                                     | (1,439)      | (1,812)     | (1,656)     |\n| Profit before finance items and taxation            | 1,051        | 546         | 841         |\n| Finance items                                       | (59)         | (65)        | (69)        |\n| Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units | 23           | 10          | 14          |\n| Profit before taxation                              | 1,015        | 491         | 786         |\n| Taxation                                            | (363)        | (190)       | (273)       |\n| Profit for the year (Rio Tinto share)               | 652          | 301         | 513         |\n\nFurther information relating to the Group's interests in joint ventures and associates is given in notes 34 and 35.\n\n## 8 Finance income and finance costs\n\n|                                                                                                      | Note   | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   | 2018 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Finance income from equity accounted units                                                           |        | 4            | 4           | 7           |\n| Other finance income (including bank deposits, net investment in leases, and other financial assets) |        | 137          | 296         | 242         |\n| Total finance income                                                                                 |        | 141          | 300         | 249         |\n| Interest on:                                                                                         |        |              |             |             |\n| - Financial liabilities at amortised cost (excluding lease liabilities) and associated derivatives   |        | (561)        | (816)       | (775)       |\n| - Lease liabilities                                                                                  |        | (50)         | (55)        | (2)         |\n| Fair value movements:                                                                                |        |              |             |             |\n| - Bonds designated as hedged items in fair value hedges                                              |        | (284)        | (185)       | 96          |\n| - Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in fair value hedges                                 |        | 287          | 181         | (73)        |\n| Loss on early redemption of bonds (a)                                                                |        | -            | -           | (94)        |\n| Amounts capitalised                                                                                  | 14     | 340          | 321         | 296         |\n| Total finance costs                                                                                  |        | (268)        | (554)       | (552)       |\n\n231",

The dividend will be paid on 15 April 2021 to Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders on the register at the close of business on 5 March 2021.\n\nThe proposed Rio Tinto Limited dividends will be franked out of existing franking credits or out of franking credits arising from the payment of income tax during 2021.\n\nThe approximate amount of the Rio Tinto Limited consolidated tax group's retained profits and reserves that could be distributed as dividends and franked out of available credits that arose from net payments of income tax in respect of periods up to 31 December 2020 (after deducting franking credits expected to be utilised on the 2020 final and special dividends declared) is US$11,014 million (2019: US$8,599 million; 2018: US$6,178 million).\n\n## 12 Goodwill\n\n|                                    | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Net book value                     |              |             |\n| At 1 January                       | 922          | 912         |\n| Adjustment on currency translation | 24           | 10          |\n| At 31 December                     | 946          | 922         |\n| -  cost                            | 17,341       | 16,926      |\n| -  accumulated impairment          | (16,395)     | (16,004)    |\n| At 1 January                       |              |             |\n| -  cost                            | 16,926       | 15,861      |\n| -  accumulated impairment          | (16,004)     | (14,949)    |\n\nAt 31 December, goodwill has been allocated as follows:\n\n|                       | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Net book value        |              |             |\n| Richards Bay Minerals | 468          | 487         |\n| Pilbara               | 383          | 349         |\n| Dampier Salt          | 95           | 86          |\n|                       | 946          | 922         |\n\n234",

The recoverable amount has been assessed by reference to fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD), in line with the policy set out in note 1(i) and classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. FVLCD was determined by estimating cash flows until the end of the life-of-mine plan including anticipated expansions. In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 8.6% (2019: 8.6%) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.\n\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Richards Bay Minerals is most sensitive and the corresponding decrease in FVLCD are set out below:\n\n|                                                                 |   US$m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 5% decrease in the titanium slag price                          |    182 |\n| 1% increase in the discount rate applied to post-tax cash flows |    213 |\n| 10% strengthening of the South African rand                     |    393 |\n\nOther assumptions include the long-term pig iron and zircon prices and operating costs. Future selling prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 1(i). The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the carrying value when each of these sensitivities are applied whilst keeping all other assumptions constant.\n\n## Pilbara\n\nThe annual impairment review of the Pilbara CGU has been assessed by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows, which is in line with the policy set out in note 1(i) and is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2019: 6.6%) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms. The recoverable amount was determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining goodwill to be impaired.\n\n## 13 Intangible assets\n\n| Year ended 31 December 2020               | Exploration and  evaluation (a) US$m   | Trademarks,  patented and  non-patented  technology US$m   | Contract  based  intangible assets (b) US$m   | Other  intangible  assets US$m   | Total US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Net book value                            |                                        |                                                            |                                               |                                  |              |\n| At 1 January 2020                         | 173                                    | 44                                                         | 1,947                                         | 473                              | 2,637        |\n| Adjustment on currency translation        | 17                                     | 3                                                          | 56                                            | 35                               | 111          |\n| Expenditure during the year               | 87                                     | -

The water rights are expected to contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of operations for the foreseeable future; accordingly, these rights are considered to have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. These water rights constitute the majority of the amounts in 'Contract based intangible assets'.\n\nThe remaining carrying value of the water rights of  US$1,798 million as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: US$1,759 million) relates wholly to the Quebec smelters cash-generating unit (CGU). The Quebec smelters CGU was tested for impairment by reference to fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) using discounted cash flows, which is in line with the policy set out in note 1(i). The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been estimated over the expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2019: 6.6%).\n\n- The recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining water rights to be impaired.\n- (c) Finite life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Where amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis, the following useful lives have been determined:\n\nTrademarks, patented and non-patented technology:\n\n- Trademarks: 14 to 20 years\n\nPatented and non-patented technology: ten to 20 years\n\nContract-based intangible assets:\n\nPower contracts/water rights: two to 45 years\n\nOther purchase and customer contracts: five to 15 years\n\n- Other intangible assets:\n- Internally generated intangible assets and computer software: two to five years\n- Other intangible assets: two to 20 years\n- (d) Impairment charges in 2020 relate to the Diavik diamond mine.

Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their respective costs based on current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions.\n\nProvisions of US$13,335 million (2019: US$11,090 million) for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations are based on riskadjusted cash flows. The Group completed a review of the discount rate used to present value the obligations on 30 September 2020 and updated it to a real-rate of 1.5%, applied prospectively from that date. Prior to 30 September 2020 and in recent years, the close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were discounted at a real-rate of 2.0%. To illustrate the sensitivity of the provision to discounting, if the discount rate at 31 December 2020 was decreased to 1.0% then the provision would be US$1.3 billion higher, of which approximately US$1.2 billion would be capitalised within \"Property, plant and equipment\" at operating sites and US$0.1 billion would be charged to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites.  If the discount rate was increased to 3.0% then the provision would be US$2.6 billion lower, of which approximately US$2.4 billion would result in a decrease within \"Property, plant and equipment\" at operating sites and US$0.2 billion would be credited to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites.\n\n| Closure cost composition as at 31 December         | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Decommissioning, decontamination and demolition    | 3,131        | 2,066       |\n| Closure and rehabilitation earthworks  (a)         | 4,223        | 3,889       |\n| Long-term water management costs  (b)              | 966          | 920         |\n| Post closure monitoring and maintenance            | 1,318        | 855         |\n| Indirect costs, owners' costs and contingency  (c) | 3,697        | 3,360       |\n| Total                                              | 13,335       | 11,090      |\n\nThe underlying costs for closure have been estimated with varying degrees of accuracy based on a function of the age of the underlying asset and proximity to closure. For assets within ten years of closure, closure plans and cost estimates are supported by detailed studies which are refined as the closure date approaches. These closure studies consider climate change and plan for resilience to expected climate conditions with a particular focus on precipitation rates. For new developments, consideration of climate change and ultimate closure conditions are an important part of the approval process. For longer-lived assets, closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every five years; these are evolving to incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.\n\n| Geographic composition as at 31 December   | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Australia                                  | 7,076        | 5,610       |\n| USA                                        | 3,819        | 3,377       |\n| Canada                                     | 1,482        | 1,267       |\n| Rest of World                              | 958          | 836         |\n| Total                                      | 13,335       | 11,090      |\n\nThe geographic composition of the closure provision shows that our closure obligations are largely in countries with established levels of regulation in respect of mine and site closure.\n\n245",

We do not seek to hedge this floating exposure and will re-float, where possible, any material price or rates that are fixed. Where this is impossible (or sub-optimal) any non-floating price risks are managed within defined market risk tolerances. Derivatives are used as and when required in order to manage our exposure in accordance with this underlying financial risk management principle.\n\nIn the paragraphs below, we summarise the risks that we are exposed to, and outline how our Treasury and Commercial teams manage these risks in accordance with agreed policies. These teams operate under a strong control environment, within approved limits. Our Board reviews and approves limits at least annually.\n\n## (i) Capital and liquidity risk\n\nOur overriding objective when managing capital and liquidity is to safeguard the business as a going concern. Capital is allocated in a consistent and disciplined manner, prioritising sustaining capital expenditure, followed by the ordinary dividend and then an iterative allocation between investing in compelling growth opportunities, maintaining balance sheet strength and delivering further returns to shareholders.\n\nOur Board and senior management regularly review the capital structure and liquidity of the Group. They take into account our strategic priorities, the economic and business conditions, and any identified investment opportunities, along with the expected returns to shareholders. We expect total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40-60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the commodity cycle.\n\nWe consider various financial metrics when managing our risk, including net debt, gearing, the overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile, liquidity levels, total capital, future cash flows, underlying EBITDA and interest cover ratios.\n\nOur total capital as at 31 December was:\n\n| Total capital                                                              | Note   | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (see Group balance sheet)       |        | 47,054       | 40,532      |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests (see Group balance sheet) |        | 4,849        | 4,710       |\n| Net debt                                                                   | 23     | 664          | 3,651       |\n| Total capital                                                              |        | 52,567       | 48,893      |\n\nOur net debt decreased to US$0.7 billion at 31 December 2020 from  US$3.7 billion at 31 December 2019. This was driven by operating cash inflows, partially offset by capital expenditure and cash returns to shareholders during the year. At 31 December 2020 net gearing was 1% (2019: 7%) and interest cover was 39 times (2019: 28 times).\n\nWe have access to various forms of financing including our US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance Programme, Commercial Paper and credit facilities. We did not issue any debt in 2020 or 2019 under these programmes.\n\nWe have US$7.5 billion fully committed Revolving Credit Facilities, which were extended in 2020 to November 2023 and remained undrawn throughout the year. The funds available can be used for general corporate purposes. Advances under these revolving facilities bear an interest rate per annum based on LIBOR (or EURIBOR, CDOR or BBSW in relation to any euro, Canadian dollar or Australian dollar loans respectively) plus a margin (which is dependent on our long-term credit rating as determined by Moody's and Standard & Poor's and the level of drawdown). The facility agreements contain no financial covenants.\n\nOur credit ratings, as provided by Standard & Poor's and Moody's investor services, as at 31 December were:\n\n|                   | 2020          | 2019          |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Long-term rating  | A/A2          | A/A2          |\n| Short-term rating | A-1/P-1       | A-1/P-1       |\n| Outlook           | Stable/Stable | Stable/Stable |\n\nOur unified credit status is maintained through cross guarantees, which mean the contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are automatically guaranteed by the other.\n\n250",

Agreements with derivative counterparties are based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances. During the year, there were no material amounts offset in the balance sheet.\n\n## (ii) Commodity price risk\n\nOur broad commodity base means our exposure to commodity prices is diversified. Our normal policy is to sell our products at prevailing market prices. Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid down by the Board, and to defined market risk tolerances and internal controls.\n\nWe sell our products to customers under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold in the spot market. Sales revenue may be subject to adjustment if product specifications do not conform to the terms specified in a sales contract.\n\nPricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms. We sell a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes on the spot market.\n\n251",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2020 Financial Statements\n\n## 29 Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## (ii) Commodity price risk (continued)\n\nWe generally sell copper and aluminium under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, with some volumes sold in the spot market. The prices are determined by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets, such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Commodities Exchange (COMEX) in New York. Prices fluctuate widely in response to changing levels of supply and demand but, in the long run, prices are related to the marginal cost of supply. Gold is also priced in an active market in which prices respond to daily changes in quantities offered and sought. Newly mined gold is only one source of supply; investment and disinvestment can be important elements of supply and demand.\n\nAt the date revenue is recognised, certain of our products are provisionally priced, based on the amount we expect to receive in the future. After initial recognition of revenue, we record any change in revenue relating to market prices separately in \"Other revenue\" (refer to note 3). Substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices at each reporting period. Final prices for copper concentrate, however, are normally determined between 30 and 180 days after delivery to our customer.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, we had 261 million pounds of copper sales, including share of equity accounted unit (31 December 2019: 220 million pounds), that were provisionally priced at US 336 cents per pound (2019: US 271 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2021. A 10% change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, all other factors held constant, would increase or reduce net earnings by US$58 million (2019: US$38 million).\n\nFor some products, particularly aluminium, we are also exposed to fluctuations in power prices.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nWe do not generally consider that using derivatives to fix commodity prices would provide a long-term benefit to our shareholders. However, for certain physical commodity transactions for which the price was fixed at the contract date, we enter into derivatives to achieve the prevailing market prices at the point of revenue recognition.\n\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in the relationship between aluminium prices and power prices, we have a number of electricity purchase contracts which are directly linked to the daily official LME cash ask price for high grade aluminium ('LME price') and to the US Midwest Transaction Premium ('Midwest premium').\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, we apply hedge accounting to two embedded derivatives within our power contracts. The embedded derivatives (notional aluminium forward sales) have been designated as the hedging instrument. The forecasted aluminium sales, priced using the LME price and the Midwest premium, represent the hedged item.\n\nThe hedging ratio is 1:1, as the quantity of sales designated as being hedged matches the notional amount of the hedging instrument. The hedging instrument's notional amount, expressed in equivalent metric tonnes of aluminium, is derived from our expected electricity consumption under the power contracts as well as other relevant contract parameters.\n\nWhen we designate such embedded derivatives as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, we recognise the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, and it is accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. The amount that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the lesser of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, in absolute terms.\n\nWe recognise any ineffectiveness relating to the hedging relationship immediately in the income statement.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include: differences in the timing of the cash flows between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, non-zero initial fair value of the hedging instrument, the existence of a cap on the Midwest premium in the hedging instrument and counterparty credit risk.\n\nWe held the following notional aluminium forward sales contracts embedded in the power contracts:\n\n| At 31 December 2020                    | Total   | Within 1 year   | Between 1  and 5 years   | Between 5  and 10 years   | After 10 years   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Notional amount (in tonnes)            | 640,963 | 72,548          | 287,587                  | 280,828                   | -                |\n| Notional amount (in US$ millions)      | 1,522   | 159             | 663                      | 701                       | -                |\n| Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne) | 2,375   | 2,189           | 2,305                    | 2,495                     | -                |\n| At 31 December 2019                    | Total   | Within 1 year   | Between 1  and 5 years   | Between 5  and 10 years   | After 10 years   |\n| Notional amount (in tonnes)            | 704,370 | 65,226          | 286,617                  | 352,527                   | -                |\n| Notional amount (in US$ millions)      | 1,656   | 138             | 647                      | 871                       | -                |\n| Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne) | 2,351   | 2,114           | 2,257                    | 2,471                     | -                |\n\n252",

The table below summarises the impact that changes in aluminium market prices have on aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in power supply agreements outstanding at 31 December 2020. Any change in price will result in an offsetting change in our future earnings.\n\n|                        | Change in market prices   | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Effect on net earnings | +10 %                     | (19)         | (28)        |\n|                        | (10) %                    | 19           | 27          |\n| Effect on equity       | +10 %                     | (98)         | (97)        |\n| Effect on equity       | (10) %                    | 100          | 101         |\n\nWe exclude our 'own use contracts' from this sensitivity analysis as they are outside the scope of IFRS 9. Our business units continue to hold these types of contracts to satisfy their expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our operating activities (primarily from customer trade receivables); and from our investing activities (primarily investments in separately managed funds). We are also exposed to credit risk arising from our deposits in treasury and liquidity funds, deposits with banks and financial institutions and from our interest rate and currency derivative contracts.\n\n## Credit risks related to receivables\n\nOur Commercial team manages customer credit risk subject to our established policy, procedures and controls. The team establishes credit limits for all of our customers. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used as a guide to set credit limits. Where there are no independent credit ratings available, we assess the credit quality of the customer through a credit rating model and assign appropriate credit limit. The Commercial team monitors outstanding customer receivables regularly and highlights any credit concerns to senior management. Receivables to high risk customers are often secured by letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement.\n\nThe expected credit loss on our trade receivable portfolio is insignificant (see note 18).\n\n## Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits\n\nOur Treasury team manages credit risk from investments in government securities (primarily US Government), corporate and asset-backed securities, reverse re-purchase agreements, money market funds, and balances with banks and financial institutions in accordance with a Board-approved credit risk framework which sets the risk appetite. Our Board reviews this annually. We make investments of surplus funds only with approved investment grade (BBB- and above) counterparties who have been assigned specific credit limits. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through counterparty failure.\n\n253",

The US dollar, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar are the most important currencies influencing our costs. In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial results. A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies in which our costs are partly denominated has a positive effect on our underlying earnings. However, a strengthening of the US dollar reduces the value of non-US dollar denominated net assets, and therefore total equity.\n\nOur external borrowings and cash are mainly denominated in US dollars, either directly or through the use of derivatives, as we consider the US dollar the most appropriate currency for financing our operations.\n\nIn most cases our debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, is held in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. There are instances where these balances are held in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This means we recognise exchange gains and losses in our income statement (except where they can be taken to equity) as these balances are translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. Our income statement also includes exchange gains and losses arising on US dollar net debt and intragroup balances. On consolidation, these balances are retranslated to our US dollar presentation currency and there is a corresponding and offsetting exchange difference recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. There is no impact on total equity.\n\nThe table below summarises, by currency, our net debt, after taking into account relevant cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts:\n\n| Net debt by currency   | Total borrowings excluding overdrafts US$m   | Lease  liabilities US$m   | Derivatives related to net debt US$m   | Cash and cash equivalents US$m   | Other investments US$m   | Net debt 2020 US$m   | Net debt 2019 US$m   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| US dollar              | (12,102)                                     | (342)                     | 248                                    | 9,517                            | 2,538                    | (141)                | (2,843)              |\n| Australian dollar      | (375)                                        | (350)                     | -                                      | 439                              | -                        | (286)                | (561)                |\n| Euro                   | (4)                                          | (25)                      | -                                      | 43                               | -                        | 14                   | 10                   |\n| South African rand     | -                                            | (1)                       | -                                      | 141                              | -                        | 140                  | 171                  |\n| Canadian dollar        | (170)                                        | (199)                     | -                                      | 36                               | -                        | (333)                | (322)                |\n| Other                  | (2)                                          | (261)                     | -                                      | 205                              | -                        | (58)                 | (106)                |\n| Total                  | (12,653)                                     | (1,178)                   | 248                                    | 10,381                           | 2,538                    | (664)                | (3,651)              |\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nUnder normal market conditions, we do not consider that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term benefits to shareholders. We review our exposure on a regular basis and will undertake hedging if deemed appropriate. We may deem currency protection measures appropriate in specific commercial circumstances. Capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as acquisitions, disposals, tax and dividend cash flows may be economically hedged subject to strict limits laid down by the Board. Details of the cross-currency interest rate swaps and the currency forward contracts used to manage our currency risk exposures at 31 December 2020 are in section B.\n\n254",

We deem 10% to be the annual exchange rate movement that is reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for any of our significant currencies and therefore an appropriate representation.\n\nWe calculate sensitivities in relation to the functional currencies of our individual entities. We translate the impact of these on net earnings and underlying earnings into US dollars at the exchange rates on which the sensitivities are based. The impact to net earnings associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency, shown below, is broadly offset within equity through movements in the currency translation reserve and therefore generally has no impact on our net assets. The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings, underlying earnings, and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation. The sensitivities are based on financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2020, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain constant throughout 2021, and therefore the following information should be used with care.\n\n## At 31 December 2020\n\nGains/(losses) associated with 10% strengthening of the US dollar\n\n| Currency exposure   |   Closing exchange rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m   | Of which amount impacting underlying earnings US$m   | Impact  directly on equity US$m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Australian dollar   |                               77 | 625                           | (11)                                                 | (1,105)                           |\n| Canadian dollar     |                               78 | (167)                         | 6                                                    | -                                 |\n| Euro                |                              123 | 139                           | 3                                                    | -                                 |\n\nAt 31 December 2019\n\nGains/(losses) associated with 10% strengthening of the US dollar\n\n| Currency exposure   |   Closing exchange rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m   | Of which amount impacting underlying earnings US$m   | Impact directly on equity US$m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Australian dollar   |                               70 | 453                           | (4)                                                  | (1,002)                          |\n| Canadian dollar     |                               77 | (143)                         | 7                                                    | -                                |\n| Euro                |                              112 | 178                           | 4                                                    | -                                |\n\n## (v) Interest rate risk\n\nOur interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. This approach is based on the historically lower cost of borrowing at floating rates, and the historical correlation between interest rates and commodity prices. It does mean, however, that movements in market interest rates impact our earnings. In certain circumstances, we may elect to maintain a higher proportion of fixed-rate funding.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nBecause we aim to borrow and invest at floating interest rates, we enter into interest rate swaps and review these positions on a regular basis. During 2020, we entered into US$1.5 billion of interest rate swaps to convert the remaining fixed Alcan debt to floating interest rates. This is in accordance with our floating interest rate policy. We have put these swaps into fair value hedge relationships with the respective tranches of debt.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, US$5.9 billion (2019: US$4.5 billion) US dollar notional fixed-rate US dollar borrowings continue to be swapped to floating US dollar rates and \u20ac417 million (2019: \u20ac818 million) euro notional fixed-rate borrowings continue to be fully swapped to floating US dollar interest rates at an effective exchange rate of 1.3105. These swaps are in fair value hedge relationships.\n\nSince 2012, we have also held cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the principal and annual interest coupons of the Rio Tinto Finance plc \u00a3500m Sterling Bond to a US dollar notional with fixed US dollar annual interest coupons. We applied cash flow hedge accounting to this relationship to limit our US dollar cash flow exposure on the principal and interest payments. The hedge was fully effective in the 2020 and 2019 financial years as the notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates match.\n\n|                             |                                            |               |                          | 2020                                                                     | 2020                                                                           | 2019                                                                     | 2019                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Nominal amount  of the bond | Nominal amount  of the hedging  instrument | Maturity      | Effective  exchange rate | Gain in fair value of  the interest  component of the   hedged item US$m | Loss in fair value of  the interest  component of the  hedging instrument US$m | Loss in fair value of  the interest  component of the   hedged item US$m | Gain in fair value of  the interest  component of the  hedging instrument US$m |\n| \u00a3500 million                | US$807 million                             | November 2029 | 1.6132                   | 7                                                                        | (7)                                                                            | (24)                                                                     | 24                                                                             |\n\nIn 2019, we swapped the resulting fixed US dollar annual interest coupon payments to floating rates.

These are included within 'Other financial assets' and 'Other financial liabilities' in the balance sheet.\n\nThe main sources of ineffectiveness of the fair value hedges include changes in the timing of the cash flows of the hedging instrument compared to the underlying hedged item, and changes in the credit risk of parties to the hedging relationships. Refer to Note 8 for the changes in fair value of the bonds and the swaps as well as the ineffectiveness recognised in the period. Refer to Note 1 \"New standards Issued not yet effective\" for the impacts of IBOR reform.\n\nTaking into account the interest and currency interest rate swaps, at 31 December 2020, US$11.7 billion (2019: US$10.8 billion) of our adjusted gross borrowings were at floating rates. This has resulted in a floating to fixed debt ratio of 86% floating to 14% fixed (2019: 76% floating to 24% fixed). Our weighted average debt maturity was approximately 9 years (2019: 10 years) based on current interest rates and the carrying value of gross borrowings at the year end.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nBased on our floating rate financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2020, the effect on our net earnings of a 100 basis point increase in US dollar LIBOR interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an expense of US$7 million (2019: expense of US$20 million), reflecting the lower net debt position in 2020 compared to 2019. We have an exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders' equity arising from fair value movements on derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve. These derivatives have an underlying exposure to sterling and US dollars. With all factors remaining constant, and based on the composition of derivatives impacting the cash flow reserve at 31 December 2020, the sensitivity of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation would impact equity, before tax, by a charge of US$68 million (2019: US$68 million charge) for sterling and a credit of US$78 million (2019: US$78 million credit) for US dollars. A 100 basis point decrease would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.",

In 2020 and 2019, changing the level 3 inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly, taking into account the expected remaining term of contracts. The fair value of the long-term aluminium embedded derivatives is US$126 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: US$120 million).\n\nWe also have royalty receivables, with a carrying value of US$113 million (2019: US$124 million), arising from the sale of our coal assets in prior periods. These are classified as \"Other investments\", including loans within \"Other financial assets\". The fair values are determined using level 3 unobservable inputs.\n\nThe main unobservable input is the long-term coal price used over the life of the royalty receivable. A 15% increase in the coal spot price would result in a US$198 million increase (2019: US$214 million increase) in the carrying value. A 15% decrease in the coal spot price would result in a US$46 million decrease (2019: US$57 million decrease) in the carrying value. We have used a 15% assumption to calculate our exposure as it represents the annual coal price movement that we deem to be reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run).\n\n## 30 Contingencies and commitments\n\n|                                                                                      | 2020  US$m   | 2019 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Capital commitments excluding the Group's share of joint venture capital commitments |              |             |\n| Within 1 year                                                                        | 3,021        | 3,069       |\n| Between 1 and 3 years                                                                | 97           | 851         |\n| Between 3 and 5 years                                                                | -            | 133         |\n| After 5 years                                                                        | 34           | -           |\n| Total                                                                                | 3,152        | 4,053       |\n| Group's share of joint venture capital commitments                                   |              |             |\n| Within 1 year                                                                        | 9            | 92          |\n| Between 1 and 3 years                                                                | -            | 1           |\n| Total                                                                                | 9            | 93          |\n\nOur capital commitments include open purchase orders for managed operations and expenditure on major projects already authorised by our Investment Committee for non-managed operations.

The Group immediately sells the purchased products to third parties.\n\nAlong with the other joint venture partners, we have commitments to provide emergency funding (ie funding required to preserve the life or assets of the company or to comply with applicable laws) if required by Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., subject to approved thresholds.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, Minera Escondida Ltda held an undrawn shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio Tinto share) (31 December 2019: US$225 million).

However, purchase obligations exclude contracted purchases of bauxite, alumina and aluminium from joint arrangements and associates and contracted purchases of alumina from third parties.

        "page_content": "## Contingent liabilities\n\nIn October 2017, Rio Tinto announced that it had been notified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the SEC had filed a complaint in relation to Rio Tinto's disclosures and timing of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM). The impairment was reflected in Rio Tinto's 2012 year-end accounts. The SEC alleges that Rio Tinto, a former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and a former chief financial officer, Guy Elliott, committed violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities law by not accurately disclosing the value of RTCM and not impairing it when Rio Tinto published its 2011 year-end accounts in February 2012 or its 2012 interim results in August 2012. In June 2019, the trial court dismissed an associated US class action on behalf of securities holders. In August 2020, the appeals court partially overturned the court's dismissal and the case is with the trial court for further consideration.\n\nIn March 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) filed civil proceedings in the NSW District Registry of the Federal Court of Australia against Rio Tinto Limited, Albanese, and Elliott. On 1 May 2018, ASIC expanded its proceedings. ASIC alleges that Rio Tinto committed violations of the disclosure, accounting, and misleading or deceptive conduct provisions of the Corporations Act by making misleading or deceptive statements related to RTCM in its 2011 Annual Report and its 2012 interim financial statements, not complying with accounting standards in respect of its 2012 interim financial statements, and not disclosing an impairment of RTCM in its 2012 interim financial statements. ASIC further alleges Albanese and Elliott breached their duties as directors or officers, and failed to take all reasonable steps to comply with relevant accounting requirements.\n\nRio Tinto believes that the SEC case and the ASIC proceedings are unwarranted and will defend the allegations vigorously. Hence, no provisions have been recognised for these cases.\n\nRio Tinto continues to co-operate fully with relevant authorities in connection with their investigations in relation to contractual payments totalling US$10.5 million made to a consultant who had provided advisory services in 2011 on the Simandou project in Guinea. In August 2018, the court dismissed a related US class action commenced on behalf of securities holders. No provision has been recognised for this case.\n\nThe outcomes of these matters remain uncertain, but they could ultimately expose the Group to material financial cost. The Board is giving these matters its full and proper attention and a dedicated Board committee continues to monitor the progress of these matters, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group has not established provisions for certain additional legal claims in cases where we have assessed that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated.  A number of Group companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that could affect our business, financial position and reputation.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments may at times occur. The Group may incur, in the future, judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position.\n\n## Guarantees by parent companies\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the following securities issued by the following 100% owned finance subsidiaries: US$4.4 billion (31 December 2019: US$4.4 billion) Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited and Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds with maturity dates up to 2042; and US$1.2 billion (31 December 2019: US$1.6 billion) on the European Debt Issuance Programme. In addition, Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited have entered into facility arrangements for an aggregate amount of US$7.5 billion (31 December 2019: US$7.5 billion). The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. At 31 December 2020, US$4.3 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (2019: US$4.3 billion). Oyu Tolgoi LLC is jointly owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia, and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (66%, of which Rio Tinto owns 51%). The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.\n\nThe Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC's project finance debt servicing obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nThe Group has, from time to time, various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers.\n\n261",

North Mining Ltd (which is wholly owned by the Group) holds a 35% interest in Robe River. Through these companies the Group recognises a 65% share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Robe River, with a 12% non-controlling interest. The Group therefore has a 53% beneficial interest in Robe River.\n- (c) Alcan Alumina Ltda holds the Group's 10% interest in Cons\u00f3rcio De Alum\u00ednio Do Maranh\u00e3o, a joint operation in which the Group participates but is not a joint operator. The Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to this arrangement.\n- (d) Iron Ore Company of Canada is incorporated in the US, but operates in Canada.\n- (e) Diavik Diamond Mines (2012) Inc.

In accordance with the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement dated 8 June 2011, such funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable to them via a pledge over Erdenes' share of future OT common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making payments directly to Turquoise Hill. Common share investments funded on behalf of Erdenes, including accrued interest, are recorded as a reduction to the net carrying value of their component of non-controlling interests. As at 31 December 2020, the cumulative amount of such funding was US$1,378 million (31 December 2019: US$1,241 million), excluding accrued interest of US$804 million (31 December 2019: US$655 million) relating to this funding.\n\n264",

The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the parties; this dependence indicates that the parties in effect have obligations for the liabilities. It is these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification of these entities as joint operations.\n- (c) A number of arrangements are in place between the Australian Iron Ore operations managed by Rio Tinto which allow their respective assets to be operated as a single integrated network across the Pilbara region. The arrangements are managed through two wholly owned subsidiaries: Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd. In assessing the Pilbara Iron Arrangements, it has been concluded that they collectively constitute a joint operation on the basis that decisions about relevant activities require unanimous consent. The resulting efficiencies are shared between Rio Tinto and Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River), and the parties fund all of the cash flow requirements of Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd.\n- (d) Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc. has a 50.1% interest in the Aluminerie de B\u00e9cancour, Inc. aluminium smelter, which is located in Canada.\n\n265",

We treated this as an acquisition and accounted for our interest in ELYSIS using the equity method. We invested cash of US$5 million and contributed patents and licensed intellectual property (IP) to the venture. The patents and IP had no carrying value; however, on formation of the arrangement, they were recorded at fair value to reflect the contributions of the other parties in the joint venture. This value was US$171 million (US$141 million after tax).\n\n## Disposals\n\nWe have made no material disposals in 2020.\n\nOn 16 July 2019 we disposed of our entire 68.62% interest in R\u00f6ssing Uranium to China National Uranium Corporation Limited for gross cash proceeds of US$6.5 million. After adjusting for cash held on R\u00f6ssing's balance sheet at the date of disposal and included in the sale, we reported a net cash outflow of US$118 million and recognised a loss on disposal of US$289 million. This includes cumulative currency translation losses of US$212 million recycled from the currency translation reserve on sale of the business.\n\nOn 1 June 2018 we disposed of our entire 75% interest in the Winchester South coal development project in Queensland, Australia to Whitehaven Coal Limited for US$200 million. This comprised US$150 million cash which was received during 2018 and an unconditional cash payment of US$50 million which was subsequently received in June 2019. Both receipts were recognised within 'net cash generated from operating activities' within the cash flow statement. We recognised a gain on disposal of US$195 million within 'profit relating to interests in undeveloped projects' in the income statement.\n\nOn 1 August 2018 we completed the sale of our entire interest in the Hail Creek coal mine (82.0%) and the Valeria coal development project (71.2%) in Queensland, Australia to Glencore for a total consideration of US$1.7 billion.\n\nWe received net proceeds of US$1,545 million after completion adjustments in respect of the Hail Creek component of this transaction, resulting in a pre-tax gain of US$1,141 million. During 2019 we received a further US$26 million relating to working capital adjustments in respect of this sale. We also received cash proceeds in 2018 of US$170 million in respect of Valeria. Of this amount, US$87 million, relating to the sale of land and investments in associates, was included in investing cash flow, resulting in a pre-tax gain of US$18 million. The remaining US$83 million proceeds were recognised in operating cash flow, resulting in a pre-tax gain of US$83 million in 'profit relating to interests in undeveloped projects'.\n\n268\n\nAlso on 1 August 2018, we completed the sale of our entire interest in the Kestrel underground coal mine (80.0%) for US$2.25 billion to a consortium comprising EMR Capital (EMR) and PT Adaro Energy Tbk (Adaro). We received net cash proceeds of US$2,270 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of US$1,010 million.\n\nOn 14 December 2018 we completed the sale of the Dunkerque aluminium smelter in northern France to Liberty House for US$500 million, subject to final adjustments. In 2018 we received net cash proceeds of US$385 million. We recognised a pre-tax gain on disposal of US$128 million.\n\nOn 21 December 2018 we sold our interest in the Grasberg mine for US$3.5 billion as part of a series of transactions involving Inalum (PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero)) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Of the US$3.5 billion received, US$107 million related to our attributable share of copper and gold revenues for 2018, net of our capital contribution for the year. The remaining net proceeds of US$3,392 million were included in investing cash flows and gave rise to a gain on disposal of US$2,146 million.\n\nOn 1 September 2017, we disposed of our 100% shareholding in Coal & Allied Industries Limited to Yancoal Australia Limited for a total consideration of US$2.69 billion (before working capital adjustments). This comprised US$2.45 billion in cash paid on the closing date and a further US$240 million of unconditional guaranteed royalty payments. Total net cash proceeds received in 2017, net of working capital adjustments, transaction costs and cash transferred, were US$2.54 billion. This included receipt of US$110 million of the unconditional royalty payments. In 2018 we received a further US$90 million of unconditional royalty payments and in 2019 an additional US$20 million. We received US$10 million in 2020 and the final US$10 million was received in early 2021.",

These plans have been accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment'.\n\nThe charge that has been recognised in the income statement for Rio Tinto's share-based incentive plans, and the related liability (for cash-settled awards), is set out in the table below.\n\n|                       | Charge recognised for the year   | Charge recognised for the year   | Liability at the end of the year   | Liability at the end of the year   | Liability at the end of the year   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2020  US$m                       | 2019 US$m                        | 2018 US$m                          | 2020  US$m                         | 2019 US$m                          |\n| Equity-settled awards | 131                              | 118                              | 118                                | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Cash-settled awards   | 7                                | 5                                | 4                                  | 7                                  | 19                                 |\n| Total                 | 138                              | 123                              | 122                                | 7                                  | 19                                 |\n\nThe main Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans are as follows:\n\n## UK Share Plan (formerly the Share Ownership Plan)\n\nThe fair values of Matching and Free Shares made by Rio Tinto plc are taken to be the market value of the shares on the date of purchase. These awards are settled in equity.\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2018, shareholders approved the introduction of the Rio Tinto 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 'EIP'). From 2018, all long-term incentive awards have been granted under this umbrella plan which allows for awards in the form of Performance Share Awards (PSA), Management Share Awards (MSA) and Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) to be granted.\n\n## Performance Share Awards (Performance Share Plans prior to 2018)\n\nParticipants are generally assigned shares in settlement of their PSA on vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting.\n\nFor the parts of awards with Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions, the fair value of the awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the TSR performance conditions. One third of the awards granted up to 2017 (inclusive) are subject to an earnings margin performance target relative to ten global mining comparators. As this is a non-market related performance condition, under IFRS 2, the fair value recognised is reviewed at each accounting date based on the directors' expectations for the proportion vesting. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2019: 5% per annum).\n\nFor grants made from 2018, the earnings margin performance target applying to the PSA was removed and instead all of the awards are subject to the TSR performance conditions set out in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Management Share Awards (Management Share Plans prior to 2018)\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions being met; no performance conditions apply. In general, the awards will be settled in equity, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\nThe fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 7% per annum of outstanding awards (2019: 7% per annum).\n\n271",

In general, the awards will be settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 3% per annum of outstanding awards (2019: 3% per annum).\n\n## Global Employee Share Plans\n\nThe Global Employee Share Plans were introduced in 2012. Under these Plans, the companies provide a matching share award for each investment share purchased by a participant. The vesting of these matching awards is dependent on service conditions being met and the continued holding of investment shares by the participant until vesting. These awards are settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting. The fair value of each matching share on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the date of purchase less a deduction of 15% for cancellations (caused by employees electing to withdraw their investment shares before vesting of their matching shares). Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2019: 5% per annum).\n\nThe Management Share Awards, Performance Share Awards, Bonus Deferral Awards, Equity Incentive Plan, Global Employee Share Plans and UK Share Plan together represent 100% (2019: 100%) of the total IFRS 2 charge for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans in 2020.\n\n## Performance Share

Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and similar entities.\n\nDefined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks:\n\n| Uncertainty in benefit payments   | The value of the Group's liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will depend on the level of future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form of  inflation protection) and how long individuals live.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Volatility in asset values        | The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Uncertainty in cash funding       | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of cash funding,  although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries control over the rate of  cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee body or other body that is not  under the Group's direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation. |\n\nFor these reasons the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provisions and towards defined contribution arrangements instead. The defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are closed to new entrants in almost all countries. For unionised employees, some plans remain open.\n\nThe Group does not usually participate in multi-employer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group's participation in such plans is immaterial and consequently no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US and Switzerland.\n\nIn Canada the benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay and the plans are generally closed to new entrants. Benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically linked either to final average pay or to a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees join arrangements which are defined contribution from the Group's perspective, with any required additional funding being provided by employees. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to Canadian pension plans in the relevant provinces and territories (predominantly Quebec). Pension Committees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with the relevant regulations. The Pension Committees generally have a number of members appointed by the sponsor and a number appointed by the plan participants. In some cases there is also an independent Committee member.\n\nThe defined benefit sections of the UK arrangements are linked to final pay. New employees are admitted to defined contribution sections. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to UK pension plans. Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with UK regulations. The trustee board governing the main UK plans has a number of directors appointed by the sponsor, a number appointed by the plan participants and an independent trustee director.\n\nA number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US entities. Benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay. Benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees are admitted to defined contribution plans. A Benefits Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the plans are compliant with US regulations. Members of that Committee are appointed by the sponsor.\n\n274\n\nIn Europe, there are defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Germany and France. The largest single plan is in Switzerland, which provides benefits linked to final average pay. The Swiss plan is overseen by a foundation board which is responsible for ensuring that the plan complies with Swiss regulations. Foundation board members are appointed by the plan sponsor, by employees and by retirees.\n\nIn Australia, the main arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay, typically paid in lump sum form. These arrangements are managed by an independent financial institution. Rio Tinto may nominate candidates to be considered for appointment to the governing board, as may other employers. One third of the board positions are nominated by employers, with the remaining positions being filled by independent directors and directors nominated by participants.\n\nThe Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.\n\n## Post-retirement healthcare plans\n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants. Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These arrangements are generally unfunded, and are included in the figures below.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. Consequently, the funding level of the pension plans is affected by movements in the level of equity markets and also by movements in interest rates. The Group monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and equity markets and also measures its balance sheet pension risk using a value at risk approach. These measures are considered when deciding whether significant changes in investment strategy are required. Investment strategy reviews are conducted on a periodic basis for the main pension plans to determine the optimal investment mix bearing in mind the Group's tolerance for risk, the risk tolerance of the local sponsor companies and the views of the Pension Committees and trustee boards who are legally responsible for the investments of the plans. The assets of the pension plans may also be invested in Qualifying Insurance Policies which provide a stream of payments to match the benefits being paid out by the plans, thereby removing investment, inflation and longevity risks . In Canada, the UK and Switzerland, the Group works with the governing bodies to ensure that the investment policy adopted is consistent with the Group's tolerance for risk. In the US the Group has direct control over the investment policy, subject to local investment regulations.",

These managers may invest in the Group's securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group securities within the plans is US$4 million (2019: US$3 million).\n\nThe holdings of quoted equities are invested either in pooled funds or segregated accounts held in the name of the relevant pension funds. These equity portfolios are well diversified in terms of the geographic distribution and market sectors.\n\nThe holdings of government bonds are generally invested in the debt of the country in which a pension plan is situated. Corporate and other quoted bonds are usually of investment grade. Private debt is mainly held in the North American and UK pension funds and is invested in North American and European companies.\n\nThe property funds are invested in a diversified range of properties.\n\nThe holdings of cash & other are predominantly cash and short-term money market instruments.\n\nInvestments in private equity, private debt and property are less liquid than the other investment classes listed above and therefore the Group's investment in those asset classes is restricted to a level that does not endanger the liquidity of the pension plans.\n\nQualifying insurance policies are held with insurance companies that are regulated by the relevant local authorities. The value of those policies is calculated by the local actuaries using assumptions consistent with those adopted for valuing the insured obligations. The significant increase in the allocation to Qualifying insurance policies during 2020 results from an insurance transaction completed by one of the UK pension plans. The purchase price was financed predominantly from that plan's inflation-linked government bonds.\n\nThe Group makes limited use of futures, repurchase agreements and other instruments to manage the interest rate risk in some of its plans. Fund managers may also use derivatives to hedge currency movements within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently.\n\n## Maturity of defined benefit obligations\n\nAn approximate analysis of the maturity of the obligations is given in the table below:\n\n|                                                         | Pension benefits   | Other benefits   | 2020 Total   | 2019 Total   | 2018 Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Proportion relating to current employees                | 21 %               | 19 %             | 21 %         | 20 %         | 19 %         |\n| Proportion relating to former employees not yet retired | 12 %               | 0   %            | 11 %         | 12 %         | 11 %         |\n| Proportion relating to retirees                         | 67 %               | 81 %             | 68 %         | 68 %         | 70 %         |\n| Total                                                   | 100 %              | 100 %            | 100 %        | 100 %        | 100 %        |\n| Average duration of obligations (years)                 | 14.4               | 13.5             | 14.3         | 14.4         | 13.4         |\n\n## Geographical distribution of defined benefit obligations\n\nAn approximate analysis of the geographic distribution of the obligations is given in the table below:\n\n|             | Pension benefits   | Other benefits   | 2020 Total   | 2019 Total   | 2018 Total   |\n|-------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Canada      | 54 %               | 46 %             | 53 %         | 53 %         | 48 %         |\n| UK          | 30 %               | 2   %            | 28 %         | 28 %         | 28 %         |\n| US          | 7   %              | 50 %             | 10 %         | 10 %         | 14 %         |\n| Switzerland | 5   %              | 0   %            | 5   %        | 5   %        | 5   %        |\n| Other       | 4   %              | 2   %            | 4   %        | 4   %        | 5   %        |\n| Total       | 100 %              | 100 %            | 100 %        | 100 %        | 100 %        |\n\n275",

        "page_content": "## Funding policy and contributions to plans\n\nThe Group reviews the funding position of its major pension plans on a regular basis and considers whether to provide funding above the minimum level required in each country. In Canada and the US the minimum level is prescribed by legislation. In the UK and Switzerland the minimum level is negotiated with the local trustee or foundation in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to provide funding above the minimum level the Group takes into account other possible uses of cash within the Group, the tax situation of the local sponsoring entity and any strategic advantage that the Group might obtain by accelerating contributions. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.\n\n|                                             |   Pension benefits US$m |   Other benefits US$m |   2020 Total US$m |   2019 Total US$m |   2018 Total US$m |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Contributions to defined benefit plans      |                     169 |                    32 |               201 |               257 |               248 |\n| Contributions to defined contribution plans |                     259 |                     2 |               261 |               235 |               244 |\n| Total                                       |                     428 |                    34 |               462 |               492 |               492 |\n\nThe level of surplus in the Rio Tinto Pension Fund in the UK is such that it may be used to pay for the employer contributions to the defined contribution section of that Fund, in accordance with the funding arrangements agreed with the Trustee of that Fund. Consequently, the cash paid to defined contribution plans is lower than the defined contribution service cost by US$3 million. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans are kept under regular review and actual contributions will be determined in line with the Group's wider financing strategy, taking into account relevant minimum funding requirements. As contributions to many plans are reviewed on at least an annual basis, the contributions for 2021 and subsequent years cannot be determined precisely in advance. Most of the Group's largest pension funds are fully funded on their local funding basis and do not require long-term funding commitments at present. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2021 are estimated to be around US$150 million but may be higher or lower than this depending on the evolution of financial markets and voluntary funding decisions taken by the Group. Contributions for subsequent years are expected to be at similar levels. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments net of participant contributions. The Group's contributions in 2021 are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2020.\n\n## Movements in the net defined benefit liability\n\nA summary of the movement in the net defined benefit liability is shown in the first table below. The subsequent tables provide a more detailed analysis of the movements in the present value of the obligations and the fair value of assets.\n\n|                                                                                  | Pension benefits US$m   | Other benefits US$m   | 2020 Total US$m   | 2019 Total US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Change in the net defined benefit liability                                      |                         |                       |                   |                   |\n| Net defined benefit liability at the start of the year                           | (831)                   | (899)                 | (1,730)           | (1,551)           |\n| Amounts recognised in income statement                                           | (172)                   | (33)                  | (205)             | (146)             |\n| Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income                                 | (416)                   | (58)                  | (474)             | (262)             |\n| Employer contributions                                                           | 169                     | 32                    | 201               | 257               |\n| Arrangements added/divested                                                      | -                       | -                     | -                 | (5)               |\n| Assets transferred to defined contribution section                               | (3)                     | -                     | (3)               | (3)               |\n| Currency exchange rate (loss)                                                    | (52)                    | (10)                  | (62)              | (20)              |\n| Net defined benefit liability at the end of the year                             | (1,305)                 | (968)                 | (2,273)           | (1,730)           |\n|                                                                                  | Pension benefits        | Other benefits        | 2020              | 2019              |\n|                                                                                  |                         |                       | Total             | Total             |\n|                                                                                  | US$m                    | US$m                  | US$m              | US$m              |\n| Change in present value of obligation                                            |                         |                       |                   |                   |\n| Present value of obligation at the start of the year                             | (14,754)                | (899)                 | (15,653)          | (14,754)          |\n| Current employer service costs                                                   | (131)                   | (6)                   | (137)             | (125)             |\n| Past service cost                                                                | (2)                     | -                     | (2)               | -                 |\n| Settlements                                                                      | 6                       | -                     | 6                 | 638               |\n| Interest on obligation                                                           | (357)                   | (27)                  | (384)             | (476)             |\n| Contributions by plan participants                                               | (22)                    | -                     | (22)              | (23)              |\n| Benefits paid                                                                    | 746                     | 32                    | 778               | 862               |\n| Experience gains                                                                 | 46                      | 15                    | 61                | 111               |\n| Changes in financial assumptions (loss)                                          | (1,357)                 | (85)                  | (1,442)           | (1,447)           |\n| Changes in demographic assumptions gain                                          | 127                     | 12                    | 139               | 41                |\n| Arrangements (added)                                                             | -                       | -                     | -                 | (5)               |\n| Currency exchange rate (loss) Present value of obligation at the end of the year | (512)    (16,210)       | (10)  (968)           | (522)  (17,178)   | (475)  (15,653)   |\n\n277",

Obligations were also settled through a lump sum window exercise being offered to members with a deferred pension in the US.\n\nThe asset ceiling had no effect during the year. In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each country and the rules specific to each pension plan. The calculation takes into account any minimum funding requirements that may be applicable to the plan, whether any reduction in future Group contributions is available, and whether a refund of surplus may be available. In considering whether any refund of surplus is available the Group considers the powers of trustee boards and similar bodies to augment benefits or wind up a plan. Where such powers are unilateral, the Group does not consider a refund to be available at the end of the life of a plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus, the asset ceiling may have no effect, although it may be the case that a refund will only be available many years in the future.\n\n## Main assumptions (rates per annum)\n\nThe main assumptions for the valuations of the plans under IAS 19 are set out below. Where there are multiple plans in a country the rates below are weighted-average figures .\n\n|                              | Canada   | UK   | US   | Switzerland   |\n|------------------------------|----------|------|------|---------------|\n| At 31 December 2020          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 2.5%     | 1.2% | 2.2% | 0.1%          |\n| Inflation (a)                | 1.6%     | 2.9% | 2.1% | 0.9%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.1%     | 2.5% | -%   | 0.5%          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries | 2.8%     | 3.6% | 3.6% | 1.9%          |\n| At 31 December 2019          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 3.1%     | 2.0% | 3.1% | 0.2%          |\n| Inflation (a)                | 1.6%     | 2.9% | 2.0% | 1.1%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.1%     | 2.5% | -%   | 0.2%          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries | 2.8%     | 3.5% | 3.5% | 2.1%          |\n\nThe main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 2.5% (2019: 3.3%); medical trend rate: 6.3% reducing to 4.6% by the year 2031 broadly on a straight line basis (2019: 6.1%, reducing to 4.6% by the year 2029); claims costs based on individual company experience.\n\nFor both the pension and healthcare arrangements the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity. The mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years (2019: 27 years) and that a man aged 60 in 2040 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 28 years (2019: 28 years).The mortality tables are generally based upon the latest standard tables published in each country, adjusted appropriately to reflect the actual mortality experience of the plan participants where credible data is available..\n\n278",

In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions, we calculate what the obligations would be if we were to make changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure and the figure calculated using our stated assumptions is an indication of the sensitivity to changes in each assumption. The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small changes in the assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the assumptions. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on pension increases, which are generally linked to inflation where they are granted.\n\n|                                                               |                                                                                           | 2020 Approximate   | 2020 Approximate   | 2019 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations   | 2019 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assumption                                                    | Change in assumption                                                                      | Pensions US$m      | Other US$m         | Pensions US$m                                          | Other US$m                                             |\n| Discount rate                                                 | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 988                | 62                 | 894                                                    | 56                                                     |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (1,186)            | (66)               | (1,057)                                                | (60)                                                   |\n| Inflation                                                     | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (484)              | (19)               | (447)                                                  | (17)                                                   |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 450                | 17                 | 422                                                    | 15                                                     |\n| Salary increases                                              | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (81)               | (1)                | (55)                                                   | (1)                                                    |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 72                 | 1                  | 54                                                     | 1                                                      |\n| Demographic - allowance for future improvements in  longevity | Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of  individuals who are one year older   | 520                | 19                 | 443                                                    | 18                                                     |\n|                                                               | Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of  individuals who are one year younger | (562)              | (19)               | (465)                                                  | (18)                                                   |\n\n279",

Related undertakings include 'subsidiaries', 'associated undertakings', and 'significant holdings in undertakings other than subsidiary companies'. The registered office address, country of incorporation, classes of shares and the effective percentage of equity owned by the Group calculated by reference to voting rights, is disclosed as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe definition of a subsidiary undertaking in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 is different from the definition under IFRS.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial Statements Notes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial Statements\n\n## A Principal accounting policies\n\n## a. Basis of preparation\n\nThe Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 and FRS 101. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:\n\n- - Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment' (details of the number and weighted average exercise prices of share options and how the fair value of goods and services received was determined).\n- - Paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement' (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities).\n- - IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'.\n- - Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', comparative information requirements in respect of Paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- - The following paragraphs of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- - 10 (d) (statement of cash flows);\n- - 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n- - 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n- - 38B-D (additional comparative information);\n- - 111 (cash flow statement information); and\n- - 134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- - IAS 7 'Statement of cash flows'.\n- - Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued and is not yet effective).\n- - Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 'Related party disclosures' (key management compensation).\n- - The requirements of IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group.\n\n## b. Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates and to use judgment in applying accounting policies and making critical accounting estimates. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements.\n\nThe key area of judgment that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for impairment of investment carrying values.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.  The unit of account being the equity of the subsidiary taken as a whole, which may comprise interests in multiple cash-generating units.\n\nIf any such indication exists, Rio Tinto plc makes an assessment of the recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss will be recorded and the asset written down based on the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the higher of\n\nfair value less cost of disposal and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## c. Currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nExchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements (note 40).\n\n## d. Investments\n\nInvestments in Group companies are valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## e. Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## f. Share-based payments\n\nThe Company operates a number of share-based payment plans for Group employees, the details of which are included in the consolidated financial statements (note 41). The fair value of the Company's share plans is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected vesting period, with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. Payments received from the Company's subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments are recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. The Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market-based vesting conditions attached to the award.\n\nNon-market based vesting conditions (eg relative EBIT margin performance targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.\n\n## g. Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## h. Treasury shares\n\nThe consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders' funds through retained earnings.\n\n303",

In addition, these entities also jointly guarantee the Group's undrawn credit facility which was US$7.5 billion at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: US$7.5 billion). Rio Tinto plc has provided guarantees in respect of certain derivative contracts that are in a liability position of US$141 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: US$290 million).\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. At 31 December 2020, US$4.3 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (31 December 2019: US$4.3 billion). Oyu Tolgoi LLC is owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia, and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (66%, of which Rio Tinto owns 51%). The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.\n\nThe Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC's project finance debt servicing obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\nDuring 2020, fees of US$108 million (2019: US$157 million) were received from Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd as consideration for the provision of the CSU.\n\n304",

For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including definitions and calculations, please refer to pages 329-333.\n\n- (a) Gross product sales includes the sales revenue of equity accounted units on a proportionately consolidated basis (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) in addition to consolidated sales. Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales to equity accounted units which are not included in gross product sales.\n- (b) Underlying EBITDA of subsidiaries and the Group's share relating to equity accounted units represents earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto before: tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation charged to the income statement in the period and excludes the EBITDA impact of the same items that are excluded from underlying earnings as defined in note 2.\n- (c) Represents profit after tax for the period attributable to the owners of the Rio Tinto Group. Business unit earnings are stated before finance items but after the amortisation of discount related to provisions. Earnings attributed to business units do not include amounts that are excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.\n- (d) Pilbara represents the Group's 100% holding in Hamersley, 50% holding in Hope Downs Joint Venture and 65% holding in Robe River Iron Associates. The Group's net beneficial interest in Robe River Iron Associates is 53%, as 30% is held through a 60% owned subsidiary and 35% is held through a 100% owned subsidiary.\n- (e) Gross product sales, Underlying EBITDA, Net Earnings and Operating assets within Evaluation projects/other include activities relating to the shipment and blending of Pilbara and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) iron ore inventories held at  portside in China and sold to domestic customers.  Transactions between the Pilbara and our portside trading business are eliminated through the Iron Ore \"intrasegment\" line and transactions between IOC and the portside trading business are eliminated through \"inter-segment transactions\".\n- (f) In order to reflect the evolution of the Aluminium business, the following changes have been implemented:\n- -The consolidation line for Bauxite & Alumina has been removed to reflect the less integrated nature of the business and the evolution of the Bauxite business towards a primarily export oriented operation. As a result of this change, the intra-group segment elimination for Gross product sales, Underlying EBITDA, Net Earnings and Operating assets between bauxite and alumina are now reported on line \"Intra-segment and other\". The intra-segment eliminations for the year ended 31 December 2020 would have been US$722 million, US$31 million, US$21 million and US$7 million respectively. For the year ended 31 December 2019 the eliminations were US$825 million, US$10 million, US$7 million and US$27 million. For the year ended 31 December 2018 the eliminations were US$861 million, US$7 million, US$5 million and US$20 million.\n- -The Underlying EBITDA and Net Earnings have been restated to include the impact of the legacy alumina contracts (2019: US$218 million and US$171 million, respectively; 2018: US$457 million and US$355 million, respectively) in the Alumina business instead of being included in the Other product group items line, in order to provide a comprehensive view of the performance of the Alumina business.\n\n- -The Gross product sales, Underlying EBITDA and Net Earnings have been restated to reallocate the margin generated by internal shipping activities to Bauxite (2019: US$31 million, US$76 million and US$57 million, respectively; 2018: US$40 million, US$62 million and US$54 million, respectively) and Alumina businesses (2019: US$63 million, US$157 million and US$117 million, respectively; 2018: US$83 million, US$128 million and US$111 million, respectively), instead of being included in the Evaluation project/other line in order to provide a comprehensive view of the performance of the Bauxite and Alumina businesses.\n\nGross product sales, Underlying EBITDA, Net Earnings and Operating assets of the overall Rio Tinto Aluminium business were not impacted by these changes.\n\n- (g) In 2018, Aluminium capital expenditure was reported net of US$508 million proceeds received from the sale of surplus land at Kitimat. These proceeds were not included in Aluminium's free cash flow and the associated gain was excluded from business unit earnings and Underlying EBITDA.\n- (h) Through a joint venture agreement with Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (Freeport), we were entitled to 40% of material mined above an agreed threshold as a consequence of expansions and developments of the Grasberg facilities since 1998 (until 21 December 2018). On 21 December 2018, we sold our entire interest in the Grasberg mine to PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (Inalum).\n- (i) Our interest in Oyu Tolgoi is held indirectly through our 50.8% investment in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ), where TRQ's principal asset is its 66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owns the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine.\n- (j) Includes our interests in Argyle (100%) and Diavik (60%).\n- (k) Includes our 82% interest in the Hail Creek coal mine (until 1 August 2018), our 80% interest in the Kestrel underground coal mine (until 1 August 2018) and interests in the Winchester South (until 1 June 2018) and Valeria development projects (until 1 August 2018).\n\nOn 1 June 2018, we sold our entire 75% interest in the Winchester South coal development project in Queensland, Australia, to Whitehaven Coal Limited for US$200 million.\n\nOn 1 August 2018, we sold our entire 82% interest in the Hail Creek coal mine and 71.2% interest in the Valeria coal development project in Queensland, Australia, to Glencore for US$1.7 billion.\n\nOn 1 August 2018, we sold our entire 80% interest in the Kestrel underground coal mine in Queensland, Australia, to a consortium comprising private equity manager EMR Capital (EMR) and PT Adaro Energy Tbk (Adaro), an Indonesian listed coal company, for US$2.25 billion.\n\nRio Tinto Coal Australia's operating assets of US$(837) million at 31 December 2018 included provisions for onerous contracts in relation to rail infrastructure capacity and capital gains tax payable on the divestments announced in the year, partly offset by financial assets and receivables relating to contingent royalties and disposal proceeds. Following a change in management responsibility in 2019, these amounts are reported within \"Other operations\" at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, with no restatement of the 31 December 2018 comparative amount.\n\n- (l) Includes our interests in Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (100%), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM, 80%) and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74%).",

In February 2020, our interest in ERA increased from 68.4% to 86.3% as a result of new ERA shares issued to Rio Tinto under the Entitlement Offer and Underwriting Agreement to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area.\n- (n) Simfer Jersey Limited, in which the Group has a 53% interest, has an 85% interest in Simfer S.A., the company that manages the Simandou project in Guinea. The Group therefore has a 45.05% indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities are consolidated as subsidiaries and together referred to as the Simandou iron ore project.\n- (o) Other operations include our 100% interest in the Gove alumina refinery, Rio Tinto Marine and, with effect from the first half of 2019, the remaining operating assets of Rio Tinto Coal Australia. As at 31 December 2020, these include provisions for onerous contracts in relation to rail infrastructure capacity, partly offset by deferred tax assets and financial assets and receivables relating to contingent royalties and disposal proceeds. Refer to note (k).\n- (p) Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets. The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries' capital expenditure and Rio Tinto's share of the capital expenditure of joint operations and equity accounted units.\n- (q) Operating assets of subsidiaries is comprised of net assets excluding post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax, and before deducting net debt. Operating assets are stated after the deduction of noncontrolling interests - these are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies (ie inclusive of such companies' debt and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).\n- (r) Assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2018 included our interest in R\u00f6ssing Uranium Limited, the ISAL smelter, the Aluchemie anode plant, and the Alufluor aluminium fluoride plant.\n\n309",

The order essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the Group's dual listed companies (DLC) structure in 1995. The order applies to Rio Tinto Limited's financial reporting obligations for the financial years and half-years ending between 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2023 inclusive.\n\nIn essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to prepare consolidated financial statements covering only itself and its controlled entities, the order allows Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity. In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared:\n\n- - in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS) rather than the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report), and in accordance with UK financial reporting obligations generally;\n- - on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial Reporting Standard 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, should be applied using the combined financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which the DLC Merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was accounted for using 'merger', rather than 'acquisition', accounting (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other; and meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC Merger were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation);\n- - on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single company (with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company); and\n- - with a reconciliation, from EU IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts: consolidated loss/profit for the financial year, total consolidated comprehensive loss/income for the financial year and total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year (see page 205).\n\n310\n\nThose consolidated financial statements must also be audited in relation to their compliance with relevant Australian and UK requirements. Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors' Report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations Act (applied on the basis that for these purposes the consolidated entity is the Group, and the consolidated financial statements cover the Group). This includes a Remuneration Report (see pages 140-185) prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act (including timing requirements) in relation to those consolidated financial statements (including any concise financial statements), the Auditors' report and the Directors' Report. The Corporations Act also requires that a non-binding resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report be voted on by shareholders at Rio Tinto Limited's annual general meeting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto Limited is also not required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year.\n\nRio Tinto Limited must, however, in accordance with the Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a note, various parent entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited (including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and contractual commitments) prepared in accordance with AAS (see page 280).",

We considered which benchmarks and Key Performance Indicators have the greatest bearing on shareholder decisions.\n\nWe determined that Profit Before Tax for continuing operations, is the key measure for performance of the Group. As such, we based our materiality on Profit Before Tax for continuing  operations excluding certain identified  items which could significantly distort results in any one particular year, of which $550m represents 3.3%.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                        |   Item |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment in specific cash generating units |    3.1 |\n| Evaluation of provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations                                                                     |    3.2 |\n| Evaluation of provisions for uncertain tax positions                                                                                                   |    3.3 |\n| Recoverability of Rio Tinto Plc's investments in its subsidiaries                                                                                      |    3.4 |\n\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee (AC) met six times. KPMG is invited to attend all Audit Committee meetings and is invited  to meet with the AC in private sessions without Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications  with the Audit Committee in Section 3, including  matters that required particular judgment.\n\nThe matters included  in the Audit Committee  Chair's report on page 133 are consistent with our observations of those meetings. Our audit opinions and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reports to the Rio Tinto Audit Committee.\n\nWe have fulfilled  our ethical  responsibilities  under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including  the FRC Ethical Standard as applied  to listed public interest entities; the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order; and the relevant ethical requirements of the Australian Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards).\n\nWe have not provided any services which are prohibited  by the standards noted  above to the Group during the year ended 31 December 2020 (FY20) or subsequently.\n\nWe were first appointed  as auditor in May 2020 by the shareholders following votes at the Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited  annual general meetings, this being our first year of engagement.\n\n| Total audit fee                                  | $17.3m         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Total non-audit fees                             | $2.3m          |\n| Non-audit  fee as a % of  audit fee %            | 13.3%          |\n| Next financial period  which requires a tender   | 31             |\n|                                                  | December  2030 |\n| Tenure of Group signing  and component  partners | 1 year         |\n\n## Materiality levels used in our audit\n\n| \uf0a2      | Group  Group Materiality        |\n|--------|---------------------------------|\n| \uf0a2  PCM | Parent Company Materiality      |\n| \uf0a2  GPM | Group Performance Materiality   |\n| \uf0a2  HCM | Highest Component Materiality   |\n| \uf0a2  LCM | Lowest Component Materiality    |\n| \uf0a2  RDT | Reporting Differences Threshold |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We scoped:\n\n- \uf0a7 2 components,  the Pilbara and Oyu Tolgoi as individually financially significant components which were subject to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \uf0a7 12 further components subject to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \uf0a7 8 components subject to audit of account balances associated to significant  or elevated risks on either provision for closedown, restoration and environmental obligations or asset valuations; and\n- \uf0a7 15 further components subject to audit of account balances to ensure sufficient  audit coverage.\n\nWe also considered the extent to which Rio Tinto operates shared service centres for its transaction processing. In particular, across sales and purchase processes, transactions that originate in one country may be processed in Singapore and Delhi. As a result, we established  teams in Singapore and Delhi. The extent  of testing of controls in these locations is specific to the nature of transactions processed. We performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, set out in more detail in Section 7 below.\n\nIn addition,  we performed Group level analysis on the remaining components  to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audits, as agreed with the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements. Unlike other major resources companies, the Group does not mine or extract hydrocarbons such as coal, natural gas or oil but it does emit greenhouse gases directly from energy used in its mining operations, the processing of metals and minerals, and the transportation of its products. The Group's products are used in energy and carbon intensive industries including steel or aluminium production. The Group has set out its targets under the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon intensity by 30% and absolute  emissions by 15% by 2030, and to be net carbon neutral by 2050 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Further information is provided in the Strategic Report on pages 79 to 85 and the Group's Climate Change report.\n\nClimate change initiatives and commitments  impact the preparation of the Group's financial statements  in a variety of ways, all with inherent uncertainties. As explained in note 1 of the financial statements, the Group has considered certain commodity and carbon pricing scenarios in assessing the impact of climate change in preparing its financial statements. For the Group, other judgments and estimates are also expected to include  the setting of useful economic lives for carbon intensive property and equipment  (such as aluminium  smelting or coal fired power plants), the valuation of assets or the determination of impairment charges taking into account future pricing assumptions and estimates of mine life and closure and rehabilitation costs. Climate change also impacts the long-term viability of aspects of the mining industry especially given greenhouse gas intensity in the use of certain of the industry's products (measured under Scope 3 emissions).\n\nHowever, whilst the Group has set targets to be carbon neutral by 2050, the consequences, in terms of investment, its cost base and impact on cash flows are still being assessed as the Group considers how it will work towards meeting these targets. To the extent  there are known implications  these have been reflected in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requirements and have been considered in our audit as set out in our key audit matters. It is therefore likely that the future carrying amounts of assets or liabilities  will change for these other judgments and estimates as the Group responds to its climate change targets.\n\nOur Key Audit Matters explain how we have assessed the Group's climate related assumptions and relevant disclosures in arriving at our audit conclusions.  This includes the use of our own climate change and sustainability specialists. We have also read the Group's disclosure of climate related information in the front half of the annual report and compared this to our knowledge gained from our financial statement audit work.\n\nThe Group's disclosures in the financial statements of the potential impacts of climate change and the assumptions used in setting  key estimates and judgments  has increased significantly this year. We have discussed with the Group ways in which  climate change disclosures should continue to evolve as the Group continues to evaluate pathways to being net carbon neutral.",

KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including  those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \uf0a7 the overall audit strategy;\n- \uf0a7 the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \uf0a7 directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance, together with our principal  audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for EU public  interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed in the context  of, and our results are based on, procedures undertaken for the purpose of our audit of the financial  statements as a whole and in forming our opinions  thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters.\n\n## 3.1 Evaluation  of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment in specific cash generating units\n\n## Financial  Statement Elements\n\n## Cash Generating Units\n\nOyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine Yarwun alumina refinery Kitimat aluminium smelter\n\n## Description  of the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the Group's assets are affected by forward-looking assumptions  and estimation uncertainties. Specific to this year, these include the effects of macroeconomic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted pricing of some of the Group's products, and, longer term, the impacts of climate  change which affect forward looking assumptions such as commodity pricing.\n\n## Assessment of impairment  indicators\n\nThe Group's determination of whether an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists is judgmental and includes consideration of external factors such as changes in commodity  prices as well as internal factors such as changes to estimated future operating or capital  costs.\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, Yarwun alumina refinery and Kitimat aluminium  smelter cash generating units (CGUs), have previously been impaired. We assessed these CGUs as most at risk of additional  impairment or impairment reversal and as the subject of this key audit matter. For Oyu Tolgoi this included  an assessment of the finalisation of the Definitive Estimate in December 2020. The Group did not identify indicators of impairment or impairment reversal in respect of these CGUs.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Control operation\n\nTesting the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over assessment of impairment indicators.\n\n## Tests of detail\n\nIn respect of the CGUs noted, we challenged the Group's assessment of potential indicators of impairment or impairment reversal, through;\n\n- \uf0a7 comparing operational and financial performance in the period to approved budgets;\n- \uf0a7 assessing changes in external market conditions that could impact operating costs; and\n- \uf0a7 comparing forecast commodity prices used in the Group's assessment to market consensus forecasts.\n\nIn addition  to the above, our work in relation to the Oyu Tolgoi CGU  included:\n\n- \uf0a7 understanding the impact of the Definitive Estimate on mine plan assumptions, including remaining capital expenditure costs and date of first production,  to assess if the Definitive Estimate represented an indicator  of impairment or impairment reversal; and\n- \uf0a7 understanding the status of discussions, with the Government of Mongolia, to assess the basis for management's conclusion that this is not an impairment indicator.\n\n## Our results\n\nFY20: Acceptable",

As part of our risk assessment we satisfied ourselves that events or conditions  had caused these assets to have negligible value and therefore limited estimation uncertainty.\n\n- >> Refer to notes 1(i) and 6, and the Audit Committee's views set out on page 133.\n\n## Communications  with Rio Tinto's Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf0a7 How the outcome of the Definitive Estimate for Oyu Tolgoi compared to the scenarios considered  as part of the 2019 impairment test.\n- \uf0a7 How the current status of discussions with the Government of Mongolia compare to the risks anticipated at the time of the 2019 impairment test.\n- \uf0a7 How the Group considered the impacts of climate change within its assessment of potential  indicators of impairment or impairment reversal, and, as explained in note 1 to the financial statements, that the financial statements do not yet reflect the financial reporting consequences of how the Group will meet its target to be carbon net neutral by 2050.\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the Group's conclusion that there are no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, Yarwun alumina refinery and Kitimat aluminium  smelter cash generating units (CGUs) and related disclosures to be acceptable.\n\n## 3.2 Evaluation  of provisions  for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations\n\n## Financial  Statement Elements\n\n## Our results\n\nClosure Provision carrying value\n\n$13,335m at 31 December 2020\n\n## Description  of the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nThe Group incurs legal and constructive obligations for close-down  and restoration activities  which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. Generally, there is relatively limited activity within the Group or broader industry of completing  large scale restoration and rehabilitation projects, and elements of restoration and rehabilitation  of each site are relatively unique to the site.  As such, there are limited comparable historical precedents against which to benchmark estimates of future costs, which  increases estimation uncertainty.\n\nA significant  proportion of the Group's assets have long remaining lives, which also increases the estimation uncertainty relating to the rehabilitation activities required, including  considering the impact of future environmental requirements and climate change, and the timing and amount of the associated future cash flows. Because of this, the effect of the time value of money is material.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Control operation\n\nTesting internal controls over the Group's process to estimate provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations, including controls over the Groups selection of the assumptions, data, methods and models to be used. This included controls over the determination of key inputs such as future rehabilitation costs, the timing of these costs, the life of the operation or site, the discount rate and the preparation of the underlying closure plan scenarios.\n\n## Tests of detail\n\nFor Pilbara, Kennecott  and Gove refinery closure provisions as at 31 December 2020, we performed the following  procedures:\n\n- \uf0a7 we performed a retrospective review of the key cost assumptions  to evaluate the accuracy of the Group's forecasting;\n- \uf0a7 we examined  the most recent closure studies  and other technical  material prepared by the Group relating to changes in the closure provision to assess the nature and scope of work undertaken. We compared estimated closure costs included in the studies with those used in the calculation  of the provision;\n- \uf0a7 for operations that the Group determined did not require a change in key assumptions during the year, we considered the consistency of the Group's conclusion  with our understanding of the obligations associated with that operation and its closure remediation plan;\n\nFY20: Acceptable\n\n## Impact of climate change\n\nWe used our sustainability specialists to assist in understanding the Group's approach to incorporating the impacts of climate change into its pricing process. We used this information to challenge how the Group's analysis of indicators of impairment took factors such as the impact of climate change on commodity pricing into account.\n\n## Assessing disclosures\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in notes 1 and 6 of the financial statements against the accounting requirements.",

These vary across location, product  and operation.\n\nThe Group has disclosed that the determination of when an estimate associated with close-down, restoration and environmental obligations is sufficiently  reliable to update is an area of judgment that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nThe evaluation of provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations  is a key audit matter due to the amount of the provision and the judgment and specialised skills involved in auditing the key inputs used by the Group to determine the provision including:\n\n- \uf0a7 the nature and timing of future close-down and restoration activities including post-closure monitoring and associated costs;\n- \uf0a7 the life of the operation and timing of commencement  of rehabilitation  activities;\n- \uf0a7 the interpretation of legislative requirements; and\n- \uf0a7 the discount rate.\n\nIn 2020 the Group reduced the discount  rate used to value future closure obligations  which  resulted in an increase to the close-down, restoration and environmental provisions of $954 million.\n\nWe focussed on the locations most material and sensitive to changes in key inputs being:\n\n- \uf0a7 Rio Tinto  Iron Ore (Pilbara)\n- \uf0a7 Rio Tinto Kennecott\n- \uf0a7 Gove refinery\n\n>> Refer to notes 1(l) and 25, and the Audit Committee's views set out on page 133.\n\n## Communications  with Rio Tinto's Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf0a7 Our support for additional  disclosures provided by management in addition  to those in FY19, given the size of the company's closure obligations  and the degree of estimation uncertainty and judgment in applying the relevant accounting principles to such long-lived commitments.\n\n## Areas of particular  auditor judgment\n\n- \uf0a7 Having found the discount  rate (1.5%) to be toward the upper end of the range we considered to be acceptable, we exercised judgment  to determine the acceptability  of the closure provision balance given the discount  rate used, taking into  account  our assessment of the associated cash flows and the clarity of the associated  disclosure of the sensitivity and impact of the closure provision to changes in the discount rate.\n\nBased on the risk identified  and our procedures performed, we consider that the level of provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations and related disclosures to be acceptable.\n\n- \uf0a7 we assessed the sensitivity of closure provision calculations to changes in key assumptions, and considered the reasonableness of the assumptions with the greatest impact on the assessment for each site by comparing them to independent  sources of data or considering  the approach undertaken by the Group to determine them where external comparable data was not available; and\n- \uf0a7 We assessed an immaterial audit misstatement identified  in the context  of the overall balance and the financial statements  as a whole.\n\n## Our closure and valuation expertise\n\nFor Pilbara and the Gove refinery we used our closure specialists to assist us in assessing:\n\n- \uf0a7 the scope, competency  and objectivity  of the Group's experts, both internal and external to the Group, who produce the cost estimates;\n- \uf0a7 the reasonableness of key assumptions made by the Group for closure activities included in the closure scenarios by comparing them against our understanding of the legislative requirements, the Group's closure\n\ncommitments, industry practice and our understanding of the business;\n\n- \uf0a7 the Group's assumptions  regarding the timing and costs of such activities based on their experience and familiarity with applicable regulations and the forecast life of the operation; and\n- \uf0a7 the consistency of closure activities reflected in the Group's models used to determine the provision with the relevant closure plan.\n\nWe used our valuations specialists  to assist us in evaluating the discount  rate applied by the Group to calculate the net present value of these provisions by evaluating it against external data including yields on long-term government bonds and external market research, using our specialist knowledge. .\n\n## Assessing disclosures\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in notes 1 and 25 of the financial statements against the accounting requirements.",

GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (KPMG UK ONLY)\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial  statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Company or the Group or to cease their operations, and they have concluded  that the Company's and the Group's financial position  means that this is realistic. They have also concluded  that there are no material uncertainties  that could  have cast significant  doubt over their ability  to continue  as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going Concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks we consider as most relevant to the level of the Group's financial resources over this period relate to levels of demand and commodity pricing.\n\nWe critically assessed the assumptions in the Directors' downside  scenarios relevant to liquidity  and covenant metrics, in particular in relation to revenue growth by comparing to historical trends and assessing whether downside scenarios applied take into account reasonably possible downsides. The extent of our work was influenced by the level of liquidity.\n\nWe assessed the completeness  of the going concern disclosure.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\nWe consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Group's and Company's financial statements is appropriate.\n\nWe have not identified,  and concur with  the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually  or collectively, may cast significant  doubt  on the Group's or Company's ability to continue  as a going concern for the going concern period.\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in Note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1 to be acceptable.\n\nThe related statement under the UK Listing Rules set out on page 190 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions  and as subsequent  events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent  with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions  are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.\n\n## Disclosures  of emerging and principal  risks and longer-term viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency  between the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal  risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nBased on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statement audit, we have nothing further to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \uf0a7 the Directors' confirmation within the viability statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including  those that would  threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \uf0a7 the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \uf0a7 the Directors' explanation  in the viability statement  of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention  to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nUnder the UK Listing  Rules we are also required to review the Viability Statement. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded  that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited  to assessing these matters in the context  of only the knowledge acquired during our financial  statement audit. As we cannot predict  all future events or conditions  and as subsequent  events may result in outcomes  that are inconsistent  with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements  is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longer-term viability.",

For example, the further removed non-compliance  with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing  standards would  identify it.\n\nIn addition,  as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection  of fraud, as these may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance  or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance  with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 6. OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced  by our application  of materiality.

We have scoped:\n\n- \uf0a7 Two components, the Pilbara and Oyu Tolgoi as individually  financially significant  components  which were subjected to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \uf0a7 Twelve further components subjected to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \uf0a7 Eight components subjected to audit of account  balances associated with significant  or elevated risks on either provision for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations  or asset valuations; and\n- \uf0a7 Fifteen futher components subjected to audit of account balances to ensure sufficient audit coverage.\n\n| Scope                    |   Number of components | Range of materiality applied   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Full scope audit         |                     14 | $32m - $250m                   |\n| Audit of account balance |                     23 | $32m - $125m                   |\n\nWe have also performed audit  procedures centrally across the Group, beyond the component  scope set out above, in the following areas:\n\n- \uf0a7 Testing of IT systems and configurations;\n- \uf0a7 Consolidation  of the financial information;\n- \uf0a7 Journal entry analytics, to identify journal entries with higher risk such as those posted by Group management into component  books, and manual entries into  accounts where these are not expected (e.g. revenue);\n- \uf0a7 Uncertain tax positions; and\n- \uf0a7 Pensions.\n\nIn addition,  we have performed group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWork on the key audit matters (detailed in section  3) was performed by a combination  of component  auditors and the group audit team.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nAs part of determining the scope and preparing our audit plan and strategy, the Group audit team held a global planning conference in London to discuss key audit risks and obtain input from component teams.\n\nThe Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant  areas to be covered, including  the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component  materialities, which ranged from $32m to $250m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the components.",

As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, site visits in 2020 were limited to the Pilbara, Perth and a virtual visit to Oyu Tolgoi. The Group team met with the local audit teams and with local Rio Tinto management to understand the performance of these business and the risks faced.\n\nAside from the site visits, frequent video conference calls were held throughout the audit with the component auditors. The Group audit team inspected  the component  team's key work papers related to the significant risks and assessed the appropriateness of conclusions and the consistency between reported findings and work performed. At these meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then  performed by the component  auditor\n\n## 8.

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n## Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nAs explained  more fully in their statement set out  on page 99, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements, including  being satisfied that they give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting frameworks; implementing such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group, Rio Tinto plc's and Rio Tinto Limited's ability to continue  as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting  is appropriate, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but  to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinions  in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) and ASAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually  or in aggregate,  they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the primary users taken on the basis of the financial  statements.\n\nA fuller description  of KPMG UK's responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

These APMs are used by management to assess the performance of the business and provide additional information which investors may find useful. APMs are presented in order to give further insight into the underlying business performance of the Group's operations.\n\nAPMs are not consistently defined and calculated by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, these measures used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies. Consequently, these APMs should not be regarded as a substitute for the IFRS measures and should be considered supplementary to those measures.\n\nThe following tables present the Group's key financial measures not defined according to IFRS and a reconciliation between those APMs and their nearest respective IFRS measure.\n\n## APMs derived from the income statement\n\nThe following income statement measures are used by the Group to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations and to enhance comparability of reporting periods. They indicate the underlying commercial and operating performance of our assets including revenue generation, productivity and cost management.\n\n## Gross product sales\n\nGross product sales includes the sales revenue of equity accounted units on a proportionately consolidated basis (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) in addition to consolidated sales. Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales to equity accounted units which are not included in gross product sales.\n\nGross product sales measures revenue on a basis that is comparable to our Underlying EBITDA metric.\n\n|                                                                                       | 2020 US$m   | 2019  US$m   | 2018 US$m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Consolidated sales revenue                                                            | 44,611      | 43,165       | 40,522      |\n| Share of equity accounted unit sales and inter-subsidiary/equity accounted unit sales | 2,407       | 2,202        | 2,313       |\n| Gross product sales (a)                                                               | 47,018      | 45,367       | 42,835      |\n\n(a) Gross product sales was previously referred to as Gross sales revenue in the 2019 Annual Report.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA\n\nUnderlying EBITDA represents earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto before tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation excluding the EBITDA impact of the same items that are excluded in arriving at underlying earnings (as defined on page 331).\n\n|                                                                                                           | 2020 US$m   | 2019  US$m   | 2018 US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Profit after tax                                                                                          | 10,400      | 6,972        | 13,925      |\n| Less (profits)/losses attributable to non-controlling interests                                           | (631)       | 1,038        | (287)       |\n| Profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (net earnings)                                       | 9,769       | 8,010        | 13,638      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries excluding capitalised depreciation                          | 4,074       | 4,272        | 3,909       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation in equity accounted units                                                   | 576         | 653          | 650         |\n| Finance items in subsidiaries                                                                             | 1,751       | 648          | 33          |\n| Taxation in subsidiaries                                                                                  | 4,991       | 4,147        | 4,242       |\n| Taxation and finance items in equity accounted units                                                      | 443         | 296          | 372         |\n| Add back profits/(losses) attributable to non-controlling interests                                       | 631         | (1,038)      | 287         |\n| Impairment charges                                                                                        | 1,272       | 3,487        | 132         |\n| (Gains)/losses on embedded commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting (including exchange) | (6)         | 260          | (279)       |\n| Net losses/(gains) on consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses                               | -           | 291          | (4,622)     |\n| Change in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)                                      | 401         | -            | 376         |\n| Gain on sale of wharf and land in Kitimat, Canada                                                         | -           | -            | (602)       |\n| Change in other exclusions                                                                                | -           | 171          | -           |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                                                                         | 23,902      | 21,197       | 18,136      |\n\n329",

Production /figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown, hence small differences may result from calculation of Rio Tinto share of production. Rio Tinto's interest in the Kestrel, Hail Creek, Dunkerque and Grasberg operations were sold in 2018. No data for these operations are included in the production table.\n\n- (a)  Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at the end of 2020. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years.\n- (b)  Jonqui\u00e8re's (Vaudreuil's) production shows smelter grade alumina only and excludes hydrate produced and used for specialty alumina.\n- (c)  Rio Tinto has a 22.95% shareholding in the Sangaredi mine but bene/fits from 45.0% of production.\n- (d)  Borate quantities are expressed as B 2 O 3 .\n- (e)  Rio Tinto owns a 33.52% indirect interest in Oyu Tolgoi through its 50.79% interest in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd.\n- (f) Includes 100% of production from Paraburdoo, Mt Tom Price, Marandoo, Yandicoogina, Brockman, Nammuldi, Silvergrass and the Eastern Range mines. Whilst Rio Tinto owns 54% of the Eastern Range mine, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Hamersley Iron manages the operation and is obliged to purchase all mine production from the joint venture and therefore all of the production is included in Rio Tinto's share of production.\n- (g)  Rio Tinto's ownership interest in Channar mine increased from 60% to 100%, following conclusion of its joint venture with Sinosteel Corporation upon reaching planned 290 million tonnes production on 22 October 2020. Production is reported at 100% from this date onward. Historic data is unchanged.\n- (h)  Quantities comprise 100% of Rio Tinto Fer et Titane and Rio Tinto's 74% share of Richards Bay Minerals' production. Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is being processed in Canada.\n- (i) ERA report drummed U 3 O 8 . In February 2020, our interest in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) increased from 68.4% to 86.3% as a result of new ERA shares issued to Rio Tinto under the Entitlement Offer and Underwriting Agreement to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area. Production is reported including this change from 1 March 2020.\n- (j) R\u00f6ssing report drummed U 3 O 8 . On 16 July 2019, Rio Tinto completed the sale of its entire interest in the R\u00f6ssing uranium mine in Namibia to China National Uranium Corporation Limited.",

        "page_content": "## Ore Reserves\n\nOre Reserves and Mineral Resources for Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (the JORC Code) as required by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Codes or guidelines similar to JORC with only minor regional variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, the US, Chile, Peru, the Philippines, the UK, Ireland and Europe. Together these Codes represent current best practice for reporting Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.\n\nThe JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long-term commodity prices, in calculating Ore Reserve estimates. However, for US reporting, the US Securities and Exchange Commission requires historical price data to be used. For this reason, some Ore Reserves reported to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those reported below.\n\nOre Reserve and Mineral Resource information in the tables below is based on information compiled by Competent Persons (as de/fined by JORC), most of whom are full time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies. Each has had a minimum of /five years' relevant estimation experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics. Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears. Competent Persons responsible for the estimates are listed on pages 350-351, by operation, along with their professional af/filiation, employer and accountability for Ore Reserves and/or Mineral Resources. Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto, the Ore Reserves are published as received from the managing company. The Ore Reserve /figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2020. Summary data for year end 2019 are shown for comparison. Metric units are used throughout. The /figures used to calculate Rio Tinto's share of Ore Reserves are often more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated /figures.\n\n|                                    |          | at end 2020         | at end 2020         | at end 2020                        | at end 2020                        | Total ore reserves 2020 compared with  2019 2020   | Total ore reserves 2020 compared with  2019 2020   | Total ore reserves 2020 compared with  2019 2020   | Total ore reserves 2020 compared with  2019 2020   | Average  mill   |             |                                            |\n|------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                    | Type of  | Proved ore reserves | Proved ore reserves | Probable ore reserves  at end 2020 | Probable ore reserves  at end 2020 | 2020                                               |                                                    |                                                    | 2019  2019                                         |                 |             |                                            |\n|                                    | mine (a) | Tonnage             | Grade               | Tonnage                            | Grade                              | Tonnage                                            | Tonnage                                            | Grade                                              | Grade                                              | recovery  %     | Interest  % | Rio Tinto share                            |\n| Bauxite (b)                        |          | millions  of tonnes | % Al 2 O 3          | millions  of tonnes                | % Al 2 O 3                         | millions  of tonnes                                | millions  of tonnes                                | % Al 2 O 3                                         | % Al 2 O 3                                         |                 |             | Recoverable   mineral millions   of tonnes |\n| Reserves at operating mines        |          |                     |                     |                                    |                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                 |             |                                            |\n| Gove (Australia) (c)               | O/P      | 77                  | 50.4                | 3.3                                | 49.7                               | 80                                                 | 131                                                | 50.4                                               | 49.3                                               |                 | 100.0       | 80                                         |\n| Porto Trombetas (MRN) (Brazil) (d) | O/P      | 19                  | 48.1                | 2.5                                | 48.5                               | 21                                                 | 33                                                 | 48.2                                               | 48.3                                               |                 | 12.0        | 3                                          |\n| Sangaredi (Guinea) (e)             | O/P      | 359                 | 47.1                | 37                                 | 48.1                               | 396                                                | 428                                                | 47.2                                               | 47.1                                               |                 | 23.0        | 91                                         |\n| Weipa (Australia) (f)              |          |                     |                     |                                    |                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                 |             |                                            |\n| -

As Rio Tinto only markets blended iron ore products from multiple mine sources, a detailed breakdown of constituent elements by individual deposit is not reported.\n- (t) The updated assessment of Ore Reserves re/flects measures Rio Tinto has put in place following the events in the Juukan Gorge on 24 May 2020. These measures are intended to protect a number of sites, and to mitigate impacts to sites where there are existing heritage approvals authorising mining impacts, or a decision has been made not to seek regulatory approval to conduct mining activities, given the heritage considerations identi/fied by Traditional Owners. As a result, Rio Tinto has removed 54 million dry tonnes from Reserves across Brockman 4, Western Range, Gudai-Darri, Greater Brockman 2 Nammuldi and West Angelas, including the 17 million dry tonnes at Western Range, which is the subject of a separate JORC Table 1 report. Rio Tinto's approach to cultural heritage management generally will continue to evolve in response to changes in agreements with Traditional Owners, further engagement with Traditional Owners and changing heritage legislation. Any material changes to Ore Reserves as a result of the further re/finement of Rio Tinto's approach will be disclosed at the appropriate time.\n- (u)  Channar (Brockman ore) Reserves were previously reported under Channar JV (Australia).

This material is de/fined as Mineral Resources under the JORC Code. Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors. While in the judgment of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic\n\nconditions in the future. As in the case of Ore Reserves, managed operations' estimates are completed using or testing against Rio Tinto long-term pricing and market forecasts/scenarios. Mineral Resources are stated as additional to the Ore Reserves reported earlier. Where operations are not managed by Rio Tinto, the Mineral Resources are published as received from the managing company. Where new project Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves are footnoted as being reported for the /first time, additional information about them can be viewed on the Rio Tinto website.\n\n|

The impact of the changes are not material to the total Resource. Rio Tinto's approach to cultural heritage management generally will continue to evolve in response to changes in agreements with Traditional Owners, further engagement with Traditional Owners and changing heritage legislation. Any material changes to Mineral Resources as a result of the further re/finement of Rio Tinto's approach will be disclosed at the appropriate time.\n- (t) Hamersley Iron (Australia) - Boolgeeda Resources are being reported for the /first time with the addition of the Poonda deposit.

This includes an annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at a Group level, as well as a review of /findings and progress from the Group Internal Audit programme.\n\n## Ore Reserves Steering Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Ore Reserves Steering Committee (ORSC), chaired by the Group Executive, Safety, Technical & Projects, meets at least quarterly. ORSC comprises senior representatives across our technical, /financial, governance and business groups and oversees the appointment of Competent Persons nominated by the business units, review of Exploration Results, Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve data prior to public reporting and the development of Group Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards and guidance.\n\n## Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2019, we created the Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence, which contains a dedicated Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance team. Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance, in conjunction with the ORSC, is the guardian and author of Group Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards and guidance and is responsible for the governance and compilation of Group Mineral Resource, Ore Reserve and reconciliation reporting. The technical assurance team also monitors the external reporting environment, facilitates internal audits and monitors actions with Group Internal Audit.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nThe Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve internal audits are conducted by independent external consulting personnel in a programme managed by Group Internal Audit with the assistance of the Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence and ORSC. During 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions, two internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve audits were completed remotely. Material /findings are reported outside of the product group reporting line to the Audit Committee, and all reports and action plans are reviewed by the ORSC for alignment to internal and external reporting standards.\n\n## Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have continued developing internal systems and controls in order to meet JORC compliance in all external reporting, including the preparation of all reported data by Competent Persons as members of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (The AusIMM), Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised professional organisations (RPOs). JORC Table 1 reports for new or materially upgraded signi/ficant deposits are released to the market; they are also available on the Group's website. JORC Table 1 and NI 43-101 technical reports generated by non-managed units or joint venture partners are referenced within the reporting footnotes with the location and initial reporting date identi/fied.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves from externally managed operations, in which Rio Tinto holds a minority share, are reported as received from the managing entity. Figures from our managed operations are the responsibility of the managing directors of the business units and estimates are carried out by Competent Persons as de/fined by JORC.\n\n## 2020 Highlights\n\n- -Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence with dedicated Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance team manage and assure the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting\n- -Ongoing professional development: over 25 hours of virtual Competent Persons workshops and training run\n- -Independent auditing: two remote Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve audits completed",

These expressions are used for convenience, since both companies, and other companies in which they directly or indirectly own investments, are separate and distinct legal entities. Likewise, the words 'we', 'us', 'our' and 'ourselves' are used in some places to refer to the companies of the Rio Tinto Group in general. These expressions are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying any particular company or companies. We usually omit 'Limited', 'plc', 'Pty', 'Inc.', 'Limitada', 'L.L.C.', 'A.S.' or 'SA' from Group company names, except to distinguish between Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. Financial data in US dollars ($) is derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the 2020 /financial statements. In general, where we have provided /financial data in pounds sterling (\u00a3) and Australian dollars (A$), it has been translated from the consolidated /financial statements, and is provided solely for convenience; exceptions arise where data has been extracted directly from source records. Certain key information has been provided in US dollars, pounds sterling and Australian dollars in the 2019 /financial statements.\n\n## History\n\nRio Tinto plc was incorporated on 30 March 1962 (then called The Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation Limited (RTZ)) and was formed by the merger of The Rio Tinto Company Limited and The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited. The Rio Tinto Company was incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper workings in Spain. The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited began operations in the early twentieth century as part of the Australian mining industry. Based at Broken Hill in New South Wales, it began mining silver, lead and zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and zinc smelting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited was incorporated on 17 December 1959 (then called The Rio Tinto Mining Company of Australia Pty Limited). In 1962 the Australian interests of The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited and The Rio Tinto Company Limited were merged to form Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited changed its name to CRA Limited.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA discovered important mineral deposits, developed major mining projects and grew through acquisition.\n\nRTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through a dual listed companies structure. In 1997, RTZ became Rio Tinto plc and CRA became Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Dual listed companies structure\n\nIn 1995, Rio Tinto shareholders approved the terms of the dual listed companies' merger (the DLC structure). The aim was to put shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position they would be in if they held shares in a single entity owning all assets of both companies.\n\nFollowing the approval of the DLC structure, both companies entered into a DLC Merger Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement). As part of this both companies agreed to be managed in a uni/fied way, to share the\n\nsame Board of Directors, and to put in place arrangements to provide shareholders of both companies with a common economic interest in the DLC structure.\n\nTo achieve this third objective, the Sharing Agreement /fixed the ratio of dividend, voting and capital distribution rights attached to each Rio Tinto plc share and each Rio Tinto Limited share at an Equalisation Ratio of 1:1. This has remained unchanged ever since, although the Sharing Agreement makes clear this can be revised in special circumstances, for example where certain modi/fications are made to the share capital of one company (such as rights issues, bonus issues, share splits and share consolidations) but not to the other.\n\nOutside the circumstances speci/fied in the Sharing Agreement, the Equalisation Ratio can only be altered with the approval of shareholders under the class rights action approval procedure, described in the Voting arrangements section below. Any adjustments must be con/firmed by the Group's external auditors.\n\nConsistent with the DLC structure, the directors of both companies aim to act in the best interests of Rio Tinto as a whole. The class rights action approval procedure exists to deal with instances where there may be a con/flict of interest between the shareholders of the two companies.\n\nTo ensure that the Boards of both companies are identical, resolutions to appoint or remove directors must be put to shareholders of both companies as Joint Decisions, described in the Voting arrangements section below. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited make clear that a person can only be a director of one company if he or she is also a director of the other. This means that if a person were removed as a director of Rio Tinto plc, he or she would also cease to be a director of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nOne consequence of the DLC merger is that Rio Tinto is subject to a wide range of laws, rules and regulatory reviews across multiple jurisdictions. Where these rules differ, Rio Tinto will comply with the requirements in each jurisdiction at a minimum.\n\n## Dividend arrangements\n\nThe Sharing Agreement ensures that dividends paid on Rio Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shares are equalised on a net cash basis without taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends are determined in US dollars and (with the exception of ADR holders, paid in sterling and Australian dollars) both companies are required to announce and pay dividends and other distributions at the same time or as close to this as/uni00A0possible.\n\nThe payment of dividends between companies and their subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends on the DLC dividend shares, provides the Group with /flexibility to manage internal funds and distributable reserves to enable the payment of equalised dividend or equalised capital/uni00A0distributions.\n\nIf the payment of an equalised dividend would contravene the law applicable to one of the companies, they can depart from the Equalisation Ratio. In that situation, the relevant company must put aside reserves for payment on the relevant shares at a later date.\n\nRio Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to enforce the dividend equalisation provisions of the Sharing Agreement.\n\n## Voting arrangements\n\nIn principle, the Sharing Agreement enables the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to vote as a joint electorate on any matters that affect them in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint Decisions, and include the creation of new classes of share capital, the appointment or removal of directors and auditors, and the receiving of annual /financial statements. All shareholder resolutions that include Joint Decisions are voted on a poll.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholder Information continued\n\nThe Sharing Agreement also protects shareholders of both companies by requiring joint approval for decisions that do not affect the shareholders of both companies equally. These are known as class rights actions, and are voted on a poll. For example, fundamental elements of the DLC structure cannot be changed unless approved separately by the shareholders of both companies.\n\nExceptions to these principles can arise in situations such as where legislation requires the separate approval of a decision by the appropriate majority of shareholders in one company, and where approval of the matter by shareholders of the other company is not required.\n\nWhere a matter has been expressly categorised as either a Joint Decision or a class rights action, the directors cannot change that categorisation. If a matter falls within both categories, it is treated as a class rights action. In addition, if an issue is not expressly listed in either category, directors can decide how it/uni00A0should be put to shareholders for approval.\n\nTo support joint voting arrangements, both companies have entered into shareholder voting agreements, where a Special Voting Share is issued to a special purpose company (SVC) and held in trust for shareholders by a common trustee. Rio Tinto plc (RTP) has issued its Special Voting Share (RTP Special Voting Share) to Rio Tinto Limited (RTL) Shareholder SVC, while Rio Tinto Limited has issued its Special Voting Share (RTL Special Voting Share) to RTP Shareholder SVC. The total number of votes cast on Joint Decisions by the shareholders of one company are decided at a parallel meeting of the other company. The exact role of these SVCs is described below.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, certain shareholders can be excluded from voting at their respective company's general meetings. For example, they may have acquired shares in the other company in excess of a given threshold without making an offer for all the shares in the other company. In this situation, votes cast by these excluded shareholders are disregarded.\n\nFollowing the companies' general meetings, the overall results of the voting are announced to relevant stock exchanges and the media, and published on the Rio Tinto website.\n\nAt a Rio Tinto plc shareholders' meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio Tinto plc share carries one vote. The holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto Limited in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast by public shareholders for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto Limited shareholders' meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto Limited ordinary shares do not hold voting shares in Rio Tinto plc by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto Limited, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\nSimilarly, at a Rio Tinto Limited shareholders' meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio Tinto Limited share carries one vote and the holder of its Special Voting Share will have one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto plc in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto plc shareholders' meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto plc ordinary shares do not hold any voting shares in Rio Tinto Limited by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto plc, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\n## Capital distribution arrangements\n\nIf either company goes into liquidation, the Sharing Agreement ensures a valuation is made of the surplus assets of both companies. If the surplus assets available for distribution by one company on each of the shares held by its shareholders exceed the surplus assets available for distribution by the other company on each of the shares held by its shareholders, then an equalising payment must be made - to the extent permitted by applicable law - such that the amount available for distribution on each share held by shareholders of both companies re/flects the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe aim is to ensure the shareholders of both companies have equivalent entitlements to the assets of the combined Group on a per share basis, taking account of the equalisation ratio.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement does not grant any enforceable rights to the shareholders of either company upon liquidation of either company.\n\n## Limitations on ownership of shares and merger obligations\n\nThe laws and regulations of the UK and Australia impose restrictions and obligations on persons who control interests in publicly listed companies in excess of de/fined thresholds. These can include an obligation to make a public offer for all outstanding issued shares of the relevant company. The threshold applicable to Rio Tinto plc under UK law and regulations is 30% and to Rio Tinto Limited under Australian law and regulations is 20% on both a standalone and Joint Decision basis.\n\nAs part of the DLC merger, the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited were amended with the aim of extending these laws and regulations to the combined enterprise. This amendment also ensures that a person cannot exercise control over one company without having made offers to the public shareholders of both companies.\n\nThis guarantees the equal treatment of both sets of shareholders, and that the two companies are considered as a single economic entity. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited impose restrictions on any person who controls, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the votes on a Joint Decision. If, however, such a person has an interest in either Rio Tinto Limited or Rio Tinto plc only, then the restrictions only apply if they control, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the votes at that company's general meetings.\n\nIf one of these thresholds is exceeded, the person cannot attend or vote at general meetings of the relevant company, cannot receive dividends or other distributions from the relevant company, and may be divested of their interest by the directors of the relevant company (subject to certain limited exceptions and noti/fication by the relevant company). These restrictions continue to apply until that person has either made a public offer for all the publicly held shares of the other company, has reduced their controlling interest below the thresholds speci/fied, or has acquired through a permitted means at least 50% of the publicly held shares of each company.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that offers for the publicly held shares of both companies would be required to avoid the restrictions set out above, even if the interests which breach the thresholds are held in just one of the companies. The directors do not have the discretion to exempt a person from the operation of these rules.\n\nUnder the Sharing Agreement, the companies agree to co-operate to enforce the above restrictions contained in their Articles of Association and Constitution.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn 1995, each company entered into a deed poll guarantee in favour of creditors of the other company. In addition, each company guaranteed the contractual obligations of the other and the obligations of other persons guaranteed by the other company, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\nBene/ficiaries under deed poll guarantees can make demands on the relevant guarantor without /first having recourse to the company or persons whose obligations are being guaranteed. The obligations of the guarantor under each deed poll guarantee expire upon termination of the Sharing Agreement and under other limited circumstances, but only in respect of obligations arising after such termination and, in the case of other limited circumstances, the publication and expiry of due notice.",

        "page_content": "## Material contracts\n\n## Articles of Association, Constitution, and DLC Sharing Agreement\n\nAs explained on pages 375-376, under the terms of the DLC structure shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and of Rio Tinto Limited entered into certain contractual arrangements designed to place the shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position as if they held shares in a single entity which owned all the assets of both companies. As far as is permitted by the UK Companies Act 2006, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and ASX Listing Rules, this principle is re/flected in the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and in the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited. The following summaries describe the material rights of shareholders of both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Objects\n\nAt the 2009 AGMs, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited approved amendments to their Articles of Association and Constitution whereby the object clauses were removed to allow the companies to have the widest possible scope of activities.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nUnder Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association, a director may not vote in respect of any proposal in which he or she, or any other person connected with him or her, has any interest, other than by virtue of his or her interests in shares or debentures or other securities of, in or through the company, except in certain circumstances, including in respect of resolutions:\n\n- -indemnifying him or her or a third party in respect of obligations incurred by the director on behalf of, or for the bene/fit of, the company, or in respect of obligations of the company, for which the director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity, security or guarantee;\n- -relating to an offer of securities in which he or she may be interested as a holder of securities or as an underwriter;\n- -concerning another body corporate in which the director is bene/ficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate;\n- -relating to an employee bene/fit in which the director will share equally with other employees;\n- -relating to liability insurance that the company is empowered to purchase for the bene/fit of directors of the company in respect of actions undertaken as directors (or of/ficers) of the company; and\n- -concerning the giving of indemnities in favour of directors or the funding of expenditure by directors to defend criminal, civil or regulatory proceedings or actions against a director.\n\nUnder Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, a director may be present at a meeting of the Board while a matter in which the director has a material personal interest is being considered and may vote in respect of that matter, except where a director is constrained by Australian law.\n\nThe directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the companies to borrow money, to charge any property or business of the companies or all, or any, of their uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or give any other security for a debt, liability or obligation of the companies or of any other person. The directors shall restrict the borrowings of Rio Tinto plc to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed by the company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed an amount equal to 1\u00bd times the companies' share capital plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the company.\n\nDirectors are not required to hold any shares of either company by way of quali/fication. The Remuneration Report on pages 140-185 provides information on shareholding policies relating to executive and non-executive directors. Please refer to the Directors' Report for information on the appointment of directors.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares\n\nUnder UK law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of pro/fits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and by the relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the directors. Directors may also pay shareholders interim dividends as justi/fied by the /financial position of the Group.\n\nUnder the Australian Corporations Act 2001, dividends on shares may only be paid if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared, the excess is suf/ficient for the payment of the dividend, the payment is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole, and the payment does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors. Any/uni00A0Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and returned to the company. Any Rio Tinto Limited dividend unclaimed may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the bene/fit of the company until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to Australian law. Rio Tinto Limited is governed by the State of Victoria's unclaimed monies legislation, which requires the company to pay to the state revenue of/fice any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that on 1 March each year have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.\n\n## Voting\n\nVoting at any general meeting of shareholders on a resolution on which the holder of the Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll, and any other resolution shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll has been duly demanded. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. The holder of the Special Voting Share is not entitled to vote in a show of hands. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote for every ordinary share for which he or she is the holder. In the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast in respect of the publicly held shares of the other company.\n\nA poll may be demanded by any of the following:\n\n- -the chairman of the meeting;\n- -at least /five shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution;\n- -any shareholder(s) representing in the aggregate not less than one tenth (Rio Tinto plc) or one 20 th (Rio Tinto Limited) of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution;\n- -any shareholder(s) holding Rio Tinto plc shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right; or\n- -the holder of the Special Voting Share of either company.\n\nA proxy form gives the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one.\n\nThe necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc general meeting is three members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative) and entitled to vote. For a Rio Tinto Limited general meeting it is two members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative).\n\nMatters are transacted at general meetings by the proposing and passing of/uni00A0resolutions as:\n\n- -ordinary resolutions (for example the election of directors), which require the af/firmative vote of a majority of persons voting at a meeting for which there is a quorum; and\n- -special resolutions (for example amending the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc or the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited), which require the af/firmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholder Information continued\n\nThe Sharing Agreement further classi/fies resolutions as Joint Decisions and class rights actions as explained on pages 375-376.\n\nAnnual general meetings must be convened with 21 days' written notice for Rio Tinto plc and with 28 days' notice for Rio Tinto Limited. In accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Rio Tinto plc AGM in 2020, other meetings of Rio Tinto plc may be convened with 14 days' written notice for the passing of a special resolution, and with 14/uni00A0days' notice for any other resolution, depending on the nature of the business to be transacted. All meetings of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited require 28/uni00A0days' notice. In calculating the period of notice, any time taken to deliver the notice and the day of the meeting itself are not included. The/uni00A0notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nIf, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to each class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the relevant legislation, the written consent of holders of threequarters in value of the shares of that class, or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association and Constitution relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum for Rio Tinto plc should be two or more persons who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class.\n\n## Rights upon a winding-up\n\nExcept as the shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon a winding-up, the balance of assets available for distribution after the payment of all creditors (including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors) and subject to any special rights attaching to any class of shares, is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution should generally be made in cash. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets in specie or kind.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement describes the distribution of assets of each of the companies in the event of a liquidation, as explained on pages 375-376.\n\n## Facility agreement\n\nDetails of the Group's $7.5 billion multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities are set out in note 29 to the 2020 /financial statements.\n\n## Exchange controls and foreign investment\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\nThere are no UK foreign exchange controls or other restrictions on the import or export of capital by, or on the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares, or that materially affect the conduct of Rio Tinto plc's operations. It should be noted, however, that various sanctions, laws, regulations or conventions may restrict the import or export of capital by, or the payment of dividends to, nonresident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares. There are no restrictions under Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association or under UK law that limit the right of non-resident owners to hold or vote Rio Tinto plc shares. However, certain of the provisions of the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Takeovers Act) described below also apply to the acquisition by non-Australian persons of interests in securities of Rio Tinto plc.\n\n## Rio Tinto Limited\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, Australia does not impose general exchange or foreign currency controls. Subject to some speci/fic requirements and restrictions, Australian and foreign currency may be freely brought into and sent out of Australia. There are requirements to report cash transfers in or out of Australia of A$10,000 or more. There is a prohibition on (or in some cases the speci/fic prior approval of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or Minister for Foreign Affairs must be obtained for) certain payments or other dealings connected with countries or parties identi/fied with terrorism, or to whom United Nations or autonomous Australian sanctions apply. Sanction, anti-money laundering and counterterrorism laws may restrict or prohibit payments, transactions and dealings or require reporting of certain transactions.\n\nRio Tinto Limited may be required to deduct withholding tax from foreign remittances of dividends, to the extent that they are unfranked, and from payments of interest.\n\nAcquisitions of interests in shares, and certain other equity instruments in Australian companies by non-Australian ('foreign') persons are subject to review and approval by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia under the Takeovers Act.\n\nIn broad terms, the Takeovers Act applies to acquisitions of interests in securities in an Australian entity by a foreign person where, as a result, a single foreign person (and any associate) would control 20% or more of the voting power or potential voting power in the entity, or several foreign persons (and any associates) would control 40% or more of the voting power or the potential voting power in the entity. The potential voting power in an entity is determined having regard to the voting shares in the entity that would be issued if all rights (whether or not presently exercisable) in the entity were exercised.\n\nThe Takeovers Act also applies to direct investments by foreign government investors, in certain circumstances regardless of the size of the investment. Persons who are proposing relevant acquisitions or transactions may be required to provide notice to the Treasurer before proceeding with the acquisition or transaction.\n\nThe Treasurer has the power to order divestment in cases where relevant acquisitions or transactions have already occurred, including where prior notice to the Treasurer was not required. The Takeovers Act does not affect the rights of owners whose interests are held in compliance with the legislation.\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nExcept for the provisions of the Takeovers Act, there are no limitations imposed by law, Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association or Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, on the rights of non-residents or foreigners to hold the Group's ordinary shares or ADRs, or to vote that would not apply generally to all shareholders.",

The Board may appoint a director either to /fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the Board, so long as the total number of directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in these constitutional documents. An appointed director must retire and seek election to of/fice at the next AGM of each company. In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001, the company may by ordinary resolution remove any director before the expiry of his or her period of of/fice and may, subject to these constitutional documents, by ordinary resolution appoint another person who is willing to act as a director in their place. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors are required to stand for re-election at each AGM.\n\n## Directors' powers\n\nThe Board manages the business of Rio Tinto under the powers set out in these constitutional documents. These powers include the directors' ability to issue or buy-back shares. Shareholders' authority to empower the directors to purchase its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year. The constitutional documents can only be amended, or replaced, by a special resolution passed in general meeting by at least 75% of the votes cast.\n\n## UK listing rules cross reference table\n\nThe following table contains only those sections of UK listing rule 9.8.4 C which are relevant.

All statements other than statements of/uni00A0historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, those regarding Rio Tinto's /financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Rio Tinto's products, production forecasts and reserve and resource positions), are forward-looking statements. The words 'intend', 'aim', 'project', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'plan', 'believes', 'expects', 'may', 'should', 'will', 'target', 'set to' or/uni00A0similar expressions, commonly identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and/uni00A0other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of/uni00A0Rio/uni00A0Tinto, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Rio/uni00A0Tinto's present and future business strategies and the environment in/uni00A0which Rio/uni00A0Tinto will operate in the future. Among the important factors that could cause Rio/uni00A0Tinto's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: an inability to live up to Rio Tinto's values and any resultant damage to its reputation; the impacts of geopolitics on trade and investment; the impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon future; an inability to successfully execute and/or realise value from acquisitions and divestments; the level of new ore resources, including the results of exploration programmes and/or acquisitions; disruption to strategic partnerships that play a material role in delivering growth, production, cash or market positioning; damage to Rio Tinto's relationships with communities and governments; an inability to attract and retain requisite skilled people; declines in commodity prices and adverse exchange rate movements; an inability to raise suf/ficient funds for capital investment; inadequate estimates of ore resources and reserves; delays or overruns of large and complex projects; changes in tax regulation; safety incidents or major hazard events; cyber breaches; physical impacts from climate change; the impacts of water scarcity; natural disasters; an inability to successfully manage the closure, reclamation and rehabilitation of sites; the impacts of civil unrest; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; breaches of Rio Tinto's policies, standard and procedures, laws or regulations; trade tensions between the world's major economies; increasing societal and investor expectations, in particular with regard to environmental, social and governance considerations; the impacts of technological advancements; and such other risks identi/fied in Rio Tinto's most recent Annual Report and accounts in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F /filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') or Form 6-Ks furnished to, or /filed with, the SEC. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors/uni00A0and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only/uni00A0as of the date of this report. Rio Tinto expressly disclaims any/uni00A0obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the UK/uni00A0Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the/uni00A0Financial Conduct Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to re/flect any change in Rio Tinto's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nNothing in this report should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.",
