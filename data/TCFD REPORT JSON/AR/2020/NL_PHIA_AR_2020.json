At the same time we continued to support people with their personal health. More than ever, we have the potential to accelerate the transformation of healthcare with our innovative solutions.' '\n\nFrans van Houten CEO Royal Philips\n\n## Dear Stakeholder,\n\nIn 2020, Philips again demonstrated its relevance in bringing meaningful innovation to improve people's health and well-being, as we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a company, we continue to focus on delivering against our triple duty of care - meeting critical customer needs, safeguarding the health and safety of our employees, and ensuring business continuity.\n\nOur employees displayed flexibility and resourcefulness as we more than quadrupled output of acute care equipment and solutions to help frontline healthcare workers diagnose, treat, monitor and manage COVID-19 patients. We significantly increased production of critical care ventilators, provided ICU monitoring & analytics solutions, and rolled out telehealth solutions to relieve the pressure on scarce resources. And our field service engineers worked round the clock to support healthcare providers in their hour of need.\n\nIn parallel, we continued to support health systems with the delivery of regular care, entering into multiple long-term strategic partnerships - all featuring resultoriented business models - to transform healthcare by enhancing patient care and improving productivity. We also found new ways to serve consumers seeking to live a healthy life, prevent disease and proactively manage their own health. In total, our products and solutions improved the lives of 1.75 billion people in 2020, including 207 million people in underserved communities.\n\nOverall, our company performance proved resilient. While some of our businesses were affected by lower demand, others were able to significantly increase deliveries. I would like to express my admiration and gratitude for the way in which the extended Philips family - our employees, our suppliers and partners,\n\nthe Philips Foundation - pulled together with our customers to address the impact of the pandemic.\n\n## Affirmation of our strategy\n\nThe developments of the past year validate our strategy to innovate the provision of care along the health continuum - putting the patient at the center, improving diagnosis and treatment pathways, enabling the integration of care across care settings, and increasing care provider productivity. At the same time, we help consumers to live healthier lifestyles and to cope with chronic disease. Increasingly, we are able to connect home and hospital care through telehealth platforms. This approach is resonating more strongly than ever.\n\nCustomers appreciate the comprehensive and strategic view we take of the future of health and healthcare. They want innovative solutions - smart combinations of systems, devices, informatics, data and services - that can help them deliver on the Quadruple Aim of better health outcomes, improved patient experience, improved staff experience, and lower cost of care. Given the learnings from COVID-19, they are especially keen to discover how we can support care outside the hospital.\n\nIn recent years, we have invested significantly in data science, informatics and cloud technology to enable the delivery of integrated solutions across the health continuum, and across care settings. These investments are now paying off, with a rapid increase in adoption of, for example, e-ICU and telehealth solutions that facilitate collaboration between health professionals and patient engagement.",

COVID-19 has accelerated the digitalization of care and the adoption of telehealth. This shift is being reinforced by global trends such as aging populations, the rise of chronic diseases, and resource constraints.\n\nInnovative health technology can help health systems address these challenges, as well as extend access to care to those in need. The HealthTech market is a very attractive and sizable one, with considerable growth and margin potential, and Philips already holds strong leadership positions in over 65% of our portfolio.\n\nInspired by our purpose to improve people's health and well-being, we invest almost 10% of revenue in Research & Development to innovate solutions that make a difference to our customers and society at large. Helping people to stay healthy and prevent disease, for instance through our expanding teledentistry services. Giving clinicians AI-assisted tools like our new Radiology Workflow Suite that help them make precision diagnoses and select the best care pathway. Helping surgeons deliver personalized, minimally invasive treatment with solutions like our constantly evolving Azurion image-guided therapy platform. And outside the hospital - orchestrating and delivering care in lower-cost care settings, helping people to recover, or live with chronic disease, at home.\n\nAll of these require a seamless flow of data, which is enabled by our highly secure connected care solutions, such as our IntelliVue MX750/MX850 patient monitors for the ICU. To unlock the full benefits of data-enabled care, we continue to expand our capabilities in informatics and data science, with around half of our R&D professionals working in these areas.\n\n## Doing business responsibly and sustainably\n\nIn 2020, we underscored our determination to lead by example by renewing our purpose - to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation, with the aim of improving 2 billion lives per year by 2025, including 300 million in underserved communities, rising to 2.5 billion and 400 million respectively by 2030.\n\nThis is part of an enhanced, fully integrated approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably. Building on our strong heritage in environmental and social responsibility, this new framework comprises a comprehensive set of key\n\ncommitments across the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dimensions that guide our endeavors. I am convinced this is the best way for Philips to create superior, long-term value for our many stakeholders.\n\nI am pleased that we have delivered on all the targets set out in our Healthy people, Sustainable planet 2016-2020 program. As a purpose-driven company, we are conscious of our responsibility towards society and of the need to continue to embed sustainability ever deeper in the way we do business. Having become carbon-neutral in our own operations in 2020, we are now extending our ambitions and working with our partners to ensure that emissions across our entire value chain are in line to limit global warming to the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario.\n\nWe received further recognition for our efforts in this area in 2020 - achieving a CDP 'A List' rating for the eighth consecutive year for our action on climate change, and securing the second-highest place in both the global Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) list and The Wall Street Journal's new ranking, 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies in the World.\n\n## Our performance in 2020\n\nCOVID-19 impacted every part of our business in 2020. Nevertheless, despite the challenging circumstances, we were able to execute our plans and return to growth in the second half of the year. For the full year we delivered 3% comparable sales growth *) and a strong free cash flow *) of EUR 1.9 billion. Comparable order intake **) increased 9% and we made market share gains in a number of our health systems businesses.\n\nOur Diagnosis & Treatment businesses were impacted by the ongoing postponement of capital equipment installations and routine care, including elective procedures, yet continued to deliver a steady flow of innovations designed to help clinicians deliver a precision diagnosis leading to targeted therapies.\n\nOur Connected Care businesses posted exceptional growth, fueled by COVID-19-related demand for our hospital ventilation and monitoring & analytics solutions.\n\nOur Personal Health businesses had to contend with a steep decrease in consumer demand brought about by the onset of COVID-19, yet rebounded strongly by accelerating online growth, increasing digital engagement, entering into partnerships with leading retailers, and scaling direct-to-consumer business models.\n\nWe initiated the process to create a separate legal structure for our Domestic Appliances business within the Philips Group, and we expect to complete this process by Q3 2021.",

        "page_content": "We made several acquisitions in 2020. For instance, we expanded our imageguided therapy devices portfolio, acquiring Intact Vascular to add an industry-first implantable device to treat peripheral artery disease. We also agreed to acquire BioTelemetry (completed on February 9, 2021) and Capsule Technologies to strengthen our Connected Care segment. These acquisitions will further broaden and scale our patient care management solutions for the hospital and the home, enhance patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows and increase productivity.\n\nLooking ahead, we continue to see uncertainty related to the impact of COVID-19 across the world. For 2021, Philips plans to deliver low-single-digit comparable sales growth *) , driven by solid growth in Diagnosis & Treatment and Personal Health, partly offset by lower Connected Care sales, and an Adjusted EBITA margin *) improvement of 60-80 basis points.\n\nReflecting our confidence in the future course of the company and the importance we attach to dividend stability, we propose to maintain the dividend at EUR 0.85 per share.\n\n## Transforming to create greater value\n\nAs we continue our transformation into a customer-first solutions company, we are guided by our strategic roadmap, with its three key imperatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Further improving the customer experience and operational excellence\n- \u00b7 Boosting growth in the core by innovating to extend category leadership, geographic expansion, and deeper customer partnerships\n- \u00b7 Winning with solutions to support consumers with their personal health, and to help professional healthcare customers achieve the Quadruple Aim.\n\nWe aim to drive customer preference by getting even closer to our customers and consumers, making Philips easier to do business with, and further improving our quality, operational excellence and productivity. To do this, we are driving the digital transformation in every area of our business, leveraging our integrated IT landscape - from the way we connect and engage with our customers and consumers to seamlessly connecting our solutions, e.g. to enable remote servicing and upgrades.\n\nIn our core business we aim to drive growth through innovation by capturing geographic growth opportunities and by continuing the pivot to consultative customer partnerships and business models, which offer a deeper relationship, with recurring revenue streams.\n\nWe will also continue the shift towards integrated solutions with demonstrable clinical evidence and health economic benefits that help our customers achieve the Quadruple Aim. In doing so, we will leverage data science and AI at scale.\n\nWhere appropriate, we will continue to make acquisitions and enter into partnerships to support our organic growth.\n\nBy working in accordance with the Philips Business System and executing on these imperatives with urgency and discipline, we will be able to create more value for our stakeholders - driving customer preference, sustained growth, margin expansion, increased cash flow and improved return on invested capital, while delivering on our ESG commitments.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nOnce again, I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and partners for working together with Philips in the fight against coronavirus. I also want to express my gratitude to our employees for their commitment, resourcefulness and hard work in difficult circumstances. And I wish to thank our shareholders for the confidence they continue to show in Philips.\n\nOur strategic focus and commitment to improvement remain undiminished. Energized by our purpose and buoyed by the resilience and agility I have seen over the past year, I am confident in Philips' ability to maintain our transformation momentum, truly impact global health challenges through innovation, and deliver sustained value for our many, diverse stakeholders.\n\n## Frans van Houten\n\nChief Executive Officer",

Never has this central tenet been more important than it is now, in these challenging times.\n\nAs a leading health technology company, we believe that innovation can improve people's health and healthcare outcomes, as well as making care more accessible and affordable. In concrete terms, we aim to improve the lives of 2 billion people a year by 2025, including 300 million in underserved communities, rising to 2.5 billion and 400 million respectively by 2030.\n\nGuided by this purpose, it is our strategy to lead with innovative solutions that combine systems, smart devices, informatics and services, and leverage big data helping our customers deliver on the Quadruple Aim (better health outcomes, improved patient experience, improved staff experience, lower cost of care) and helping people to take better care of their health at every stage of life.\n\nWe strive to deliver superior, long-term value to our customers and shareholders, while acting responsibly towards our planet and society, in partnership with our stakeholders.\n\nWe aim to grow Philips responsibly and sustainably. To this end, we have deployed a comprehensive set of commitments across all the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dimensions that guide the execution of our strategy and support our contribution to UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ), 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\n## Our view on healthcare\n\nHealth technology is a large market, which is expected to grow by around 4% each year *) . Besides the natural drivers of growth - aging populations, the rise of chronic diseases, increased spending on healthcare in emerging markets - we believe that health technology will be a major growth driver in the years to come.\n\nAt Philips, we see healthcare as a continuum, since it puts people's health journeys front and center and builds upon the idea of integrated care pathways. Believing that healthcare should, and can, be seamless, efficient and effective, we strive to 'connect the dots' for our customers and consumers, supporting the flow of data needed to care for people in real time, wherever they are.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoing forward, the digitalization of healthcare and - accelerated by COVID-19 the more widespread adoption of telehealth will play an increasing role in helping people to live healthily and cope with disease, and in enabling care providers to meet people's health needs, deliver better outcomes and improve productivity.\n\n## Helping our customers address their healthcare challenges\n\nIn the consumer domain, we develop innovative solutions that support healthier lifestyles, prevent disease, and help people to live well with chronic illness, also in the home and community settings.\n\nIn addition to leveraging retail trade partnerships and new business models, we are accelerating growth through online channels, delivering products and services direct to consumers, and supporting longer-term relationships to maximize the benefit consumers can derive from our solutions.\n\nIn clinics and hospitals, we are teaming up with healthcare providers to innovate and transform the way care is delivered. We listen closely to our customers' needs and together we co-create solutions that help our customers improve outcomes, patient and staff experience and productivity, and so deliver on the Quadruple Aim of value-based care.\n\nIncreasingly, we are working together with our health systems customers in novel business models, including outcome-oriented payment models, that align their interests and ours in long-term partnerships. The combination of compelling solutions and consultative partnership contracts, including a broad range of professional services, drives growth rates above the group average, as well as a higher proportion of recurring revenues.",

In 2020, the reportable segments were Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, Connected Care businesses, and Personal Health businesses, each having been responsible for the management of its business worldwide. Additionally, Philips identifies the segment Other.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Total sales by reportable segment\n\n|                       | 2020   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 42%    |\n| Connected Care        | 28%    |\n| Personal Health       | 28%    |\n| Other                 | 2%     |\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses 3.3.1\n\nOur Diagnosis & Treatment businesses create value through their unique portfolio of innovative diagnostic and minimally invasive procedural solutions - suites of systems, smart devices, software and services powered by AI-enabled informatics. With these integrated solutions, we enable our customers to realize the full potential of the Quadruple Aim - better health outcomes, improved patient experience, improved staff experience, and lower cost of care.\n\nIn Precision Diagnosis, serving diagnostic enterprise imaging markets globally, there is significant opportunity to enable precise diagnoses while at the same time supporting adjacent needs for guidance into care pathways and increasing departmental productivity. We do this through breakthrough innovations in our smart diagnostic systems, through dynamic workflow solutions that transform departmental operations, through integrated diagnostics insights from different departments, and through care pathway solutions that allow doctors to diagnose with precision and select the optimal treatment path for the individual patient. Over the period 2019-2020, 60% of our product portfolio in this area has been renewed through the discontinuance of former products, the roll-out of newgeneration versions of our products, and the addition of new products.\n\nIn Image Guided Therapy, we have pivoted from a focus on imaging modalities to integrated procedural solutions combining systems and therapeutic devices, which can drive more effective treatment, better outcomes and higher productivity. Building upon our leading-edge Azurion platform, we continue to innovate and expand our applications for image-guided therapies and improve workflow and integration in the interventional suite. We are also expanding into adjacent therapeutic areas and innovating the way we engage with our customers in new business models across different care settings, including out-of-hospital settings such as office-based labs and ambulatory surgical centers, which offer clear clinical, financial and operational benefits.\n\nIn 2020, the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses were impacted by the postponement of capital equipment installations and routine care, including elective procedures and exams, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even so, we continued to make advances in innovation and in strengthening our portfolio. For example, we expanded our remote clinical collaboration and virtual training offerings across our portfolio with the acquisition of Innovative Imaging Technologies (IIT) and its Reacts collaborative platform. Leveraging innovative technologies, such as augmented reality for remote virtual guidance, supervision and training, the platform provides unique interactive tools designed to meet the multi-faceted collaborative needs of healthcare professionals and patients. We also launched the vendor-agnostic Radiology Workflow Suite of end-to-end solutions to drive operational and clinical efficiency through the digitalization, integration, and virtualization of radiology. And we further expanded our Interventional Devices portfolio, acquiring Intact Vascular to add an industry-first implantable device, the Tack Endovascular System, to treat peripheral artery disease.\n\nThrough our various businesses, Diagnosis & Treatment is focused on growing market share and profitability by leveraging:\n\n- \u00b7 our strong position in Enterprise Diagnostic Informatics with the successful integration of Carestream Health's Healthcare Information Systems business,",

Sales are mostly driven by a direct salesforce with an intimate knowledge of the procedures that use our integrated solutions' smart devices, systems, software and services. Philips works with customers and partners to co-create solutions, drive commercial innovation and adapt to new models such as monitoring-as-aservice.\n\nSales at Philips' Connected Care businesses are generally higher in the second half of the year, largely due to customer spending patterns. In 2020 this pattern shifted due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt year-end 2020, the Connected Care businesses had around 16,000 employees worldwide.\n\n- In Q4 2020, the Aging and Caregiving portion of the Population Health Management business was split in anticipation of its future divestment. The remaining Population Health Management business has been combined with the Connected Care Informatics business for presentational purposes, and from January 1, 2021, the Connected Care Informatics business and the remaining portion of the Population Health Management business have been combined for reporting purposes. *)\n\n## 2020 business highlights\n\nIn the face of the global shortage of ventilators and patient monitors upon the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked intensively, together with our supply chain partners around the world, to drive a massive ramp-up in production, increasing ventilator manufacturing eightfold and monitor production fivefold.\n\nPhilips introduced Rapid Equipment Deployment Kits for ICU ramp-ups, allowing doctors, nurses, technicians and hospital staff to quickly support critical care patients.

We believe we are well positioned to capture further growth in online sales and continue to build our digital and e-commerce capabilities.\n\nWe are leveraging connectivity to offer new business models, partnering with other players in the health ecosystem, e.g. insurance companies, with the goal of extending opportunities for people to live healthily, prevent or manage disease. We are engaging consumers in their health journey in new and impactful ways through social media and digital innovation.\n\nFor example, the Philips Sonicare app acts as a 'virtual hub' for personal oral healthcare, helping users to manage their complete oral care on a daily basis and share brushing data with their dental practitioners, putting personalized guidance and advice at their fingertips. In our drive to innovate oral healthcare, we are partnering with leading insurance companies, which are moving to more preventative models of care. To that end, they need to encourage consumers to brush twice per day, for two minutes at a time, as that leads to better health outcomes and lower cost of care. The first results from the pilot program are extremely promising. Solutions and services like this offer a win-win for consumers and insurers: for consumers, because they get better oral care, and for insurance companies, because they have less cost per patient.\n\nWe also offer mobile solutions to support parents and parents-to-be for a more informed, more connected and healthier journey to parenthood. Powered by personalized AI and deep analytics, the Pregnancy+ app and Baby+ app offer parents supportive content at every stage of their first 1,000-day journey. Pregnancy+ also offers state-of-the-art, photo-realistic and interactive 3D fetal models to make the experience even more exciting. In 2020, to help expectant mothers navigate pregnancy in times of the pandemic, we introduced an in-app COVID-19 guide. As of year-end 2020, the Pregnancy+ app and Baby+ app combined have almost 2 million daily active users in over 50 countries.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4 Strategy and Businesses\n\nIn 2020, we opened prime locations in Cambridge and Pittsburgh (USA) and substantially invested in our campus in Eindhoven-North (Netherlands), to create an engaging workplace that will help attract and retain the best talent. We have driven productivity by optimizing our footprint globally and reduced the number of sites through post-acquisition integration programs.\n\nIn line with our Environmental ESG commitment towards 2025, as well as our commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we are actively optimizing our real estate portfolio. Since 2018, our site-related CO2 emissions related to fossil fuel consumption have been reduced by over 10%, and we have met our goal of bringing those CO2 emissions under 35 kilotonnes per year.\n\nThe vast majority of our locations consist of leased property, and we manage these closely to keep the overall vacancy rates of our property below 5% and to ensure the right level of space efficiency and flexibility to follow our business dynamic. Occupancy rates in Philips office locations were reduced during 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and this trend is expected to continue in 2021. The net book value of our land and buildings at December 31, 2020, represented EUR 1,374 million; construction in progress represented EUR 65 million. Our current facilities are adequate to meet the requirements of our present and foreseeable future operations.\n\n## Our geographies 3.4\n\n## Our Markets 3.4.1\n\nWe operate three market groups - North America, Greater China and International Markets (consisting of seven regions) - which are active in more than 100 countries worldwide.\n\nThe Markets' core objective is to understand local market/customer needs, to develop and manage the relationship with existing and new customers, and to deliver orders. As such, the market organizations are also responsible for the market-oriented profit-and-loss account (P&L) and balance sheet. They translate the voice of the customer into the innovation process, bring relevant products and solutions to market, and ensure local (solution) delivery and service execution, as well as managing the (integral) go-to-market approaches to our key customers and indirect channels - all with the aim of maximizing long-term customer value and gaining market share.\n\nTo take quick decisions that are locally relevant and as close to the customer as possible, our Businesses and Markets work closely together in Business-Market Combinations (BMCs) - Image Guided Therapy Systems-DACH (Germany, Austria & Switzerland), for example. The BMC makes agreements where to compete and\n\nhow to win. Businesses and Markets bear joint accountability for managing the operational end-to-end consumer and customer value chain, Quality & Regulatory compliance and the collaborative P&L, while leveraging the functional excellence and shared infrastructure of the company.\n\n## Macro-economic landscape in 2020 3.4.2\n\nIn 2020, the world economy experienced a sharp recession, owing to the lockdown measures taken to combat the coronavirus outbreaks. According to Oxford Economics, global real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 3.9% in 2020, compared with the 2.5% growth estimated in 2019 for 2020. Across Philips' markets, only Greater China is estimated to have shown growth in 2020, while the rest of the markets all suffered full-year recessions to various degrees. Looking ahead, Oxford Economics expects global real GDP growth to reach 5.0% in 2021.\n\n## 2020 highlights from our Market Groups 3.4.3\n\n## North America\n\nIn a year shaped by the pandemic, Philips helped customers roll out more than 8,000 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients. We quickly introduced the Rapid Equipment Deployment Kit, a self-service 20-bed ICU that can be deployed in hours thanks to remote clinical training, installation, and set-up. We also developed ultrasound solutions for COVID-19 detection at the point of care.\n\nPhilips increased ventilator production multifold to meet the high COVID-19-related demand, and shipped ventilators across the world using a fair and ethical approach to allocate supply to acute patient demands based on COVID-19 data and the available critical care capacity. Following Philips' delivery of 12,300 bundled EV300 ventilator configurations to the US Strategic National Stockpile in line with the contract signed in April 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services cancelled the delivery of the remaining 30,700 ventilators.\n\nOur commitment to improving lives through meaningful innovation continued in our partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs (VA), where we are working to advance AI technology for early detection of COVID-19 and tele-critical care technologies and services. VA signed a 10-year contract, which enables it to invest up to USD 100 million with Philips to create the world's largest tele-ICU system and extend access to intensive care expertise for veterans, regardless of their location.\n\nWe expanded our strategic relationships with local health systems, including Steward Health Care, which signed a nine-year, multi-vendor services contract with Philips, making us their strategic partner of choice. The University of Kentucky's UK HealthCare worked with Philips to power the state's only eICU Clinical Command Center, which will help them in care provisioning for COVID-19",

In addition, Tampa General signed a seven-year strategic partnership with Philips to provide the hospital with new patient monitoring solutions, imaging equipment, healthcare informatics, workflow solutions and consulting.\n\nPhilips Sonicare is the sonic toothbrush brand most recommended by US dental professionals, and our Professional Teledentistry program has made it easier for consumers to maintain wellness from home through the pandemic. Philips maintains a No. 1 market share in male grooming (electric). We are also one of the leading brands in reusable baby bottles and our Pregnancy+ apps are amongst the fastest-growing for new parents.\n\n## Greater China\n\nIn 2020 we continued our efforts to provide innovative health technology solutions in support of China's national health strategy, Healthy China 2030 - the action program designed to promote the health of China's 1.4 billion people.\n\nWe signed a multi-year contract with the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, one of China's leading hospitals, to support its expansion and upgrading. Combining clinical, research and education, this deal includes Ultrasound, Image Guided Therapy and Monitoring Analytics & Therapeutic Care solutions.\n\nPhilips helped Beijing Ditan Hospital, a top 3A hospital specially designated for COVID-19 care, to upgrade its ICU facility and capability with IntelliSpace Critical Care and Anaesthesia solutions supporting 41 ICU beds.\n\nPhilips provided cardiology solutions, including MR, Digital Subtraction Angiography and customer services, to Hong Kong Asia Heart Center, a private medical group dedicated to the treatment, rehabilitation and prevention of heart disease.\n\nFor consumers, we introduced our new SkinIQ range shaver, powered by the breakthrough Philips skin technology SkinIQ, recording record-breaking sales of 30,000 units sold on launch day on Tmall (S5000) and increasing total Male Grooming sell-out by 39% on JD (S7000). We also collaborated with Tmall Innovation Center to launch Philips' first C2B (Consumer to Business) shaver, with 160,000 pieces selling out in a month - a new benchmark in the industry.\n\n## International Markets\n\nIn our international markets, Philips entered into many new customer partnerships, including the following:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Philips was awarded a 7-year strategic partnership with South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, with a workforce of around 9,000 providing a range of specialist regional services to 1.5 million people. This\n\ncollaboration will utilize Philips' innovative Vue PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) technology and VNA (Vendor-Neutral Archiving) capability to support the Trust in connecting and integrating imaging facilities across multiple regional locations to provide seamless image sharing. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, Philips rapidly arranged for delivery of vital health technology equipment and provided remote simulation-based training sessions that enabled life-saving techniques without putting healthcare professionals at further risk.\n\nIn Germany, Philips entered into an 8-year strategic partnership Paracelsus Clinics, offering solutions that maximize the availability of imaging systems and leverage digitalization and process optimization to realize quality and efficiency improvements. And we signed a 10-year strategic partnership with Marienhospital Stuttgart to deploy our digital healthcare solutions across multiple departments to improve patient care and efficiency.\n\nIn the Benelux, Philips and Flevo Hospital signed a 10-year strategic partnership agreement to support precision diagnosis and optimize workflows and patient pathways, while driving efficiencies and cost optimization. We also renewed our long-term partnership with Alrijne Hospital in Leiderdorp and agreed a 5-year partnership with the Franciscus Gasthuis and Vlietland hospital in Rotterdam. We worked together with Erasmus University Medical Centre, Jeroen Bosch Hospital and the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport to launch the COVID-19 portal - a solution to enable hospitals to digitally exchange patient data and images, when COVID-19 patients are relocated between hospitals. Some 95% of Dutch hospitals are connected to the portal.\n\nIn France, the strategic partnership signed in 2015 with Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL) has once again proven to be productive and fruitful. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we teamed up to develop an AI-based CT lung assessment tool, the full version of which was launched at the Radiological Society of North America event RSNA 2020.\n\nIn Spain, Philips and the Hospital San Joan de D\u00e9u in Barcelona signed an agreement to renew the pediatric surgical block, incorporating the most advanced technology for minimally invasive procedures. In this way, surgeons at the Hospital will have high-resolution images, and even augmented reality in real time, of the area on which they are operating.\n\nIn Italy, Philips successfully participated in public tenders to supply hospitals fighting the COVID-19 emergency with ICU equipment - including over 3.000 monitors in the first half of the year alone - as well as Ultrasound and Therapeutic Care devices.",

The Region now has a single system for storing, retrieving, and viewing clinical images across all the locations and specialties in its extensive healthcare system, serving approximately 300 radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists performing 1.5 million exams yearly.\n\nSupporting the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, we sped up delivery of IntelliVue X3 monitors to meet the increased care capacity needs of Swedish hospitals in the face of COVID-19.\n\nIn Indonesia, Philips signed a seven-year strategic partnership agreement with Mandaya Royal Hospital Puri, providing a turnkey solution combining the latest innovations in enterprise diagnostic imaging, connected care and informatics, as well as service, maintenance and financing.\n\nIn South Korea, Philips secured a deal with Sejong Chungnam National University Hospital (CNUH) to provide an extensive range of Diagnostic Imaging and Image Guided Therapy solutions.\n\nIn Japan, we launched our Philips Lumify with Reacts handheld tele-ultrasound solution - with a novel subscription model - to enable powerful diagnostics at the bedside.\n\nIn Colombia, we signed our first deal for the implementation of EMR (Electronic Medical Record) and interoperability solutions with Santa Fe de Bogota Foundation. The agreement covers the replacement of its central information system with a comprehensive healthcare informatics solution with interoperable digital technology that improves its operational and administrative infrastructure, and overall patient experience.\n\nIn Turkey, Philips is a solutions partner of Basaksehir City Hospital. To help fight the pandemic, we installed more than 2,200 clinical and imaging devices across all modalities within three weeks, two months earlier than planned. We also signed a partnership agreement with one of the country's largest dental hospital chains, Dent Group.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Philips won a strategic deal to supply almost 3,000 patient monitors to help in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nSupporting the increased demand for flexible ICU capacity, Philips introduced its new mobile ICUs in India. The ICUs can be furnished with a range of medical equipment, including ventilators, defibrillators, and patient monitoring.\n\n## Supply chain and procurement 3.5\n\n## Supply chain 3.5.1\n\nPhilips runs an Integrated Supply Chain, which encompasses supplier selection and management through procurement, manufacturing across all the industrial sites, logistics and warehousing operations, as well as demand/supply orchestration.\n\nStriving for a balanced 'regional vs global' approach, the Integrated Supply Chain supports our business expansion, ensuring adequate capacity and speed while leveraging our global processes, standards and capabilities aligned with our industrial footprint strategy to become more efficient and effective.\n\nIn order to improve demand forecasting accuracy and manage inventories more efficiently, we piloted the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in our North American operations in the Personal Health business. We achieved an improved forecast accuracy of more than 20% and better fill rates, leading to increased customer satisfaction. We are now in the process of rolling this out to the rest of the world.\n\nWhen selecting and evaluating partners, we consider not only business metrics such as cost, quality and on-time delivery performance, but also environmental, social and governance factors. We use supplier classification models to identify critical suppliers, including those supplying materials, components and services that could influence the safety and performance of our products and solutions.\n\nSince 2017, Philips has been consolidating its manufacturing footprint into versatile 'multi-modality' manufacturing sites that produce multiple product categories and are located within or near the regions they serve, for enhanced scale, efficiency, and customer proximity. As of the end of 2020, 25 sites have been closed or divested. During the same period, Philips has acquired 10 sites. We have also started to transform our warehousing and distribution operations into a more customer-centric and agile network that is more responsive to market volatility. In the last two years, we have reduced our warehousing footprint by 28% through, among other things, consolidation and servicing of multiple businesses from a single location.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has tested the resilience and ingenuity of our people and partners in every part of our integrated supply chain, as we adjusted production capacity to the fluctuations in market demand. We teamed up with partners such as KLM to establish air corridors to enable us to supply essential healthcare equipment and solutions during the lockdown periods. We worked closely with our manufacturing sites as well our suppliers to deal with local (partial) lockdowns and safeguard a reliable supply of components and parts, prioritizing delivery of critical equipment to those in need.",

Under these circumstances, the Procurement function was focused on managing uninterrupted supplies to enable Philips to provide critical life-saving healthcare equipment and solutions to our customers all over the world. For example, we had to make a steep ramp-up in the production of ventilators from 1,000 per week to 4,000 per week within a short period of 5 months. This necessitated significant investments in our own plants, as well as close cooperation with our contract manufacturers and parts suppliers, to ensure the availability of the significantly increased capacity. In certain cases, we needed to shift the supplier locations to countries where the impact of the pandemic was low.\n\nFor many components, lead times increased significantly, leading to shortages. Market prices for raw materials showed extreme volatility, falling in the first half of the year and recovering from their lows from June onwards, led by a return to manufacturing growth in China. In general, in the second half of the year the economy continued its path to recovery, with manufacturing output and new orders both rising.\n\n## Supplier sustainability 3.5.3\n\nPhilips' purpose to improve people's lives applies throughout our value chain. An important area of focus for the Integrated Supply Chain is sustainability, and we are actively working on this together with our partners, be they suppliers or energy or logistics providers. Close cooperation with our suppliers not only helps us deliver health technology innovations, it also supports new approaches that help us minimize our environmental impact and maximize the social and economic value we create.\n\nSince 2003 we have dedicated supplier sustainability programs as part of our sustainability strategy. We have a direct (tier 1) business relationship with approximately 3,300 product and component suppliers and 16,000 service providers. In many cases, social issues deeper in our supply chain require us to intervene beyond tier 1 of the chain.\n\n## 3.5.2 Strategy and Businesses\n\nWe want to make a difference through sustainable supply management and responsible sourcing. This is more than simply managing compliance - it is about working together with our supply partners to have a positive and lasting impact. Therefore, the sustainability performance of our suppliers is fully embedded in our procurement organization and strategy.\n\nIn 2020, our focus was on further maximizing our positive impact on the supply chain. Through the Supplier Sustainability Performance program, we improved the lives of 302,000 workers in our supply chain. We also explored new ways to leverage the power of data in our sustainability engagements. Through new usecases, we are utilizing insights from machine learning to strengthen the efficacy and effectiveness of sustainability performance at our suppliers.\n\nDetailed information on our supplier sustainability programs is available in section Supplier indicators, starting on page 263 of this Annual Report.\n\nManaging our large and complex supply chain in a socially and environmentally responsible way requires a structured and innovative approach, while being transparent and engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders. In 2020, our programs focused specifically on improving suppliers' sustainability performance, responsible sourcing of minerals, and reducing the environmental footprint of our supply base.",

The much improved operational backbone ensured that we were able to meet fluctuating customer demand and enabled us to grow both sales and orders as well as improve operating cash flow to EUR 2.8 billion and the diluted EPS to EUR 1.31 per share.' '\n\nAbhijit Bhattacharya CFO Royal Philips\n\n## Performance review 4.1\n\n## The year 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Sales amounted to EUR 19.5 billion, in line with 2019 on a nominal basis. On a comparable basis *) , overall sales growth was 3%, with 22% growth in the Connected Care businesses, a 2% decline in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, and a 4% decline in the Personal Health businesses.\n- \u00b7 Net income amounted to EUR 1.2 billion, an increase of EUR 22 million compared to 2019, mainly due to lower net financial expenses and lower income tax expenses, partly offset by charges of EUR 144 million related to impairment of goodwill. Net income is not allocated to segments, as certain income and expense line items are recorded on a centralized basis.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA *) amounted to EUR 2.6 billion, or 13.2% of sales, in line with 2019. The productivity programs delivered annual savings of approximately EUR 447 million and included approximately EUR 222 million procurement savings, led by the Design for Excellence (DfX) program, and approximately EUR 225 million savings from other productivity programs. While the Connected Care businesses delivered improved profit expansion, both the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Personal Health businesses showed a decline in Adjusted EBITA *) margin. This was primarily due to lower volumes and resulting lower factory fixed cost coverage, an adverse mix impact due to lower sales in Ultrasound and Image-Guided Therapy in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, and the decline in sales, partly offset by cost savings, in the Personal Health businesses.\n- \u00b7 Operating cash flow amounted to EUR 2.8 billion, an increase of EUR 746 million, mainly due to working capital improvements, in particular better management of outstanding receivables. The 2019 figure was mainly\n\nattributable to higher earnings, partly offset by higher working capital outflows and higher tax paid. Free cash flow *) amounted to EUR 1.9 billion, compared to EUR 1.1 billion in 2019.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2020, Philips completed three acquisitions, with Intact Vascular, Inc. (Intact Vascular) being the most notable.\n- \u00b7 On January 29, 2019, Philips announced a new EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program for capital reduction purposes. As of the end of 2020, Philips had completed 50.3% of this program. Philips has executed the second half of the program through individual forward transactions with settlement dates extending into the second half of 2021.\n- \u00b7 In January 2020, Philips announced that it would review options for future ownership of its Domestic Appliances business, part of the Personal Health segment. Philips has started the process of creating a separate legal structure for this business within the Philips Group, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2021. Separation costs of EUR 42 million were incurred in 2020.\n\n## Coronavirus disease 2020 (COVID-19) outbreak\n\nIn 2020, COVID-19 affected the global economy and the company's results. In the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, comparable sales *) declined due to the postponement of installations and elective procedures resulting from the impact of COVID-19. In the Personal Health businesses, COVID-19 led to a decline in comparable sales *) due to lockdowns in several countries. The Connected Care businesses recorded comparable sales growth *) , as our innovations in both Monitoring & Analytics and Sleep & Respiratory Care were able to help our customers combat the pandemic.",

Expressed as a percentage of sales, this represented an increase to 55.0% of sales in 2020 from 54.4% of sales in 2019.\n\nCosts of materials used decreased by EUR 81 million, mainly due to procurement savings of EUR 222 million and a positive foreign currency impact. This was partly offset by higher volume.\n\nSalaries and wages in 2020 increased by EUR 51 million, driven by acquisitions and higher volume, partly offset by productivity measures.\n\nDepreciation and amortization in 2020 increased by EUR 50 million, mainly due to an impairment of a technology asset of EUR 92 million in 2020, compared to EUR 50 million in 2019.\n\nOther manufacturing costs increased by EUR 127 million in 2020, mainly due to a provision of EUR 38 million related to legal matters and charges of EUR 34 million due to changes in ventilator demand.\n\n## Gross margin\n\nIn 2020, Philips' gross margin was EUR 8,781 million, or 45.0% of sales, compared to EUR 8,875 million, or 45.6% of sales, in 2019. The year-on-year decrease in gross margin was mainly driven by a EUR 70 million decrease in IP royalty income, as well as lower coverage of fixed costs in our industrial base, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19.\n\n## Selling expenses\n\nSelling expenses amounted to EUR 4,606 million, or 23.6% of sales, in 2020, compared to EUR 4,682 million, or 24.0% of sales, in 2019. The year-on-year decrease in selling expenses of EUR 76 million was driven by savings from productivity improvements, a positive foreign currency impact and lower restructuring costs, partly offset by costs from new acquisitions. Selling expenses in 2020 include EUR 141 million of restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges, compared to EUR 158 million in 2019.\n\n## General and administrative expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 668 million, or 3.4% of sales, in 2020, compared to EUR 631 million, or 3.2% of sales, in 2019. The yearon-year increase of EUR 37 million in general and administrative expenses was mainly driven by charges related to the separation of the Domestic Appliances business of EUR 37 million. Higher restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges were largely offset by savings from productivity programs.\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nResearch and development costs were EUR 1,915 million, or 9,8% of sales, in 2020, compared to EUR 1,884 million, or 9.7% of sales, in 2019. The year-on-year increase of EUR 31 million was mainly driven by impairments of technology assets in the Connected Care businesses and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses totaling EUR 54 million, offset by lower restructuring and acquisition-related costs and other charges. 2020 includes EUR 132 million of restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges, compared to EUR 151 million in 2019.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Research and development expenses in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                       | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 801    | 928    | 891    |\n| Connected Care        | 424    | 465    | 550    |\n| Personal Health       | 300    | 302    | 293    |\n| Other                 | 235    | 189    | 181    |\n| Philips Group         | 1,759  | 1,884  | 1,915  |\n| As a % of sales       | 9.7%   | 9.7%   | 9.8%   |\n\n## Net income, Income from operations (EBIT) and Adjusted EBITA *)\n\nNet income is not allocated to segments, as certain income and expense line items are monitored on a centralized basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group level only.\n\nThe overview below shows Income from operations and Adjusted EBITA *) according to the 2020 segment classifications.",

The Adjusted EBITA *) in 2020 was EUR (145) million, compared to EUR (76) million in 2019.

For further information, refer to Financial income and expenses, starting on page 154.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes amounted to EUR 284 million. The effective income tax rate in 2020 was 19.0% compared to 22.1% in 2019, mainly due to one-off non-cash benefits from a decrease in tax rate, and higher non-taxable results from participations, partly offset by lower non-cash benefits from business integration, compared to 2019. For 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be within the 24%-26% range, depending on the geographical mix of taxable income.\n\n## Investment in associates\n\nResults related to investments in associates decreased from a gain of EUR 1 million in 2019 to a loss of EUR 9 million in 2020, as the majority of associates recorded a loss in 2020.",

Changes in debt mainly included the net proceeds from the Green Innovation Bond issued of EUR 744 million, partly offset by outflows related to bond maturity of EUR 500 million and lease payments.\n\n## Net cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Net cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                         | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities    | (15)   | (11)   | (88)   |\n| Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities    | 662    | (14)   |        |\n| Net cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations | 647    | (25)   | (88)   |\n\nIn 2020, net cash used for discontinued operations mainly related to advance income tax payments amounting to EUR 78 million for which Philips expects to get a refund.\n\nIn 2019, net cash used for discontinued operations consisted primarily of a divestment formerly reported as discontinued operations.\n\n## Financing 4.6\n\nCondensed consolidated balance sheets for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 are presented below:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Condensed consolidated balance sheets in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                           | 2018     | 2019     | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Intangible assets                                         | 12,093   | 12,120   | 11,012   |\n| Property, plant and equipment                             | 1,712    | 2,866    | 2,682    |\n| Inventories                                               | 2,674    | 2,773    | 2,993    |\n| Receivables                                               | 4,344    | 4,909    | 4,537    |\n| Assets classified as held for sale                        | 87       | 13       | 173      |\n| Other assets                                              | 3,421    | 2,910    | 3,091    |\n| Payables                                                  | (3,957)  | (3,820)  | (3,854)  |\n| Provisions                                                | (2,151)  | (2,159)  | (1,980)  |\n| Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale | (12)     | -        | (30)     |\n| Other liabilities                                         | (2,962)  | (2,965)  | (3,015)  |\n| Net asset employed                                        | 15,249   | 16,647   | 15,609   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                 | 1,688    | 1,425    | 3,226    |\n| Debt                                                      | (4,821)  | (5,447)  | (6,934)  |\n| Net debt 1)                                               | (3,132)  | (4,022)  | (3,708)  |\n| Non-controlling interests                                 | (29)     | (28)     | (31)     |\n| Shareholders' equity                                      | (12,088) | (12,597) | (11,870) |\n| Financing                                                 | (15,249) | (16,647) | (15,609) |",

New borrowings of long-term debt include the net proceeds of EUR 991 million from the issuance of two new bonds under the EMTN program in 2020. Repayments of long-term debt amounted to EUR 298 million, mainly due to the repayment of leases. Changes in payment obligations from forward contracts are mainly related to the forward contracts entered into of EUR 745 million to complete the remainder of the EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program announced on January 29, 2019. In addition, Philips entered into forward contracts of a total amount of EUR 174 million in 2020 related to the long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans announced on January 29, 2020, and a total amount of EUR 126 million of forward contracts matured relating to the company's long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans announced on October 22, 2018. These payment obligations are recorded as financial liabilities under long-term debt. Other changes, mainly resulting from currency effects, led to a decrease of EUR 221 million.\n\nIn 2019, total debt increased by EUR 626 million compared to 2018. Total debt at December 31, 2019 included additional lease liabilities of EUR 1,059 million which were recorded following the adoption of IFRS 16 lease accounting in 2019; this did not have a cash impact. New borrowings of long-term debt included the net proceeds from the issuance of the Green Innovation Bond of EUR 744 million. Repayments of long-term debt amounted to EUR 761 million, mainly due to the repayment of a EUR 500 million bond at its scheduled maturity. Changes in payment obligations from forward contracts were mainly related to maturing forward contracts for the completed 2017 share buyback program and the share repurchase program announced in November 2018. These payment obligations were recorded as financial liabilities under long-term and short-term debt. Other\n\nchanges, mainly resulting from currency effects, led to an increase of EUR 170 million.\n\nAt the end of 2020, long-term debt as a proportion of the total debt stood at 82.3% with an average remaining term (including current portion) of 6.3 years, compared to 91% and 8.0 years respectively at the end of 2019.\n\nAt the end of 2019, long-term debt as a proportion of the total debt stood at 91% with an average remaining term (including current portion) of 8.0 years, compared to 71% and 7.9 years respectively at the end of 2018.\n\nFor further information, please refer to Debt, starting on page 174.\n\n## Liquidity position 4.8\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, including the cash position (cash and cash equivalents), as well as its EUR 1 billion committed revolving credit facility, the Philips Group had access to available liquidity of EUR 4,226 million, versus gross debt (including short and long-term) of EUR 6,934 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, including the cash position (cash and cash equivalents), as well as its EUR 1 billion committed revolving credit facility, the Philips Group had access to available liquidity of EUR 2,425 million, versus gross debt (including short and long-term) of EUR 5,447 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, including the cash position (cash and cash equivalents), as well as its EUR 1 billion committed revolving credit facility, the Philips Group had access to available liquidity of EUR 2,688 million, versus gross debt (including short and long-term) of EUR 4,821 million.\n\n## Liquidity position in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                                  | 2018    | 2019    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | 1,688   | 1,425   | 3,226   |\n| Committed revolving credit facilities/CP program | 1,000   | 1,000   | 1,000   |\n| Liquidity                                        | 2,688   | 2,425   | 4,226   |\n| Listed equity investments at fair value          | 476     | 15      | 17      |\n| Short-term debt                                  | (1,394) | (508)   | (1,229) |\n| Long-term debt                                   | (3,427) | (4,939) | (5,705) |\n| Net available liquidity resources                | (1,656) | (3,007) | (2,691) |",

The facility can be used for general group purposes, such as a backstop of its Commercial Paper Program.\n\nThe Commercial Paper Program amounts to USD 2.5 billion, under which Philips can issue commercial paper up to 364 days in tenor, both in the US and in Europe, in any major freely convertible currency. As of December 31, 2020, Philips did not have any loans outstanding under these facilities.\n\nDuring the year 2020, Philips established a Euro Medium - Term Note (EMTN) program which facilitates the issuance of notes for a total amount of up to EUR 10.0 billion. As of December 31, 2020, Philips had issued bonds amounting to EUR 1 billion under the program.\n\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2020 Philips held EUR 17 million of listed (level 1) equity investments at fair value in common shares of companies in various industries. Refer to Other financial assets, starting on page 168 and Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 193.\n\nPhilips is exposed to several types of financial risks. In terms of liquidity risk, the company has taken a number of different measures to manage this risk, specifically with relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the successful placement of EUR 1,000 million fixed-rate notes in March (of which EUR 500 million Sustainability Innovation notes), the company also completed the remainder of the EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program that was announced on January 29, 2019 through individual forward contracts, with settlement dates extending into the second half of 2021. Furthermore, the 2019 Annual incentive of the Board of Management and the final dividend declared against the net income of 2019 were settled in shares instead of cash. Overall, the company has a solid liquidity position and the company's liquidity risk management procedures have not changed significantly because of COVID-19. No significant concentration risks have been identified as a result of COVID-19 and the company continues to have access to its existing lines of credit. These lines of credits, along with other financial risks to which Philips is exposed, are disclosed in Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 196.\n\nPhilips' existing long-term debt is rated A- (with stable outlook) by Fitch, Baa1 (with stable outlook) by Moody's, and BBB+ (with stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's. As part of our capital allocation policy, our net debt *) position is managed with the intention of retaining our current investment grade credit rating. Ratings are subject to change at any time and there is no assurance that Philips will be able to achieve this goal. Philips aim when managing the net debt *) position is dividend stability and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders *) . Philips' outstanding longterm debt and credit facilities do not contain financial covenants. Adverse changes\n\nin the company's ratings will not trigger automatic withdrawal of committed credit facilities or any acceleration in the outstanding long-term debt (provided that the USD-denominated bonds issued by Philips in March 2008 and 2012 contain a 'Change of Control Triggering Event' and the EUR-denominated bonds contain a 'Change of Control Put Event'). A description of Philips' credit facilities can be found in Debt, starting on page 174.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Credit rating summary\n\n|                   | long-term   | short-term   | outlook   |\n|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Fitch             | A-          |              | Stable    |\n| Moody's           | Baa1        | P-2          | Stable    |\n| Standard & Poor's | BBB+        | A-2          | Stable    |\n\nPhilips pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible. Cash not pooled remains available for local operational needs or general purposes. The company faces cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions in a few countries which could limit its ability to make these balances available on short notice for general use by the group.\n\nPhilips believes its current liquidity and direct access to capital markets is sufficient to meet its present financing needs.\n\n## Shareholders' equity 4.9\n\nIn 2020, shareholders' equity decreased by EUR 727 million to EUR 11,870 million at year-end. The increase in the net income of EUR 1,195 million, as well as the impact of the accounting for share-based compensation plans, including the effect of related hedging transactions through share call options (in aggregate EUR 112 million) increased shareholders' equity. This was largely offset by currency translation losses of EUR 1,037 million, primarily, due to the depreciation of the US dollar against the Euro in 2020, the purchase of forward contracts for the completion of the share buyback program (EUR 793 million), settlements of earlier concluded forward contracts (EUR 126 million) and the share repurchases made in the open market (EUR 130 million).\n\nShareholders' equity increased by EUR 509 million in 2019 to EUR 12,597 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to net results of EUR 1,173 million, the positive impact of currency translation differences of EUR 239 million,",

This was mainly offset by acquired shares because of settlements of earlier concluded forward transactions of EUR 706 million, share repurchases made in the open market of EUR 621 million, and dividend payments to shareholders of Royal Philips of EUR 453 million (including tax and service charges).\n\n## Share capital structure\n\nThe number of issued common shares of Royal Philips at December 31, 2020 was 911,053,001. At year-end 2020, the company held 5.9 million shares in treasury. All of these shares were held in treasury to cover obligations under long-term incentive plans. In 2016, Philips purchased call options on its own shares to hedge options granted to employees up to 2013, and on December 31, 2020, Philips' outstanding options related to 0.9 million shares. In 2020 (and earlier years), the company entered into several forward contracts to acquire its own shares, and on December 31, 2020, the outstanding forward contracts related to 27 million shares. See below for more information on the shares that were acquired in the course of 2020. Philips issued 48,757 shares in May 2020 (in order to pay out the gross Annual Incentive over 2019 to the members of the Board of Management) and issued 18 million shares in July 2020 (in order to distribute the 2019 dividend). The company cancelled 3.8 million shares in June 2020.\n\nThe number of issued common shares of Royal Philips at December 31, 2019 was 896,733,721. At year-end 2019, the company held 5.8 million shares in treasury. Of these shares, 5.3 million shares were held in treasury to cover obligations under long-term incentive plans, and 0.5 million shares were held for share capital reduction purposes. Philips repurchased and acquired shares in the course of the year, and cancelled 30 million shares in June 2019 and 8.5 million shares in December 2019. In 2016, Philips purchased call options on its own shares to hedge options granted to employees up to 2013. As of December 31, 2019, the company held 2.3 million of such options. In 2017 and 2018, Philips entered into several forward contracts in order to cover obligations under its long-term incentive plans, as well as to reduce its share capital. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding forward contracts related to 6 million shares.\n\n## Share repurchase methods for long-term incentive plans and capital reduction purposes\n\nPhilips uses different methods to repurchase shares in its own capital: (i) share buyback repurchases in the open market via an intermediary; (ii) repurchase of shares via forward contracts for future delivery of shares; and (iii) the unwinding of call options on own shares. During 2020, Philips used methods (i) and (ii) to repurchase shares for capital reduction purposes and methods (ii) and (iii) to repurchase shares for share-based compensation plans.\n\nThe open market transactions via an intermediary allow for buybacks during both open and closed periods.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Impact of share repurchase on share count in thousands of shares as of December 31\n\n|                    | 2016    | 2017    | 2018    | 2019    | 2020    |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Shares issued      | 929,645 | 940,909 | 926,196 | 896,734 | 911,053 |\n| Shares in treasury | 7,208   | 14,717  | 12,011  | 5,760   | 5,925   |\n| Shares outstanding | 922,437 | 926,192 | 914,184 | 890,974 | 905,128 |\n| Shares repurchased | 25,193  | 19,842  | 31,994  | 40,390  | 8,670   |\n| Shares cancelled   | 18,830  |         | 24,247  | 38,541  | 3,810   |",

In compliance with the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Amsterdam, the dividend record date will be May 11, 2021.\n\nShareholders will be given the opportunity to make their choice between cash and shares between May 12 and June 4, 2021. If no choice is made during this election period, the dividend will be paid in cash. The number of share dividend rights entitled to one new common share will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price of all traded common shares Koninklijke Philips N.V. at Euronext Amsterdam on June 2, 3 and 4, 2021. The company will calculate the number of share dividend rights entitled to one new common share (the ratio), such that the gross dividend in shares will be approximately equal to the gross dividend in cash. The ratio and the number of shares to be issued will be announced on June 8, 2021. Payment of the dividend (up to EUR 775 million) and delivery of new common shares, with settlement of fractions in cash, if required, will take place from June 9, 2021.

The proposed distribution and all dates mentioned remain provisional until then.\n\nDividend in cash is in principle subject to 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax, which will be deducted from the dividend in cash paid to the shareholders. Dividend in shares paid out of net income and retained earnings is subject to 15% dividend withholding tax, but only in respect of the par value of the shares (EUR 0.20 per share). Shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisor on the applicable situation with respect to taxes on the dividend received.\n\nIn 2020, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, representing a total value of EUR 758 million including costs. Shareholders received the dividend in shares only, resulting in the issuance of 18,080,198 new common shares,\n\nleading to a 2.0% dilution. The dilution caused by the newly issued dividend shares was partially offset by the cancellation of 3,809,675 shares in June 2020. No cash dividend settlement took place in 2020. On March 23, 2020 Philips announced that the remainder of the EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program would be executed through forward purchases. The delivery of 20,476,023 shares purchased through forward contracts will take place from June 23, 2021 to December 20, 2021.

        "page_content": "## Environmental, Social and Governance 5\n\nEnvironmental, Social & Governance (ESG) are the three key dimensions within which a company's approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably, and its overall societal impact, are defined. They give expression to an increasingly widely held view - that companies that hold themselves accountable to their stakeholders and increase transparency will be more viable, and valuable, in the long term.\n\nPhilips is a purpose-driven company aiming to improve the health and well-being of 2.5 billion people annually by 2030. We believe that private-sector companies like ours have a vital role to play in collaborating with other partners across our supply chain, and with private and public organizations in society, to address the major challenges the world is facing.\n\nTaking a multi-stakeholder approach, we draw inspiration from the societal impact we can have through our products and solutions, and through how we operate in the world. Our company is very conscious of our responsibility and our contribution to society and the environment.\n\nAs of this Annual Report 2020, we have chosen to align our reporting with the comprehensive and integrated Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) commitments we introduced for the period 2020-2025, with the aim of better integrating and further raising performance on the three dimensions of ESG.\n\n## ESG reporting framework 5.1\n\nThere is not yet a single objective standard for measurement of ESG performance. Building on our long history and experience of environmental and social impact measurement and of providing transparency on governance, Philips has taken an active role - in collaboration with various organizations - to help drive the evolution towards a standard ESG reporting framework.\n\nIn 2007, Philips signed up to the United Nations Global Compact, to advance ten universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anticorruption. In 2017, at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos, we signed the Compact for Responsive and Responsible Leadership - an initiative (initiated by WEF and Philips) to promote and align the long-term sustainability of corporations and the long-term goals of society, with an inclusive approach for all stakeholders. The WEF secured a commitment from over 140 CEOs to align their\n\ncorporate values and strategies with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAt the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in January 2020, the WEF's International Business Council (IBC) launched a project to define common metrics for sustainable value creation, the aim being to improve the ways that companies measure and report on their contributions towards more prosperous, fulfilled societies and a more sustainable relationship with the planet.\n\nIn September 2020, the IBC published its core set of Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and disclosures. These can be used by companies to align their mainstream reporting on performance against environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators and track their contributions towards the SDGs on a consistent basis. Based where possible on existing standards, the full set is comprised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Core metrics: A set of 21 more-established or critically important metrics and disclosures that focus primarily on activities within an organization's own boundaries.\n- \u00b7 Expanded metrics: A set of 34 metrics and disclosures that tend to be less well-established in existing practice and have a wider value chain scope or convey impact in a more sophisticated or tangible way, e.g. in monetary terms.\n\nThe recommended metrics are organized under four pillars that are aligned with the SDGs and principal ESG domains: Principles of Governance, Planet, People and Prosperity. There is no intention to replace industry- or company-specific metrics (like our Lives Improved metric). Companies are encouraged to report against as many of the core and expanded metrics as they find material and appropriate, on the basis of 'disclose or explain'.\n\nPhilips is also contributing to the IFRS Foundation's endeavors to drive standardization of non-financial reporting.\n\nIn section 5.6 of this Annual Report 2020, we show how Philips performed in 2020 on the above-mentioned 21 Core metrics, mapped to the three dimensions of our ESG commitments, as well as a number of additional Philips-specific metrics that we consider fundamental to the strategy and operation of our business.",

The program addressed both social and environmental challenges and included associated targets. On September 14, 2020 we launched our ESG commitments, with ambitious targets to be achieved by the end of 2025.\n\nBesides our social impact, focusing on SDG 3, described in the next section, we have an environmental impact through our global operations, but even more so through our products and solutions. This is where we contribute to SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and SDG 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\nIn this Environmental performance section, an overview is given of the most important environmental parameters of the Healthy people, Sustainable planet program. Details can be found in the Sustainability statements, starting on page 244.\n\n## Environmental impact\n\nSince 1990, Philips has been performing Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs). These LCAs provide insight into the lifetime environmental impact of our products and are used to steer our EcoDesign efforts and to grow our Green and Circular Solutions portfolio. As a logical next step, we have measured our environmental impact on society at large via a so-called Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account, which includes the hidden environmental costs associated with our activities and products. It provides insights into the main environmental hotspots and innovation areas to reduce the environmental impact of our products and solutions.\n\nThe EP&L account is based on LCA methodology, in which the environmental impacts are expressed in monetary terms using conversion factors developed by CE Delft. These conversion factors are subject to further refinement and are expected to change over time. We used expert opinions and estimates for some parts of the calculations. The figures reported are Philips' best possible estimates. As we gain new insights and retrieve more and better data, we will enhance the methodology, use-cases and accuracy of results in the future. For more information we refer to our methodology document.\n\nAn important learning that we derived from the 2017-2019 EP&L is that, in addition to the conversion factors, the definition of the use-case scenarios also has a significant impact on the result. This is especially true of consumer products, which have large sales volumes, long lifetimes and frequently high energy consumption (e.g. haircare products and steam irons). Based on new consumer insights, we have changed use-case scenarios, and reduced, for example, the maximum wattage used and/or the daily duration of use. This resulted in a\n\nmaterial reduction of EUR 1.16 billion on the EP&L in 2020 (and 1.74 billion on the EP&L in 2019).\n\nOther changes we made to improve the accuracy of our environmental impact are the inclusion of our full Sleep & Respiratory Care portfolio (resulting in 13% additional impact compared to the 2019 result) and the differentiation of the energy mix of the use-phase of our products based on the region of sales. The 2020 impact would have been EUR 150 million higher if we had still used the global average energy mix for all products regardless of where the products are used.\n\nFor comparability reasons, we have also applied the new use-cases and additional Sleep & Respiratory Care products to the 2019 EP&L. The table below shows this refined EP&L impact based on 2019 sales volumes.\n\nPhilips Group\n\n## EP&L refinement in billions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n| Original EP&L 2019                                  |   7.25 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Changes reference products Addition of full Sleep & |   0.57 |\n| Refined EP&L 2019                                   |   6.08 |\n\nThe current EP&L account only includes the hidden environmental costs. It does not yet include the benefits to society that Philips generates by improving people's health and well-being through our products and solutions. We have a well-established methodology to calculate the number of lives we positively touch with our products and solutions. We aim to look into valuing these societal benefits in monetary terms as well and include them in our future EP&L account.\n\n## Results 2020\n\nIn 2020, Philips' environmental impact amounted to EUR 4.91 billion, compared to EUR 6.08 billion in 2019 (refined from EUR 7.25 billion due to the updated usecase scenarios and addition of the full Sleep & Respiratory Care portfolio). This significant reduction was mainly driven by lower unit sales in Personal Health and by our EcoDesign efforts resulting in more energy-efficient products. The main environmental impact, 83% of the total, is related to the usage of our products, which is due to electricity consumption. Particulate matter formation, climate change, and acidification are the main environmental impacts, accounting for 43%, 27% and 18% respectively of the total impact. The environmental costs include the environmental impact of the full lifetime of the products that we put on the market in 2020, e.g. 10 years in the case of a medical system or 7 years of usage in",

As we grow our portfolio of Green Products and Solutions, we expect the environmental impact to reduce.\n\nOf the total 2020 impact, just EUR 135 million (3%) is directly caused by Philips' own operations, mainly driven by outbound logistics. Compared to EUR 154 million in 2019, this is an 12% reduction, mainly due to reduced business travel (COVID-19) as well as an increased share of green electricity in our non-industrial sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur supply chain currently has an environmental impact of some EUR 693 million, which is 14% of our total environmental impact.

As a next step in our journey to reduce our environmental impact, and part of our ESG commitments launched in September 2020, we committed to reduce our full value chain emissions in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C global warming scenario,\n\n## Green Innovation 5.3.1\n\nAccording to research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research, over 4% of global CO2 emissions are caused by the Healthcare sector. Our Green Innovation - the Research & Development spend related to the development of new generations of Green Products and Solutions and Green Technologies, addressing SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) - is focused on addressing that impact.\n\nSustainable Innovation is the Research & Development spend related to the development of new generations of products and solutions that address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) or 12. With regard to Sustainable Innovation spend, Philips set a target of EUR 7.5 billion (cumulative) for the period 2016-2020 as part of the Healthy people, Sustainable planet program.\n\nIn 2020, Philips invested EUR 280 million in Green Innovation and some EUR 1.7 billion in Sustainable Innovation. Total Sustainable Innovation spend over the past five years amounted to EUR 7.4 billion, about 1% below the target.",

Investments in Green Innovation in 2020 amounted to EUR 122 million, a significant increase compared to 2019.\n\nAll Philips Green Focal Areas are taken into account as we aim to reduce environmental impact over the total lifecycle. Energy efficiency is an area of focus, especially for our large imaging systems such as MRI. Philips also pays particular attention to enabling the upgrading of pathways, so our customers can benefit from enhancements in workflow, dose management and imaging quality with the equipment they already own. Our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses actively support a voluntary industry initiative with European trade association COCIR to improve the energy efficiency and material efficiency of medical imaging equipment, as well as lowering its hazardous substances content. Moreover, we are actively partnering with multiple leading care providers to investigate innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of healthcare, for example by maximizing energy-efficient use of medical equipment and optimizing lifecycle value. Additionally, Philips aimed to close the loop on all large medical equipment\n\nthat became available to us by the end of 2020, and to extend circular practices to all medical equipment by 2025. To achieve this target, we actively drive tradeins in markets where de-install, trade-in and reverse logistics capabilities are in place, and build these capabilities in countries that do not yet have them.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nPhilips' connected health IT solutions integrate, collect, combine and deliver quality data for actionable insights to help improve access to quality care, while respecting the limits of natural resources. It is our belief that well-designed ehealth solutions can reduce the travel-related carbon footprint of healthcare, increase efficiency in hospitals, and improve access to care and outcomes. This has also become apparent during the COVID-19 crisis. Green Innovation investments in 2020 amounted to EUR 51 million, a sizeable increase compared to 2019, and Green Innovation projects in 2020 delivered, among other things, new green patient monitors with lower environmental footprints, reflecting all the Philips Green Focal Areas. Energy efficiency and material reduction are the main areas of focus.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nThe continued high level of R&D investments at our Personal Health businesses is also reflected in the Green Innovation spend, which amounted to EUR 105 million in 2020, compared with EUR 99 million in 2019. The Personal Health businesses continued their work on improving the energy efficiency of their products, closing the materials loop (e.g. by using recycled materials in products and packaging), and the voluntary phase-out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFR), Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates from, among others, food contact products. Mother & Child Care introduced a reusable sterilization box for soothers and breastfeeding accessories, eliminating the need for separate packaging. In our Oral Healthcare portfolio, we have been able to achieve a 40% average packaging reduction for the Protective Clean products for US retail. In our Garment Care portfolio, we launched our first green optimal-temperature pressurized steam generator; this energy-efficient product contains recycled plastic and is free of PVC and BFR.\n\n## Other\n\nThe segment Other invested EUR 2 million in Green Innovation, spread over projects focused on global challenges relating to water, air, energy, food, circular economy, and access to affordable healthcare.\n\n## Circular economy\n\nFor a sustainable world, the transition from a linear to a circular economy is essential. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using these resources more effectively. It is a driver of innovation in the areas of material, component and product re-use, as well as new business models such as system solutions and services. At Philips, we",

In 2016, as we launched our Healthy people, Sustainable planet program, we aimed, among other things, to generate 15% of our revenues from circular products and services, and to send zero waste to landfill in our own operations, by 2020. At the beginning of 2018, we added a pledge to take back and repurpose all the large medical systems equipment (e.g. MRI and CT scanners) that our customers are prepared to return to us, and to extend those practices across our professional portfolio by 2025. At the end of 2020, we had achieved these ambitious circular economy goals.\n\nFor more information on our Circular Economy activities and the progress towards targets in 2020, please refer to Circular Economy, starting on page 251.\n\n## Green Revenues 5.3.2\n\nGreen Revenues are generated through products and solutions that offer a significant environmental improvement in one or more Green Focal Areas - Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight, Circularity, and Lifetime reliability - and thereby deliver a contribution to SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ). Green Revenues increased to EUR 13.9 billion in 2020, or 71.0 % of sales (67.2% in 2019), reaching a record level for Philips and exceeding the 2020 target of 70%.\n\nGreen Revenues per segment in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated Philips Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough our EcoDesign process we aim to create products and solutions that have significantly less impact on the environment over their whole lifecycle. Overall, the most significant improvements have been in energy efficiency, although increased attention was also given to hazardous substances and recyclability in all segments in 2020, the latter driven by our Circular Economy initiatives.\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nIn 2020, our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses expanded their Green Products and Solutions portfolio with new Green Products - the CT Incisive, Mobile X-Ray system Zenition 50 and 70 - and with redesigns of various Green Products offering further environmental improvements such as the MR Ambition and Elition systems. These products improve patient outcomes, provide better value, and enable access to high-quality care, while reducing environmental impact. A good example is BlueSeal magnet technology, which is designed to reduce lengthy and costly disruptions in MRI practice for the MR Ambition, and help healthcare facilities transition to more productive and sustainable, almost helium-free operations. The new Green Products offer an improvement of over 10% in at least one of the Green Focal Areas compared to their predecessor products, e.g. 12-13%",

Recently launched VS30 and MX850 patient monitors, EV300 and EVO ventilators and the Intrepid HeartStart monitor & defibrillator came onto the market with over 10% lower energy usage and/or product weight compared to their predecessor products. For example, energy savings for the EVO and EV300 ventilators were around 25% compared to their predecessor Trilogy 100 and 202 products.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nIn our Personal Health businesses, the focus is on Green Products and Solutions that meet or exceed our minimum requirements in the areas of energy consumption, packaging, substances of concern, and application of recycled plastics. Green Revenues in 2020 advanced to 72% of total sales, compared to 63% in 2019. We continue to make progress in developing PVC/BFR-free products. More than 84% of our consumer product sales consist of PVC/BFR-free products, with the exception of power cords, for which there are not yet economically viable alternatives available. In our coffee portfolio we launched the Senseo Viva Caf\u00e9 Eco, with over 75% recycled content in non-food-contact plastic parts. in our Kitchen Appliances portfolio, we stepped up the application of recycled plastic for our Eole and Viva/Bond Airfryers, switching over from virgin plastic to recycled plastic for the internal housing parts.\n\n## Sustainable Operations 5.3.3\n\nPhilips' Sustainable Operations programs focus on the main contributors to climate change, recycling of waste, reduction of water consumption, and reduction of emissions.\n\nFull details can be found in Sustainability statements, starting on page 244.\n\n## Carbon footprint and energy efficiency\n\nAt Philips, we see climate change as a serious threat. Therefore, we are taking action to rethink our business models and decouple economic growth from the impact we have on the environment. We believe large corporates should lead the transition to a low-carbon economy. This will not only benefit the environment, but will also positively impact social and economic aspects.\n\nDuring the COP 21 United Nations Climate Conference in Paris in 2015, we committed to become carbon-neutral in our operations, pursue all efforts to reduce our operational emissions, source all our electricity from 100% renewable sources, and to offset all unavoidable emissions by year-end 2020. We are proud to confirm that as of 2020, Philips is carbon-neutral in its operations. We delivered\n\non this commitment as a result of a comprehensive program that included energy-efficiency improvements, on-site renewables, Power Purchase Agreements, but also business travel reduction and transport mode shifts to lowcarbon emitting alternatives, and finally a carbon offset program.\n\nWe are proud that our efforts are acknowledged by the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), a global NGO that assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance and management of reporting companies. In 2020, we were ranked on the CDP Climate Change 'A' List for our continued climate performance and transparency for the eighth year in a row.\n\nHaving achieved our 2020 carbon neutrality target, we have raised the bar and set ambitious emission reduction targets to ensure we help limit the impact of global warming, not only in our operations, but throughout our value chain collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact. That is why Philips has set new long-term emission reduction targets, which have been assessed and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) - locking down our commitment to drive climate action across the value chain and ensuring that we contribute to the decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase well below 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nIn 2020, our net operational carbon footprint resulted in zero kilotonnes carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-e), mainly driven by increased use of electricity from renewable sources, a significant reduction in air travel due to COVID-19, and a reduction in air freight, notwithstanding emergency flights with respiratory and other equipment for hospitals during the COVID-19 crisis. A total of 535 kilotonnes carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-e) were compensated via carbon offsets.\n\nPhilips reports all its emissions in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) as further described in Scope, starting on page 248.",

This excludes the acquired carbon offsets.\n\nIn our sites we achieved significant reductions in our scope 2 (indirect) emissions, mainly driven by an increase in global renewable electricity share from 95% in 2019 to 100% in 2020. All our US operations were already powered by renewable electricity from the Los Mirasoles wind farm. Then, in 2019, the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland, with which we closed long-term contracts through our renewable electricity purchasing consortium with Nouryon, DSM and Google, powered all our operations in the Netherlands. Combined with the Los Mirasoles wind farm, this covers some 50% of our total electricity demand. Combined with the achieved energy reductions, this led to a 28% reduction in emissions from our energy consumption (scope 1 and scope 2 market-based) in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nIn December 2020, Philips announced its next Power Purchase Agreement, again in a purchasing consortium with Heineken, Nouryon and Signify, to power most of the remaining European sites with renewable electricity.\n\nOur business travel emissions, covering emissions from air travel, lease cars and rental cars, decreased by 54% compared to 2019. We recorded a 78% reduction in our air travel emissions, mainly as a result of COVID-19 and our 'Travel less, travel smarter' campaign. This campaign was initiated to further reduce our business travel emissions by installing more online collaboration rooms as an alternative to travel, stimulating behavioral change via our Global Connect Challenge, and promoting alternative modes of transport. In addition to the emission reduction in air travel, emissions from our lease car fleet decreased by 11%, mainly due to COVID-19 and the working-from-home protocol, partially mitigated by an increase in fleet size. Emissions resulting from rental cars decreased by 54% compared to 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we recorded a 15% decrease in emissions in our overall logistics operations compared to 2019. We reduced overall emissions from air freight by 6%. Emissions from ocean freight reduced by 47%, mainly as a result of improved data insights, allowing us to more accurately quantify our ocean freight emissions. Emissions from parcel shipments decreased by 1% as we shipped more parcels, but over a shorter distance compared to previous years. Emissions from road transport decreased by 12%, mainly driven by a decreased demand for Personal Health products in the first half year of 2020. We continued to make transport mode shifts to low-carbon alternatives, but departed from this while addressing the significant and urgent increase in demand for respiratory and other healthcare equipment during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAlthough reduction is key to achieving carbon neutrality, unavoidable carbon emissions required offsetting in order to gradually drive down our emissions to zero by year-end 2020. We did this by financing projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) and 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ). In 2020, we increased offsets to 535 kilotonnes, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 16 million mediumsized oak trees. This covers the total emissions of our entire operations, covering all sites, all business travel and all logistics flows. We do this by financing carbon reduction projects in emerging regions that drive social, economic and additional environmental progress for the local communities, such as:\n\n## Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption\n\nThese carbon-emission reduction projects will provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and Ethiopia and will reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard.",

However, a number of our manufacturing sites are located in water-stressed regions in, for example, India. Total water intake in 2020 was 777,476 m 3 , a 13% reduction compared to 2019. The government-mandated lockdowns and the working-from-home protocol resulted in a significant reduction in water intake at several sites. Personal Health, which consumes 48% of total water usage, recorded a 16% decrease. The decrease was mainly due to fewer employees working on the sites and production volume decreases at water-intensive manufacturing sites in Asia. Diagnosis & Treatment showed a decrease of 3%, mainly caused by the working-from-home protocol, partially mitigated by the installation of a water-intense technology on a site in North America.

The level of emissions of hazardous substances decreased from 2,521 kilos in 2019 to 616 kilos in 2020 (-76%), mainly driven by the significant reduction in styrene emissions in the Personal Health businesses.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Restricted and hazardous substances in kilos\n\n|                       | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   |   2020 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Restricted substances | 1      | 0      | 0      | 0      |      0 |\n| Hazardous substances  | 10,496 | 5,243  | 3,363  | 2,521  |    616 |\n\nFor more details on emissions from substances, please refer to Sustainable Operations, starting on page 254.",

As such, we focus on our Workforce of the Future and our deep commitment to Inclusion & Diversity, supported by our culture.\n\n## Improving people's lives 5.4.1\n\nAt Philips, it is our purpose to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation. We aim to improve the lives of 2.5 billion people a year by 2030.\n\nTo guide our efforts and measure our progress, we take an integrated approach. Products or solutions from our portfolio that directly support the curative or preventive side of people's health determine the contribution to the social dimension. This is also our contribution to UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ). As healthy ecosystems are also needed for people to live a healthy life, the contribution to the ecological dimension is determined by means of our steadily growing Green Products and Solutions portfolio, such as the energy-efficient products in our Personal Health businesses. This is our contribution to Sustainable Development Goal 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and SDG 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\nPhilips improved 1.75 billion lives in 2020, an increase of around 110 million compared to 2019, driven by all segments, mainly in China, the ASEAN countries, North America and the Indian Subcontinent. Through Philips products and solutions that support people's health and well-being, we improved the lives of 1.53 billion people in 2020 (2019: 1.54 billion), mainly driven by Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Connected Care businesses. Our Green Products and Solutions that support a healthy ecosystem contributed 1.19 billion lives (2019: 1.07 billion). After the elimination of double counts - people touched multiple times we arrived at 1.75 billion lives improved.\n\nIn 2019, Philips extended its commitment to improve the lives of people in underserved communities to 400 million by 2030. Philips thereby recognized the often critical needs of women and children in many communities, but also the added burden arising from the increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in communities already struggling without adequate access to healthcare. To monitor progress on this extended commitment, we track lives improved in underserved communities. In 2020 our health and well-being solutions improved the lives of 207 million people in underserved markets (an increase of 13 million compared to 2019).\n\nFollowing the launch of our ESG commitments in September 2020, we will also change the definition of Lives Improved with effect from 2021, to be aligned with our purpose. The new definition will only include products or solutions that contribute to people's health and well-being.\n\n## Lives Improved per market\n\nThe following table shows the number of Lives Improved per market.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Lives improved per market\n\n| Market                         |   Lives Improved (million) 1) | Population (million) 2)   | Saturation rate (as % of population)   | GDP (USD million) 3)   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Africa                         |                            34 | 1,234                     | 3%                                     | 2,335                  |\n| ASEAN & Pacific                |                           172 | 966                       | 18%                                    | 6,580                  |\n| Benelux                        |                            27 | 29                        | 93%                                    | 1,458                  |\n| Central & Eastern Europe       |                            82 | 162                       | 51%                                    | 1,874                  |\n| Germany, Austria & Switzerland |                            83 | 101                       | 82%                                    | 4,928                  |\n| France                         |                            47 | 68                        | 69%                                    | 2,626                  |\n| Greater China                  |                           471 | 1,436                     | 33%                                    | 15,801                 |\n| Iberia                         |                            31 | 57                        | 54%                                    | 1,474                  |\n| Indian Subcontinent            |                            88 | 1,601                     | 5%                                     | 3,026                  |\n| Italy, Israel & Greece         |                            40 | 82                        | 49%                                    | 2,465                  |\n| Japan                          |                            45 | 126                       | 36%                                    | 4,911                  |\n| Latin America                  |                           101 | 639                       | 16%                                    | 4,388                  |\n| Middle East & Turkey           |                            74 | 379                       | 20%                                    | 2,962                  |\n| Nordics                        |                            19 | 28                        | 68%                                    | 1,530                  |\n| North America                  |                           354 | 368                       | 96%                                    | 22,408                 |\n| Russia & Central Asia          |                            48 | 251                       | 19%                                    | 1,895                  |\n| UK & Ireland                   |                            36 | 72                        | 50%                                    | 3,052                  |",

Our focus on the Workforce of the Future helps us to attract, develop and retain a workforce that will deliver the strategic capabilities we need to win.\n\nBy applying Strategic Workforce Planning, in close alignment with the strategic planning of our businesses, we identify and develop the employee capabilities needed to realize our ambitions as a health technology company. In 2020 we implemented company-wide initiatives to retain and staff our most strategic positions with top performers. At the end of 2020 we had retained 94% of these employees and staffed 49% of our strategic positions with employees who are considered to be top performers. Key drivers of this are our internal development focus, leadership programs and our focused talent search services.\n\nWe have continued to embed our Total Workforce Strategy - looking at all sources, channels and locations for skills and capabilities, including employees, contingent workers, freelancers and services. Talent Acquisition has deployed our Right Shoring & Right Sourcing methodology into every business segment and multiple functions. In addition, we are now attracting 42% of our freelancers via our Careers site and building talent pools in US, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nWe continued to devote additional attention to our campus, graduate and earlycareer hiring in 2020, which resulted in an increase of 29% in the number of campus hires compared to 2019, despite the impact of the pandemic. Our focus on the Workforce of the Future continues in 2021, with emphasis on strategic capabilities.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity 5.4.3\n\nTo be able to understand and meet customer and patient needs in a complex and continually changing environment, our workforce should reflect the society in which we operate, our customers, and the markets we serve. We believe that an inclusive culture allows our 120-plus nationalities to bring a rich diversity of capabilities, opinions and perspectives to our decision-making processes, thus driving innovation, enabling faster, targeted responses to market changes, and supporting sustainable improvements in team- and business performance.\n\nDriving Inclusion & Diversity, Philips has set a new goal of 30% gender diversity in senior leadership positions (a subset of Management and Executive positions) by the end of 2025, up from the 2020 target of 25% that we met before the end of 2020. This is part of our reinforced commitments as a purpose-driven company. A company-wide training on unconscious bias awareness is part of the long-term program to create an ongoing dialogue in teams that will help us build and foster that inclusive environment.\n\nPhilips has also deployed a range of programs to support the health and wellbeing of its employees, including a global employee assistance program aimed at helping employees with urgent needs. When COVID-19 emerged, Philips provided support in this area without losing sight of longer-term needs, such as a healthy work-life balance, stress management, resilience and prevention of mental health issues.\n\nWith regard to appointment and promotion opportunities, we transparently share open positions and endeavor to attract candidates from a diverse range of backgrounds, resulting in a 50/50 hiring ratio when we recruit externally. We increased the number of women in senior positions for the third consecutive year.\n\nOur Inclusion & Diversity scores steadily increased to 39% at year-end, surpassing the global high-performance levels for the first time in the last two years. The number of awards won in 2020 - including appearances on Forbes Best Employers lists for both Women and Diversity, and Financial Times Diversity Leader 2021 - reflect the progress Philips has made in this important area.",

Philips employed 27% females in leadership positions, exceeding our 2020 goal of 25% gender diversity in leadership positions.\n\n## Our culture 5.4.4\n\nAs we continue our transformation into a focused leader in health technology shifting from products to solutions and building long-term relationships with our customers - we foster a culture within Philips that will help us achieve operational excellence and extend our solutions capability to address our customers' unmet needs.\n\nAll Philips employees are expected to commit to living our behaviors - Customers first, Quality and integrity always, Team up to win, Take ownership to deliver fast, and Eager to improve and inspire - every step of the way.\n\nPutting our customers first is at the heart of everything we do. Only by engaging deeply with our customers can we understand their unmet needs and deliver superior value. We are also conscious at all times of the high-stakes environment in which we operate. This environment demands that we apply the highest quality and integrity standards - always. To deliver superior value to our customers and ensure quality and integrity, we team up and leverage the skills, capabilities and expertise right across Philips. At the same time, we all need to take personal ownership, enabling us to move with speed and agility, and deliver what we promise, on time. And by applying operational excellence and Lean ways of working, we will keep improving, inspiring each other through the work we do.\n\nWe staff our positions based on assessed behavior, potential and capabilities. In 2020, we filled 74% of our Director-level and more senior positions from within the company. For these internal hires, we ensure our candidates are high performers with strong potential. In 2020, 84% of all internal promotions to Director level and more senior positions were realized by appointing top performers. We supplement this internal growth with targeted external hiring, bringing in employees with the behaviors and capabilities we require for our Workforce of the Future.\n\n## Employee engagement 5.4.5\n\nIn times like these, with the pandemic continuing to impact our lives, it is key that our people feel connected and actively listen to each other. High employee engagement is pivotal to the success of our strategy. Our employee survey consistently reports that our employee engagement is on the rise and well exceeding the global high-performance norm of 71%. Our average engagement score for 2020 was 79%, driven by our people feeling proud to live our company purpose, being optimistic about the future of Philips, and energized to contribute with their work.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Employee Engagement index\n\n|             | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Favorable   | 74%    | 74%    | 79%    |\n| Neutral     | 17%    | 17%    | 14%    |\n| Unfavorable | 9%     | 9%     | 7%     |\n\nOur quarterly employee surveys help to keep our finger on the pulse of employee sentiment toward the company. We listen to employees' ideas for improvement, show employees that their feedback is valued, and work to ensure that every person in our company has a role to play in creating lasting value for our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nAt Philips, we believe we perform at our best when we feel connected and supported. In these extraordinary circumstances in 2020, we listened actively to our employees to provide them with greater clarity of direction and increased autonomy and flexibility to deal with various work situations. Moreover, we strengthened our Health & Well-being programs, which are designed to engage our employees, help them to adopt a healthier lifestyle, and achieve a better work/life balance.",

As part of the Certification, we make an Action Plan to concentrate on areas for development and continue to conduct yearly pay gap assessments, by using a regression analysis and systematically checking the need for corrective measures. For Philips to be continually certified, we have to show tangible evidence that we have completed our Action Plan, and make further improvements on our focus areas that are brought to the surface by the Gender Equality audit.",

To this end, we conducted a living wage analysis on the lowest salaries in every country in which we currently operate.\n\nThe living wage is a concept defined by Anker and Anker (2017) as 'Remuneration received by a worker in a particular place sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and her or his family. Elements of a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, health care, transport, clothing, and other essential needs, including provision for unexpected events'. To develop living wage standards that are complete and have a reliable geographical scope, we combined forces with Valuing Nature, several local NGOs, WageIndicator and other global corporates.\n\nIn 2019, we conducted our first analysis of salaries and benefits for employees globally with respect to the living wage. This analysis covered 78 countries and we identified 31 employees in one country for whom wages and benefits were slightly below the defined living wage. Based on these results, our local HR teams made relevant adjustments for the year 2020.\n\nIn 2020, we performed the same analysis with the updated living wage data from WageIndicator. This time, all wages and benefits were above the defined living wage levels in all 78 countries.\n\n## Human rights 5.4.9\n\nWe believe that businesses have the responsibility to respect human rights and the ability to contribute to positive human rights impacts. The Philips' Sustainability Board leads our efforts to respect human rights. This is the highest governing sustainability body, which meets quarterly. It defines Philips' ESG strategy, programs and policies, including human rights. It also monitors progress and takes corrective action where needed.\n\nIn 2020, we advanced our human rights due diligence globally as a result of the outcomes of our 2018 Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA), and deployed a new assessment, covering five manufacturing sites and over 4,000 employees. With these assessments, 60% of our at-risk sites received a dedicated HRIA in the past 3 years (target 2023: 100%). The methodology was enhanced to enable assessments at a greater scale, focusing on human rights of our direct and indirect workers. We also discussed our human rights strategy and its implications during our yearly training program for our General Business Principles (GBP) Compliance Officer network. Given their prominent role in our grievance mechanism, the\n\ndiscussion focused on human rights awareness and its connection with relevant internal policies and investigation procedures.\n\nFinally, we sharpened our commitment to human rights by revising and updating our Human Rights Policy, alongside our updated Fair Employment and Inclusion & Diversity policies. These policies, together with the long-established General Business Principles (GBP), offer details on how we respect human rights as set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In this, we follow the guidance given in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Philips has also been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2007. Our Human Rights Report contains detailed information regarding our progress, targets and plans for continuous improvement.\n\n## Health and Safety 5.4.10\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic significantly affected Philips' global operations in many ways including government-mandated lockdowns, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply chain shortages, travel restrictions, and most importantly ensuring employee health and safety whilst maintaining critical operational commitments. Philips responded by developing a Triple Duty of Care strategy: continuing to fulfill critical customer needs, ensuring the health and safety of employees, and ensuring business continuity. A Group Crisis Operations Team and local Crisis Management Teams were activated to provide a global integrated response. This enabled Philips to disseminate a centralized and consistent message for every employee, regardless of market, business or location. A COVID-19 intranet site with guidance and information was set up and received over 128,000 hits in 2020.\n\nWorking as a team across all functions, Philips was able to maintain manufacturing operations (and in some cases significantly increase output) and also ensure support for our customers, including frontline hospitals, to minimize interruption to key service and support activities. During 2020, approximately 1,800 Philips employees were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Whilst most infections were of mild severity, there were unfortunately some more severe outcomes, including a small number of fatalities. However, less than 1% of contamination cases and none of the fatalities resulted from infections acquired during workplace activities.\n\nUnfortunately, one Philips employee was fatally injured in a road traffic accident in India in 2020. This happened when company transport taking employees home after a shift was involved in an accident during bad weather.",

Since 2016, the Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate has been defined as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). A TRC is a case where an injured employee is unable to work for one or more days, has medical treatment, or sustains an industrial illness. We set yearly TRC targets for the company, businesses and industrial sites.\n\nWe recorded 185 TRCs in 2020, a 17% decrease compared to 224 in 2019. While our workforce continued to expand in 2020, the TRC rate decreased from 0.30 per hundred FTEs in 2019 to 0.24 in 2020.\n\nIn 2020 we recorded 98 Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC). These are occupational injury cases where an injured person is unable to work for one or more days after the injury. This represents a 5% decrease compared with 103 in 2019. The LWIC rate decreased to 0.13 per 100 FTEs in 2020, compared with 0.14 in 2019. The number of Lost Workdays caused by injuries decreased by 1,845 days (40%) to 2,788 days in 2020.\n\nFor more information on Health and Safety, please refer to Health and Safety performance, starting on page 261\n\n## Philips Foundation 5.4.11\n\nStichting Philips Foundation, an independent foundation organized under Dutch law, is a registered charity established in 2014. In 2020, Royal Philips supported the Philips Foundation with a contribution of EUR 6.7 million, and provided the operating staff as well as the expert assistance of skilled employees in the execution of the Foundation's programs.\n\nThe Philips Foundation's mission is to reduce healthcare inequality by providing access to quality healthcare for disadvantaged communities. It does this through the provision and application of Philips' healthcare expertise, innovation power, talent and resources and by financial support. Together with key partners around the globe (including respected NGOs such as Red Cross organizations, UNICEF, Amref and Save the Children), the Philips Foundation seeks to identify challenges where a combination of Philips expertise and partner experience can be used to create meaningful solutions that have an impact on people's lives.\n\nFor more information on the Philips Foundation, please refer to Philips Foundation, starting on page 260.\n\n## Working with stakeholders 5.4.12\n\nIn organizing ourselves around customers and markets, we conduct dialogues with our stakeholders in order to explore common ground for addressing societal challenges, building partnerships and jointly developing supporting ecosystems for our innovations around the world.\n\nAn overview of stakeholders and topics discussed is provided in Sustainability statements, starting on page 244.\n\nFor more information on our stakeholder engagement activities in 2020, please refer to Stakeholder engagement, starting on page 270.\n\n## Governance 5.5\n\n## Corporate governance structure 5.5.1\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. (Royal Philips), a company organized under Dutch law, is the parent company of the Philips group. Its shares have been listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange (Euronext Amsterdam) since 1912. Furthermore, its shares have been traded in the United States since 1962 and have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1987.\n\nRoyal Philips has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board, each of which is accountable to the General Meeting of Shareholders for the fulfillment of its respective duties.\n\nThe company is governed by Dutch corporate and securities laws, its Articles of Association, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and of the Supervisory Board respectively. Its corporate governance framework is also based on the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (dated December 8, 2016) and US laws and regulations applicable to Foreign Private Issuers. Additionally, the Board of Management has implemented the Philips General Business Principles (GBP) and underlying policies, as well as separate codes of ethics that apply to employees working in specific areas of our business, i.e. the Financial Code of Ethics and the Procurement Code of Ethics. Many of the documents referred to are published on the company's website and more information can be found in Our approach to risk management, starting on page 74.\n\nPlease also refer to Corporate governance, starting on page 110 where the main elements of the company's corporate governance structure have been addressed.\n\n## Philips Business System 5.5.2\n\nAs we drive our transformation to become a solutions provider to our customers and consumers, we have adopted a single standard operating model that defines exactly how we want to work - the Philips Business System (PBS).\n\nThe PBS integrates key aspects of how we operate - from our strategy, governance, organizational design, processes and systems, to our people and team practices, and our culture and performance management.",

One that aspires to the highest standards of quality and integrity in everything we do. Building on standard work and best practices, with clear accountabilities and a culture of continuous improvement and compliance. Applying our creativity to make a competitive difference in serving our customers. Making Philips the best place to work.\n\n## Quality & Regulatory 5.5.3\n\nOur business success depends on the quality of our products, services and solutions, and compliance with many regulations and standards on a global basis. We continue on our transformation journey to have customer-focused global processes, procedures, standards, and a quality mindset to help us maintain the highest possible level of quality in all our products.\n\nFor Philips, as a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards, including data privacy and cybersecurity, involves increased levels of investment along with the demands of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property, and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce. For information on how Philips manages cybersecurity risk, please refer to Operational risks, starting on page 79.\n\n## Quality\n\nPhilips is committed to delivering the highest quality products, services and solutions compliant with all applicable laws and standards. We are investing substantially in embedding quality in our organizational culture as well as consolidating and standardizing our Quality Management Systems. We will continue to raise the performance bar. Quality is an integral part of the evaluation of all levels of management. With consistency of purpose, top-down accountability, consolidation, standardization and leveraging continuous improvement, we aim to drive greater speed in the adoption of a quality mindset as well as improved quality outcomes throughout the enterprise.\n\n## Regulatory Compliance\n\nPhilips actively maintains Quality Systems globally that establish processes for its product design, manufacturing and distribution processes; these standards are in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements. Our businesses are subject to compliance with regulatory pre-marketing and quality system requirements in every market we serve, and to specific requirements of local and national regulatory authorities including the US FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China and comparable agencies in\n\nother countries. We also must comply with the European Union's Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), Energy-using Products (EuP) and Product Safety Regulations.\n\nWe have a growing portfolio of regulated products in our Personal Health and Sleep & Respiratory Care businesses. Through our growing Oral Healthcare, Mother & Child Care and beauty product portfolio, the range of applicable regulations has been extended to include requirements relating to cosmetics and, on a very small scale, pharmaceuticals.\n\nOften, new products that we introduce are subject to a pre-market regulatory processes (e.g. pre-market notification (510[k]), or pre-market approval (PMA) for marketing of FDA-regulated devices in the USA, and CE Marking in the European Union). Failing to comply with the regulatory requirements can have significant legal and business consequences. The number and diversity of regulatory bodies in the various markets we operate in globally adds complexity and time to product introductions.\n\nIn the European Union (EU), a new Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) was published in 2017, which will impose significant additional pre-market and postmarket requirements. Since the announcement of the EU MDR, Philips has been executing a comprehensive strategic plan to ensure compliance with the MDR requirements that will come into effect in May 2021. The company has engaged in a top-to-bottom review of our full portfolio of products and solutions that fall under the mandate, and has developed a robust and detailed framework for a seamless transition by the time the Medical Device Regulation is operative. We have accomplished several milestones within the program: completing certifying audits, receiving updated CE Certificates and executing several shipments of MDR compliant products to the EU ahead of the date of application. To achieve these milestones, we made an annual EU MDR investment of around EUR 68 million in 2020 and will expect to have additional compliance costs for the new regulations of around EUR 37 million in 2021. We believe the global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.\n\n## Consent Decree\n\nIn October 2017, Philips North America LLC reached agreement on a consent decree with the US Department of Justice, representing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), related to compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements arising from past inspections in and before 2015, focusing primarily on Philips' Emergency Care & Resuscitation (ECR) business operations in Andover (Massachusetts) and Bothell (Washington).",

        "page_content": "## 5.5.4 Environmental, Social and Governance\n\nUnder the decree, Philips suspended the manufacture and distribution for the US market of external defibrillators, subject to certain exceptions. In January 2020, the Emergency Care & Resuscitation (ECR) business obtained Quality Management System Certification from an independent expert, fulfilling a significant consent decree requirement. Following a successful inspection in Bothell (Washington), in April 2020, FDA determined that Philips had met the conditions for resuming on the manufacture and distribution of defibrillators in the US. The consent decree remains in effect for a number of years, during which the Emergency Care & Resuscitation (ECR) business will be subject to a series of annual assessments by an independent expert.\n\nSubstantial progress continues to be made in our compliance efforts. However, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and the consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing ECR or Monitoring & Analytics devices, recall products, pay liquidated damages and take other actions. We also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter's ultimate impact on our business.\n\n## Remuneration policy 5.5.4\n\nOur remuneration policy is designed to encourage employees to deliver on our purpose and strategy and create stakeholder value, and to motivate and retain them. Our executive long-term incentive plan includes environmental and social commitments. A description of the composition of the remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is included in Report of the Remuneration Committee, starting on page 94.\n\n## General Business Principles 5.5.5\n\nWhile pursuing our business objectives, we aim to be a responsible partner in society, acting with integrity towards our employees, customers, business partners and shareholders, as well as the wider community in which we operate. Everyone at Philips is expected to always act with integrity, and Philips rigorously enforces compliance of its General Business Principles (GBP) throughout the company.\n\nIn the highly regulated world of healthcare, integrity requires in-depth knowledge of the applicable rules and regulations and a sensitivity to healthcare-specific issues. The GBP - part of the Philips Business System - incorporate and represent the fundamental principles by which all Philips businesses and employees around the globe must abide. They set the minimum standard for business conduct, both for individual employees and for the company and our subsidiaries. Our GBP also serve as a reference for the business conduct we expect from our business partners and suppliers.\n\nTranslations of the GBP text are available in 30 languages, allowing almost every employee to read the GBP in their native language. Detailed underlying policies, manuals, training, and tools are in place to give employees practical guidance on how to apply and uphold the GBP in their daily work environment. Details can be found at www.philips.com/gbp.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 571 concerns were reported via Philips Speak Up (Ethics Line) and through our network of GBP Compliance Officers. The previous reporting period (2019) saw a total of 545 concerns, resulting in an increase of 5% in the number of reports.\n\nWhile this is a continuation of the upward trend reported since 2014, the year in which Philips updated its General Business Principles and deployed a strengthened global communication campaign, the increase is flattening. Specifically in 2020, we focused on increasing awareness on Integrity and on the importance of speaking up, through and following up on the deployment of our biennial Business Integrity Survey. We still believe the upward trend in reporting remains in line with our multi-year efforts to encourage our employees to express their concerns, but the extraordinary business conditions in 2020 make it imprudent to draw any specific conclusions from these numbers.\n\nMore information on the Philips GBP can be found in Risk management, starting on page 74.\n\nThe results of the monitoring measures in place are given in General Business Principles, starting on page 268\n\n## Risk management approach 5.5.6\n\nRisk management and control forms an integral part of the Philips business planning and performance review cycle. The company's risk management policy and framework are designed to provide reasonable assurance that its strategic and operational objectives are met, that legal requirements are complied with, and that the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures is safeguarded. Please refer to Risk management, starting on page 74 for a more detailed description of Philips' approach to risk management (including Internal Control over Financial Reporting), risk categories and factors, and certain specific risks that have been identified.\n\nWith respect to financial reporting, a structured self-assessment and monitoring process is used company-wide to assess, document, review and monitor compliance with Internal Control over Financial Reporting. On the basis of the outcome of this process, the Board of Management confirms that: (i) the management report (within the meaning of section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code) provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems; (ii) such systems provide a reasonable level of",

The financial statements fairly represent the financial condition and result of operations of the company and provide the required disclosures.\n\nIn view of the above, the Board of Management believes that it is in compliance with best practice 1.4.2 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. It should be noted that the above does not imply that the internal risk management and control systems provide certainty as to the realization of operational and financial business objectives, nor can they prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud or non-compliances with rules and regulations. The above statement on internal control should not be construed as a statement in response to the requirements of section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The statement as to compliance with section 404 is set forth in Management's report on internal control, starting on page 120.\n\n## Total tax contribution 5.5.7\n\nTo fulfill our company purpose, a responsible tax approach is required. We fully acknowledge our societal role when it comes to paying taxes in the geographies where value is created. We consider our tax payments as a contribution to the communities in which we operate, as part of our social value creation.\n\nOur Approach to Tax sets the standard for our conduct, by which individual employees, the company and its subsidiaries must abide. We consider tax in the context of the broader society, inspired by our stakeholder dialogues, global initiatives of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and United Nations, human rights, international (tax) laws and regulations and relevant codes of conduct.\n\nUnder the ultimate responsibility of the Board of Management, the Chief Financial Officer annually reviews, evaluates, approves and where necessary adjusts Philips' approach to tax. Philips supports and participates in transparency initiatives such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and the Tax Transparency Benchmark of the Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development (VBDO).\n\nIn 2020, Philips contributed to the communities where we operate through taxes paid (e.g. corporate income tax) and taxes collected (e.g. VAT). As part of its ESG commitments, announced in September 2020, Philips committed to provide more transparency on its taxes paid and collected in the countries it operates in. Our first Country Activity and Tax Report can be found on our website.

Philips' risk management approach is an integral part of the Philips Business System (PBS), and key elements are our Risk management governance, Risk appetite, the Risk Management Process standard, the Philips Business Control Framework, and our General Business Principles (GBP). These are further described in this chapter. The company's risk management is designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and operational objectives are met, legal requirements are complied with, and the integrity of the company's financial reporting and related disclosures is safeguarded. However, there can be no absolute assurance that our risk management will avoid or mitigate all risks that Philips faces. The material risks are described in Risk factors, starting on page 77.\n\nAll forward-looking statements made on or after the date of this Annual Report and attributable to Philips are expressly qualified, in their entirety, by the factors described in the cautionary statement included in Forward-looking statements and other information, starting on page 237 and in the overview of risk factors described in Risk factors, starting on page 77.\n\n## Risk management governance\n\nThe Executive Committee identifies, oversees, and manages the risks Philips faces in realizing its objectives. It defines the Risk Appetite, provides the risk management framework and monitors the effectiveness thereof. The Risk Management Support Team, consisting of experts on various categories of enterprise risk, supports the Executive Committee through regular analysis of the enterprise risk profile and enhancement of the risk management framework. Management is responsible for identifying critical risks and implementing appropriate risk responses within their area of responsibility. Various functions (such as Internal Control, Quality & Regulatory, and Group Security) support management of specific risk areas.\n\nThe Internal Audit function assesses the quality of risk management and controls through the execution of a risk-based audit plan, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Leadership from our Board of Management, Executive Committee, Businesses, Markets and key Functions meet quarterly with Internal Audit in Audit & Risk Committees to discuss strengths and weaknesses of risk management and controls - as evaluated by internal and external auditors\n\nThe Disclosure Committee oversees the company's disclosure activities and assists the Board of Management in fulfilling its responsibilities in this respect. The Committee's purpose is to ensure that the company implements and maintains internal procedures for the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure, as appropriate, of information potentially subject to public disclosure under the legal, regulatory and stock exchange requirements to which the company is subject.\n\nThe Security Steering Committee (SSC) and the Group Security function manage security (including cybersecurity) risks at Philips. The SSC evaluates and sets the Group's security strategy, issues security policies and evaluates progress and effectiveness. Dedicated security reports are shared with the Executive Committee, Supervisory Board and external auditors. On a quarterly basis, briefings on cybersecurity risks are provided to the IT Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Quality & Regulatory Committee of the Supervisory Board assist the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk. The quality of risk management and controls, and the findings of internal and external audits, are reported to, and discussed with, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Quality & Regulatory Committee's role particularly relates to the quality, including regulatory compliance, of the Company's products (including software), services and systems and their development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing.\n\nIn Corporate governance, starting on page 110 the Company addresses the main elements of its corporate governance structure, reports on how it applies the principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, and provides certain other information.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Executive Committee and management seek to manage risks consistently within the risk appetite. Risk appetite is set by the Executive Committee and captured in the Risk Management Policy. It is effectuated as an integral part of our PBS, of which various elements - e.g. Strategy, Behaviors, GBP, Authority Schedules, Policies, Process Standards and Performance Management Systems include or reflect risk-taking guidance.",

        "page_content": "Philips' risk appetite differs depending on the type of risk, ranging from an averse to a seeking approach. We believe we must operate within the dynamics of the health technology industry and take the risks needed to ensure we continually revitalize our offerings and the way we work. At the same time, Philips attaches prime importance to integrity, sustainability, product quality and safety, including compliance with regulations and quality standards. Risk appetite for the four main risk categories is visualized below.\n\nPhilips does not classify these risk categories in order of importance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management process\n\nIn order to provide a comprehensive view of Philips' risks, structured risk assessments take place according to the Philips risk management process standard, applying a top-down and bottom-up approach. Our process standard is designed based on the Enterprise Risk Management Framework: Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) from the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (COSO) and on ISO 31000 - Risk Management. The process is supported by regular risk workshops with management at Group, Business, Market and Function levels. During 2020, several risk management workshops were held to assess and respond to enterprise risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey elements of the Philips Risk Management Policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of Businesses, Markets and key Functions perform a risk assessment at least once a year, with updates of the strategic plan. Risk workshops are conducted across the company to facilitate these risk assessments. Management identifies and prioritizes risk, assigns ownership and implements appropriate risk responses;\n- \u00b7 Management discusses and monitors the risk profile and risk response effectiveness at least quarterly in management's performance reviews and Audit & Risk Committees;\n- \u00b7 Developments in the enterprise risk profile and management's initiatives to improve risk responses are discussed and monitored during the quarterly meeting of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 As an integral part of the strategy review, each year the Executive Committee assesses the enterprise risk profile and the potential risk impact versus Group risk appetite. This assessment considers various inputs such as risk assessments from Businesses, Markets and Functions, Philips Internal Audit findings, Legal and Insurance matters, the materiality analysis, and external research. The assessment also covers the effectiveness of the risk management framework and potential improvements thereto;\n- \u00b7 The Philips risk profile and the risk management framework are discussed at least once a year with the Supervisory Board.",

The objective of the PBCF is to maintain integrated management control of the company's operations in order to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting, as well as compliance with laws and regulations. Philips has designed its PBCF based on the COSO Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013).\n\nAs part of the PBCF, Philips has implemented a standard set of internal controls over financial reporting. Together with Philips' established accounting procedures, this standard set of internal controls is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial statements, that policies and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and do not contain any material misstatements. In each unit, management is responsible for customizing the controls set for their business, risk profile and operations.\n\nEach year, management's accountability for internal controls for financial reporting is evidenced through the formal certification statement sign-off. Any deficiencies noted in the design and operating effectiveness of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting which were not completely remediated, are evaluated at\n\nyear-end by the Board of Management. The Board of Management's report, including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, can be found in Management's report on internal control, starting on page 120\n\n## Philips General Business Principles (GBP)\n\nAs part of the Philips Business System, our GBP set the standard for our business conduct as a health technology company. The GBP form an integral part of labor contracts in virtually every country in which Philips operates, and translations are available in 30 languages. Each year, employees reconfirm their commitment to the code of conduct after completing their GBP e-learning, while there is an additional annual sign-off for Executives. A similar sign-off is in place for Finance and Procurement staff for their respective codes of conduct. Detailed underlying policies, manuals, training, and tools are in place to give employees practical guidance on how to apply and uphold the GBP in their daily work.\n\nThe GBP Review Committee is responsible for the effective deployment of the GBP and for generally promoting a culture of compliance and ethics within the company. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer, and its members include the Chief Financial Officer, Chief HR Officer and the Chief of International Markets. Furthermore, all our 17 markets have quarterly market compliance committees, which act as local satellites of the GBP Review Committee, dealing with GBP-related matters within the local context. They are also responsible for the design and execution of localized compliance plans that are tailored to their market-specific risks and organizational set-up, and regularly review the relevant compliance metrics for their respective market through dashboards delivered by the legal compliance monitoring team. The Secretariat of the GBP Review Committee, together with a worldwide network of GBP Compliance Officers, supports the organization with the implementation of GBP initiatives.\n\nAs part of our continuous effort to raise GBP awareness and foster dialogue throughout the organization, each year a global GBP communications and training plan is deployed, including our annual GBP Dialogue Initiative, aimed at reinforcing a culture of dialogue through the use of ethical dilemma case studies that are relevant to our workforce.\n\nA key control to measure implementation of our GBP is the GBP Self-Assessment, which is part of our Internal Control framework. In addition, we continue to expand the capabilities of our legal compliance monitoring team, serving both our business customers as well as compliance networks with actionable compliance data, thus further improving our compliance control framework.\n\nThe GBP are supported by established mechanisms that ensure standardized reporting and enable both employees and third parties to escalate concerns 24/7. Concerns raised are registered consistently in a single database hosted outside of",

Encouraging people to speak up through the available channels if they have a concern will continue to be a cornerstone of our GBP communications and awareness campaigns. To further facilitate this, we completely redesigned our web-based intake site in 2020, improving employees' experience when filing reports. At least twice a year, the GBP Review Committee, as well as the Executive Committee and Audit Committee, are informed on relevant GBP metrics, cases, trends and learnings.\n\nThrough the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, the company also has procedures in place for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints specifically relating to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. The Reporting Policy Accounting and Audit Matters allows the confidential, anonymous submission of complaints regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\n\nThe GBP and underlying policies, including the Financial and Procurement Code of Ethics, are published on the company website, at www.philips.com/gbp.\n\n## Risk factors 6.2\n\nPhilips believes the risks set out below are the material risks that could impact its ability to achieve its objectives. These risk factors may not, however, include all the risks that ultimately may affect Philips. Some risks not yet known to Philips, or currently believed not to be material, may ultimately have a major impact on Philips' business, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, capital resources and/or ability to achieve its business objectives. Philips defines risks in four main categories: Strategic, Operational, Compliance and Financial risks. Philips presents the risk factors within each risk category in order of Philips' current view of their expected significance. This does not mean that a lower-listed risk factor may not have a material and adverse impact on Philips' business, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, capital resources and/or ability to achieve its business objectives. Furthermore, a risk factor listed below other risk factors may ultimately prove to have more significant adverse consequences than those other risk factors.\n\nFor each risk factor, we set out below responses that we believe help us to manage these risks. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions effectively. If circumstances occur or are not sufficiently mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be material adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described, which may include forward-looking statements, or could impact our ability to meet our targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation. The risk responses\n\ndescribed below are designed to manage risks towards, and should be read in conjunction with, the Risk Appetite as described above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic risks 6.3\n\n## Philips may be unable to adapt swiftly to changes in industry or market circumstances.\n\nFundamental shifts in the health technology industry, such as the transition to digital and increased emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance), may drastically change the business environment in which Philips operates. If Philips fails to recognize these changes in time, adjust business models, or introduce new products and services in response to these changes, or fails to meet its ESG commitments, this could result in a material adverse effect on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips performs ongoing analyses of markets and competitive developments including financials, market shares, M&A, investments and partnerships, product introductions and innovations, patents and hiring trends. Philips monitors and maintains relationships with policy makers and regulatory and standard setting bodies to stay on top of changes in policies, legislation, regulation and other external standards. Our consultative customer partnerships and services business models, through which we establish long-term strategic partnerships with customers; including leading practitioners in healthcare, provide us with a deep understanding of their (future) needs. Philips continuously invests significantly in R&D in innovation and new products and services; our Innovation 2025 transformation program is accelerating the innovation ambitions across all elements of the Philips Business System. We have raised our ESG commitments towards 2025, examples of enablers are our practices defined by the Philips Business System and 100% of product offerings in line with EcoDesign requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Philips' global operations are exposed to economic, political and societal changes.\n\n## Philips' overall risk profile is changing as a result of its focus on health technology and solutions.\n\nPhilips' business environment is influenced by political, economic and societal conditions in individual and global markets. Inevitably there is uncertainty with regard to the levels of (public) capital expenditure in general, unemployment levels, and consumer and business confidence, all of which could adversely affect demand for products and services offered by Philips.\n\nMature economies are currently the main source of revenues, while emerging economies are an increasing source of revenues. Philips sources its products and services mainly from the US, the EU (primarily the Netherlands) and China, and the majority of Philips' assets are located in these geographies. Changes in monetary policy and trade and tax laws in the US, China and EU can have a significant adverse impact on other mature economies, emerging economies and international financial markets. Such changes, including tariffs and sanctions, import or export controls, increased healthcare regulation, nationalization of assets or restrictions on the repatriation of returns from foreign investments, may trigger reactions and countermeasures, leading to adverse impacts on global trade levels and flows, economic growth and political stability, all of which may have an adverse effect on business growth and stability on international financial markets.\n\nThe factors described above, or other factors which may impact economic and societal conditions relevant to Philips (e.g. COVID-19 and Brexit), are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse impact on Philips' business, financial condition and operating results. They can also make it more difficult to budget and make reliable financial forecasts or could have a negative impact on Philips' access to funding.\n\nRisk response: Philips monitors economic, political and general societal changes and, where deemed necessary, develops response strategies to such events, including pandemics (e.g. COVID-19) and Brexit.\n\nPhilips is active in more than 100 countries and this global footprint allows us to absorb adverse local market developments. High-risk markets (i.e. exposed to high volatility) are regularly assessed for emerging risks, and capital structure planning is performed.\n\nPhilips optimizes its integrated supply chain organization, its supplier base and manufacturing footprint to enable agile responses to large and rapid shifts in demand and supply.\n\nAs Philips' business profile continues to further shift focus towards health technology, with a changing products and services portfolio and acquisitions, divestments and partnerships to support the execution of its health technology strategy, Philips is more exposed to developments in the health technology industry. It may therefore have a reduced ability to offset potential negative impacts of those developments through a more diversified portfolio. As Philips transitions from selling health technology products to selling health technology solutions, the nature of our customer relations is also evolving, which raises the long-term risk of (amongst others) customer default and dependency. Philips may pursue divestments from time to time, including divestments consistent with Philips' focus on health technology, such as the disentanglement and future divestment of Philips' Domestic Appliances business. These divestments may result in additional costs and divert management attention from other business priorities and risks, and the timing, terms, execution and proceeds of any such divestments are uncertain.\n\nRisk response: Philips operates in a growing, evolving healthcare market. Our portfolio covers various products and services across the entire health continuum without significant dependence on a single product, service or market. Where we engage in long-term service-based business models we run a disciplined deal process with strict acceptance criteria.\n\nScenarios for execution of divestments are reviewed with input from various internal and external professional parties. Philips has a proven process for the preparation and execution of divestments.\n\n## Philips' overall performance in coming years depends on realization of its objectives in growth geographies.\n\nGrowth geographies are becoming increasingly important to Philips' business plan, and Asia is an important production, sourcing and design center for Philips. Philips faces intense competition from local companies as well as other global players for market share in growth geographies. Philips needs to maintain and grow its position in growth geographies, invest in data-driven services and local talent, understand end-user preferences, and localize its portfolio in order to stay competitive. If Philips fails to achieve these objectives, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and operating results.",

This local presence enables Philips to tailor its propositions to local market needs and activate locally.\n\n## Acquisitions could fail to deliver on their business plans and expose Philips to integration risks.\n\nSelected acquisitions have been and are expected to be a part of Philips' growth strategy. Acquisitions may expose Philips to integration risks in areas such as sales and service, logistics, regulatory compliance, information technology and finance. Integration challenges may adversely impact the realization of expected contributions from acquisitions. Philips may incur significant costs in connection with these transactions. Acquisitions may also divert management attention from other business priorities. Cost savings expected to be implemented following an acquisition may be difficult to achieve. Acquisitions may also lead to a substantial increase in long-lived assets, including goodwill, which may later be subject to write-down if an acquired business does not perform as expected, which may have a material adverse effect on Philips' earnings.\n\nRisk response: Philips has an active acquisition allocation strategy and M&A roadmap per growth area to ensure organizational fit.\n\nPhilips uses a structured and disciplined acquisition process with strict acceptance criteria, budgets and tollgates and time allocated for critical review of due diligence, including integration risks and expected integration benefits. A broad range of internal and external functional experts is involved in this process.\n\nPhilips develops and deploys a high-quality post-acquisition integration playbook with set milestones and conducts value creation progress reviews with the responsible business leader throughout the integration of each acquisition.\n\n## Philips may be unable to secure and maintain intellectual property rights for its products and services or may infringe others' intellectual property rights.\n\nPhilips is dependent on its ability to obtain and maintain licenses and other intellectual property (IP) rights covering its products and services and its design and manufacturing processes. The IP portfolio is the result of an extensive patenting process that could be influenced by a number of factors, including innovation. The value of the IP portfolio is dependent on the successful promotion and market acceptance of standards developed or co-developed by Philips. This is particularly applicable to the segment Other, where licenses from Philips to third parties generate IP royalties and are important to Philips' results of operations. The timing of licenses from Philips to third parties and associated revenues from IP royalties are uncertain and may vary significantly from period to period. A loss or impairment in connection with such licenses to third parties could have a\n\nmaterial adverse impact on Philips' financial condition and operating results. Philips is also exposed to the risk that a third party may claim to own the intellectual property rights to technology applied in Philips' products and services. If any such claims of infringement of these intellectual property rights are successful, Philips may be required to pay damages to such third parties or may incur other costs or losses.\n\nRisk response: Philips has an Intellectual Property & Standards organization (IP&S) that proactively pursues the creation of new Intellectual Property (IP) in close co-operation with Philips' operating businesses and Innovation & Strategy. IP&S is a leading industrial IP organization providing world-class IP solutions to Philips' businesses to support their growth, competitiveness and profitability.\n\nIn addition, Philips believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular third-party patent or license, or any particular group of third-party patents and licenses.\n\n## Operational risks 6.4\n\n## COVID-19 and other pandemics could have an adverse effect on Philips' operations and employees.\n\nCOVID-19 has affected Philips' operations and results in 2020. Looking ahead, Philips continues to see uncertainty and volatility related to the impact of COVID-19 across the world, driven by, amongst others, the effectiveness of vaccination programs, mutations of COVID-19 and potentially new viruses which may cause new pandemics. Philips expects that COVID-19 may continue to impact the delivery on our triple duty of care in various ways: health and safety of our employees (in various working environments such as production, supply, field service, R&D, and working from home); meeting critical customer needs (for example to our production capacity and our ability to deliver, install and provide service); and business continuity (for example of our functional operations, supply chain, and commercial processes). These will require effort and expense to deal with and may negatively impact results from operations for an uncertain period.\n\nPhilips' customers may not be focused on making new investments or face liquidity issues caused by COVID-19, which may adversely impact Philips' cash flow generation. COVID-19 may also affect planned divestments consistent with Philips' focus on health technology, including in relation to Philips' Domestic Appliances business; the timing, terms, execution and proceeds of any such disposals may become more uncertain. Some further COVID-19 impacts are described in other risk factors.",

Risk workshops are held across the business to calibrate cybersecurity risks and the appropriate risk appetite.\n\nPhilips focuses on delivering on its triple duty of care:\n\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding the health and safety of employees (including personal hygiene measures and safety protocols, working from home protocol, safe working environments, personal protective equipment);\n- \u00b7 Meeting critical customer needs (including production volume ramp-up, delivery and installation of critical equipment, fair and ethical allocation of scarce equipment and supplies, customer services, updated clinical guidance);\n- \u00b7 Ensuring business continuity (including liquidity measures and our Business Continuity Management System covering functional operations, integrated supply chain and commercial processes).\n\n## Philips could be exposed to a significant cybersecurity breach.\n\nPhilips relies on information technology to operate and manage its businesses and store confidential data (relating to employees, customers, intellectual property, suppliers and other partners). Philips' products, solutions and services increasingly contain sophisticated and complex information technology and generate confidential data related to customers and patients. Potential geopolitical conflicts and criminal activity continue to drive increases in the number and severity of cyber-attacks in general. Like many other multinational companies, Philips is therefore inherently and increasingly exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks. Information systems may be damaged, disrupted (including the provision of services to customers) or shut down due to cyber-attacks. In addition, breaches in the security of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information (including intellectual property) or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, customers, suppliers or other partners. These risks are particularly significant with respect to patient medical records. Cyber-attacks may result in substantial costs and other negative consequences, which may include, but are not limited to, lost revenues, reputational damage, remediation and enhancement costs, and other liabilities to regulators, customers and other partners, or penalties. While cyber-attacks have not historically resulted in significant damage or caused Philips to incur significant monetary cost in taking corrective action, there can be no assurance that future cyber-attacks will not result in significant or other consequences than described above.\n\nRisk response: Philips has established a Group Security function and implemented security management processes and controls, as well as monitoring risk trends on material security topics, such as the risk of security breaches in our information systems and our products and services. The Security Steering\n\nPhilips assesses and continuously improves key security controls for business applications and conducts vulnerability scans. We have strengthened the IT function to assure IT systems are kept up to date and applications are designed and developed with security in mind. In addition, Philips evaluates its supply chain and continuously monitors the security maturity of critical suppliers and their performance against contractually agreed security standards.\n\nPhilips maintains relationships and cooperates with several government intelligence and law enforcement agencies in order to remain abreast of new threats.\n\n## Philips is exposed to risks in connection with IT system changes or failures.\n\nPhilips continuously seeks to create a more open, standardized and cost-effective IT landscape, for instance through further outsourcing, offshoring, commoditization and ongoing reduction in the number of IT systems. These changes create third-party dependency risk with regard to the delivery of IT services, the availability of IT systems, and the scope and nature of the functionality offered by IT systems. Although Philips has sought to strengthen security measures and quality controls relating to these systems, these measures may prove to be insufficient or unsuccessful.\n\nRisk response: Philips uses a risk assessment method and runs risk workshops to identify and address risks to our critical business applications. The IT Business Continuity Management plan includes, for example, real-time monitoring availability, redundancies, testing, and upgrading of applications.\n\nWe validate IT systems and strengthen our IT Change Management to make sure that every change of an IT system is executed in a controlled way and sufficiently tested to minimize the impact in terms of business disruption due to failure of the system.\n\n## Philips may be unable to ensure an effective supply chain.\n\nPhilips is continuing the process of creating a leaner supply base and is continuing its initiatives to replace internal capabilities with less costly outsourced products and services. These processes may result in increased dependency on a concentration of external suppliers. Although Philips works closely with its suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that it will not encounter supply problems in the future causing disruptions or unfavorable conditions.",

        "page_content": "## 6.4 Risk management\n\nShortages or delays could materially harm Philips' business. Most of Philips' operations are conducted internationally, which exposes Philips to challenges. For example, Philips depends partly on the production and procurement of products and parts from Asian countries; the production and shipping of products and parts could be interrupted by events such as geopolitical changes (e.g. US-China relations), regional conflicts, pandemics (e.g. COVID-19), natural disasters or extreme weather events caused by climate change. Such changes may lead to adverse impacts on global trade levels and supply chains. COVID-19, more specifically, imposes supply chain challenges due to shifts in demand, need for production capacity adjustments and impacts on the safety of the environments for production, field service, installations, R&D.\n\nA general shortage of materials, (sub) components also poses the risk of fluctuations in prices and demand, which could have a material adverse effect on Philips' financial condition and operating results. Philips purchases raw materials, including so-called rare earth metals, copper, steel, aluminum, noble gases and oil-related products, which exposes it to fluctuations in energy and raw material prices. Commodities have been subject to volatile markets, and such volatility is expected to continue. If Philips is not able to compensate for increased costs of raw materials, reduce reliance on such raw materials or pass on increased costs to customers, then price increases could have a material adverse impact on Philips' results.\n\nRisk response: Philips is expanding its 'Design for Excellence' approach to the full value chain, which includes designing products in such a way that supply dependencies are minimal.\n\nPhilips is optimizing its integrated supply chain organization, forecasting analytics, supplier base and manufacturing footprint to enable agile responses to large and rapid shifts in demand and supply and a changing geopolitical risk landscape.\n\nPhilips has deployed an integrated supplier risk management framework to assess and manage suppliers from various perspectives such as strategic fit, financial stability, operational performance and quality, sustainability, compliance and location.\n\nPhilips conducts various assessments and develops response strategies to events potentially impacting its supply chain, such as changes in trade agreements (e.g. Brexit), natural disasters, emerging markets volatility, and pandemics (e.g. COVID-19). Philips has deployed a global Business Continuity Management System, which is aligned to, and certified against, the ISO standard for Business Continuity.\n\nPhilips manages the risk of rising commodity prices by several means, including long-term contracting and keeping physical inventories. Philips closely monitors price developments and takes pricing action where appropriate.\n\n## Philips may face challenges to drive operational excellence, productivity and speed in bringing innovations to market.\n\nTo gain sustainable competitive advantage and realize Philips' ambitions for profitable growth, it is important that the company makes further improvements in its product and solution creation process, ensuring timely delivery of new products and solutions at lower cost and high customer service levels. The emergence of new low-cost competitors, particularly in Asia, further underlines the importance of improvements in the product creation process. The success of new product and solution creation, however, depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful completion of development, market acceptance, the ability to attract and retain skilled employees, production ramp-up to meet anticipated demand, potential quality issues or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Costs of developing new products and solutions may be reflected on Philips' balance sheet and may be subject to write-down or impairment as a result of the performance of such products or services; the significance and timing of such write-downs or impairments are uncertain. Accordingly, Philips cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new product and solution creation will have on its financial condition and operating results. If Philips fails to create and commercialize products and solutions, it may lose market share and competitiveness, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips is in continuous dialogue with customers to understand their needs and to reaffirm that its strategy and products and solutions portfolio are addressing these. Philips is driving a marketing transformation to accelerate the understanding of customer needs and to translate that understanding into integrated value propositions.\n\nPhilips is driving the Innovation 2025 transformation to accelerate its innovation ambitions across all elements of the Philips Business System, improving processes and tools in all aspects of innovation (from exploration to launch in the market). This is part of a broader transformation program, based on Lean Management and enabled by a dedicated Business Transformation organization, to enable Philips' overall strategic imperatives.\n\n## Philips is dependent on its people for leadership and specialized skills and may be unable to attract and retain such personnel.\n\nThe attraction and retention of talented employees in sales and marketing, research and development, finance, and general management, as well as highly specialized technical personnel, especially in transferring operations and enabling functions to low-cost countries, is critical to Philips' success.

The COVID-19 pandemic places additional challenges on team interactions and the onboarding of new people and brings uncertainty as to what will be the 'new normal' way of working after the pandemic. There can be no assurance that Philips will be successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified employees and the key personnel needed in the future.\n\nRisk response: Philips continuously assesses capability gaps for its key positions and has initiatives in place to close any employee capability gaps and maintains a remuneration structure aimed at attracting and retaining talent.\n\nPhilips measures employee engagement through regular surveys and benchmarks the results against high-performing external norms and across the organization. Philips performs deep-dives where necessary (for instance relating to the COVID-19 pandemic) and drives improvement actions to address any gaps.\n\n## Trade arrangements following Brexit could have an adverse effect on Philips' operations.\n\nPhilips sells products and services in the United Kingdom, although, following footprint adjustments, we no longer have manufacturing in the UK, only configuration. The potential financial impact following the trade arrangements between the UK and the EU or other countries following Brexit, ranges from adverse movements of the pound sterling versus the euro and the US dollar to supply chain disruptions due to the re-introduction of customs controls and the imposition of new tariffs on imports or exports to and from the United Kingdom. An unsuccessful response to trade arrangements may have a material adverse effect on Philips' financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: Philips has set up a Brexit taskforce including a governance structure and several workstreams which assess various scenarios and define contingency plans for these. Several measures related to duties, customs, regulatory, and data are being implemented to minimize the residual risks.\n\n## Compliance risks 6.5\n\nPhilips is exposed to non-compliance of its products and services with various regulations and standards including quality, product safety and data privacy.\n\nPhilips operates in a highly regulated product safety and quality environment and its products and services, including parts or materials from suppliers, are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies (e.g. FDA (US), EMA (Europe), NMPA (China), MHRA (UK), ASNM (France), BfArM (Germany), IGZ (the\n\nNetherlands)). In the European Union (EU), a new Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) was published in 2017, which will impose significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements. Examples of other product-related regulations are the EU's Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Energy-using Products (EuP).\n\nWith Philips' focus on healthcare, new products and services frequently require regulatory approvals for market introduction. The number and diversity of regulatory bodies in the various markets we operate in adds complexity and may negatively impact time to market and implementation costs. Non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls, a temporary ban on products, stoppages at production facilities, remediation costs, fines or claims for damages. Product safety incidents or user concerns, as in the past, could trigger business reviews by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, which, if failed, could trigger these impacts.\n\nThe ongoing digitalization of Philips' products and services, including its holding of personal health data and medical data, increases the importance of compliance with data privacy and similar laws.\n\nNon-compliance could adversely impact Philips' financial condition or operating result through lost revenue and cost of any required remedial actions, penalties or claims for damages. These issues could also further negatively impact Philips' reputation, brand, relationship with customers and market share.\n\nRisk response: Philips is committed to delivering the highest-quality products, services and solutions compliant with all applicable laws and standards. We continuously invest substantially in embedding quality in our organizational culture as well as consolidating and standardizing our Quality Management Systems. Quality is an integral part of the evaluation of all levels of management. With consistency of purpose, top-down accountability, consolidation, standardization and continuous improvement, we aim to drive greater speed in the adoption of a quality mindset as well as improved quality outcomes throughout the enterprise. Since the announcement of the EU MDR, Philips has been executing a comprehensive strategic plan to ensure compliance with the MDR requirements that will come into effect in May 2021.\n\nOur Quality & Regulatory Function closely monitors the developments in the regulatory landscape. Through specialist teams at global, regional or local level, detailed standards and requirements are defined as an integrated part of our process standards, and this ensures that our employees are aware of and able to comply with these requirements.",

Examples include commission payments to third parties, remuneration payments to agents, distributors, consultants and the like, and the acceptance of gifts, which may be considered in some markets to be normal local business practice. These risks could adversely affect Philips' financial condition, reputation and brand and trigger the additional risk of exposure to governmental investigations, inquiries and legal proceedings. For further detail see section 'Legal proceedings' within Contingent assets and liabilities, starting on page 185.\n\nRisk response: Over the years, we have extensively transformed the company and strengthened our business processes. As part of that, we have invested substantially in adherence to our General Business Principles through the deployment of various compliance and awareness programs, as well as the establishment of policies and processes that reinforce adherence. For more details, please refer to the sub-section Philips General Business Principles in the section Our approach to risk management, starting on page 74.\n\n## Financial risks 6.6\n\n## Philips is exposed to a variety of treasury and financing risks, including liquidity, currency, credit and country risk.\n\nNegative developments impacting the liquidity of global capital markets could affect Philips' ability to raise or re-finance debt in the capital markets or could lead to significant increases in the cost of such borrowing in the future. If the markets expect a downgrade by the rating agencies, or if such a downgrade has actually taken place, this could increase the cost of borrowing, reduce our potential investor base and adversely affect our business.\n\nPhilips operates in over 100 countries and its reported earnings and equity are therefore inevitably exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies against the euro. Philips' sales are sensitive in particular to movements in the US dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi and a wide range of other currencies from developed and emerging economies. Philips' sourcing and manufacturing spend is concentrated in the European Union, the United States and China. Income from operations is particularly sensitive to movements in currencies of countries where Philips has no or very small-scale manufacturing/ local sourcing activities but significant sales of its products or services, such as Japan, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and a range of emerging markets such as Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, India and Brazil.\n\nIn view of the long lifecycle of health technology solution sales and long-term strategic partnerships, the financial risk of counterparties with outstanding payment obligations creates exposure risks for Philips, particularly in relation to accounts receivable from customers, liquid assets, and the fair value of derivatives and insurance contracts with financial counterparties. A default by counterparties in such transactions can have a material adverse effect on Philips' financial condition and operating results.\n\nRisk response: At Philips, liquidity is monitored by the Group Treasury department, which tracks the actual cash flow for the Group against forecasts of the liquidity requirements on both a short- and longer-term basis. This includes regular reviews of liquidity versus credit rating constraints to manage the risk of potential negative outlooks or downgrades in credit ratings. Philips manages the available liquidity for the Group in several ways, e.g. by spreading maturities of external debt over time and by having appropriate standby credit facilities available. As an example, to anticipate potential liquidity constraints in the market caused by COVID-19, Philips took the decision to settle the dividend in respect of 2019 in shares only, to complete the remainder of the share buyback program through forward contracts, and to raise EUR 1 billion in bonds in March 2020.\n\nPhilips hedges the anticipated net exposure of developed-market foreign currencies resulting from sales and purchases in those currencies. For emerging markets, Philips mainly relies on pricing adjustments for its products and services to counteract any expected depreciation of emerging-market currencies.\n\nPhilips performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and other counterparties and uses various tools manage the credit risks.\n\nPlease also refer to Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 196.",

        "page_content": "## 6.6 Risk management\n\n## Philips is exposed to tax risks which could have a significant adverse financial impact.\n\nPhilips is exposed to tax risks which could result in double taxation, penalties and interest payments. The source of the risks could originate from local tax rules and regulations as well as international and EU regulatory frameworks. These include transfer pricing risks on internal cross-border deliveries of goods and services, tax risks related to acquisitions and divestments, tax risks related to permanent establishments, tax risks relating to tax loss, interest and tax credits carried forward, and potential changes in tax law that could result in higher tax expenses and payments. The risks may have a significant impact on local financial tax results, which, in turn, could adversely affect Philips' financial condition and operating results. The value of the deferred tax assets, such as tax losses carried forward, is subject to the availability of sufficient taxable income within the tax loss-carry-forward period, but also to the availability of sufficient taxable income within the foreseeable future in the case of tax losses carried forward with an indefinite carry-forward period. The ultimate realization of the company's deferred tax assets is uncertain. Accordingly, there can be no absolute assurance that all deferred tax assets, such as (net) tax losses and credits carried forward, will be realized.\n\nRisk response: Philips' tax policy, strategy and planning provides overarching governance. The global Philips tax organization designs and implements this and provides tax advice, ensures tax compliance, including accounting and reporting, and deploys our tax risk management and control framework to ensure adherence to up-to-date tax policies. The Group Tax department is in charge of establishing, maintaining and overseeing the tax policies. Potential risks are carefully monitored and dealt with by tax specialists from relevant areas (e.g. corporate income tax, transfer pricing, VAT, wage tax and tax accounting). A group of Market Tax Managers supports managing the risks and overall tax governance by applying their knowledge of local markets (e.g. introduction of new tax law), among others in monthly reviews.\n\nPlease also refer to the disclosure Income taxes, starting on page 155 and the Country Activity and Tax Report.\n\n## Philips has defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans in several countries. The funded status and service cost are influenced by movements in financial markets and demographic developments.\n\nA significant proportion of (former) employees in Europe and North and Latin America are covered by defined-benefit pension plans and other post-retirement plans. The accounting for such plans requires management to make estimates on assumptions such as discount rates, inflation, longevity, expected cost of medical care and expected rates of compensation. Changes in these assumptions (e.g. due to movements in financial markets) can have a significant impact on the Defined Benefit Obligation and net interest cost.\n\nRisk response: Philips has defined a Long-Term Employee Benefits (LTEB) Policy to ensure careful management and monitoring of long-term employee benefits. Philips has an active de-risking strategy, in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its defined benefit plans.\n\nThe policy and strategy are managed and monitored by the LTEB Committee, chaired by the Group CFO. Regular reviews include the funded status of LTEB plans, execution of approved funding proposals, new plans and plan changes, compliance with the LTEB Policy, the implementation of an adequate and appropriate LTEB governance structure and risk/control matrix, potential SOX compliance issues for LTEB plans, key Risk Indicators and risk mitigating actions.\n\nPlease also refer to Post-employment benefits, starting on page 179.\n\n## Flaws in internal controls could adversely affect our financial reporting and management process.\n\nAccurate disclosures provide investors and other market professionals with significant information for a better understanding of Philips' businesses. Failures in internal controls or other issues with respect to Philips' public disclosures, including disclosures with respect to cybersecurity risks and incidents, could create market uncertainty regarding the reliability of the information (including financial data) presented and could have a negative impact on the price of Philips securities. In addition, the reliability of revenue and expenditure data is key for steering the businesses and for managing top-line and bottom-line growth. The long lifecycle of health technology solution sales, from order acceptance to accepted installation and servicing, together with the complexity of the accounting rules for when revenue can be recognized in the accounts, presents a challenge in terms of ensuring consistent and correct application of the accounting rules throughout Philips' global business. Significant changes in the way of working, such as working from home during a pandemic, may have an adverse impact on the control environment under which controls are executed, monitored, reviewed and tested. Any flaws in internal controls, or regulatory or investor actions in connection with flaws in internal controls, could adversely affect Philips' financial condition, results of operation, reputation and brand.\n\nRisk response: Philips has adopted a Financial Code of Ethics to deter wrongdoings and to promote honest and ethical conduct, full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosures, and internal reporting of (suspected) violations. Philips' Business Control Framework (PBCF) sets the standard for risk management and internal control over financial reporting, including management self-assessments against our Internal Control Standard (ICS).\n\nPlease also refer to the Our approach to risk management, starting on page 74 section for more information on our PBCF.",

At its Capital Markets Day with investors and financial analysts in November 2020, the company outlined its strategic plan and performance trajectory for the 2021-2025 period.\n\nIn 2020, Philips demonstrated both resilience and agility in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the healthcare and economic challenges it unleashed. The company's achievements in reconfiguring supply chains, scaling up production and developing new ways of engaging with customers and employees ensured it was able to deliver against its triple duty of care - meeting critical customer needs, safeguarding the health and safety of its employees, and ensuring business continuity.\n\n## Strategy working\n\nThe events of 2020 validate Philips' strategy to become the leading provider of health technology and to advance value-based care along the health continuum. Over the past years, Philips has significantly invested in informatics, data science and cloud technology to enable the delivery of integrated solutions across the health continuum and across care settings through telehealth. Philips' innovations - supporting personal health, precision diagnosis, image-guided therapies and connected care, and leveraging the power of data and informatics - and its strong focus on customer needs continue to generate a growing proportion of solutionsbased sales. It is an approach that is resonating more strongly than ever with customers and investors.\n\n## ESG commitments\n\nIn 2020, Philips continued to reinforce its leadership as a purpose-driven company with the announcement of a fully integrated approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably. Building on the company's strong heritage in environmental and social responsibility, this framework comprises a comprehensive set of key commitments across the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dimensions that guide execution of the company's strategy. I share management's conviction that this approach is the best way for Philips to create superior, long-term value for its multiple stakeholders.\n\n## Financial performance and outlook\n\nDespite the challenging circumstances, Philips was able to execute its plans and return to growth and improved profitability in the second half of 2020. This was driven by the successful conversion of a strong order book and a gradual return of consumer demand. Philips continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity position throughout the period. Nevertheless, in view of the likely\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board spent several sessions in 2020 reviewing, among other things, Philips' COVID-19 response, performance, strategy, talent pipeline, business controls, quality, and sustainability programs.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in April 2020, the Supervisory Board was further strengthened by the addition of Feike Sijbesma and Peter L\u00f6scher. Feike Sijbesma is a recognized business and sustainability leader, while Peter L\u00f6scher is a seasoned business leader in the medical technology and pharmaceutical industries. Their outstanding experience will be highly valuable to our Board and to Philips, as the company expands its leadership in health technology solutions.\n\nWe are also very pleased to propose Indra Nooyi and Chua Sock Koong as new members of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, which will be held on May 6, 2021. Indra Nooyi is a proven business leader in the consumer and technology sectors, with a strong track record of delivering sustained profitable growth in a sustainable and responsible way. Chua Sock Koong has deep knowledge of information technologies and digitalization. She is the former CEO of Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel), Asia's leading communications technology group. Their strategic insights will be of great value to Philips, as the company embarks on its next growth phase as a health technology leader.\n\nI consider it a privilege to have served three terms on the Supervisory Board of Philips, of which ten years as Chairman. When I step down at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2021, I will hand over the reins to my successor, Feike Sijbesma. Together with our colleagues on the Supervisory Board, he will continue to provide thorough oversight of the company as it delivers on its purpose of improving people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation.\n\n## Jeroen van der Veer\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board",

        "page_content": "## 8 Supervisory Board report\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings and attendance\n\nIn 2020, the members of the Supervisory Board convened for seven regular meetings and three extraordinary meetings. Moreover, we collectively and individually interacted with members of the Executive Committee and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the CEO met regularly for bilateral discussions about the company's progress on a variety of matters. Feike Sijbesma and Peter L\u00f6scher, appointed to the Supervisory Board with effect from April 30, 2020, followed an induction program and interacted with various Executive Committee members for deep-dives on strategy, finance and investor relations, governance and legal affairs.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meetings were well attended in 2020. All Supervisory Board members were present during the Supervisory Board meetings in 2020, with the exception of one member not able to attend the April 2020 meeting. The committees of the Supervisory Board also convened regularly (see the separate reports of the committees below) and the committees reported back on their activities to the full Supervisory Board. In addition to the formal meetings of the Board and its committees, the Board members held private meetings. We, as members of the Supervisory Board, devoted sufficient time to engage (proactively if the circumstances so required) in our supervisory responsibilities.\n\nBecause of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees were mostly held virtually and no local site visits were organized.\n\n## Composition, diversity and self-evaluation by the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board is a separate corporate body that is independent of the Board of Management and the company. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. The Supervisory Board considers all its members to be independent under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Furthermore, the members of its Audit Committee are independent under the applicable US rules.\n\nThe Supervisory Board currently consists of ten members. In 2020, there were a number of changes to the composition of the Board. At the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Neelam Dhawan was re-appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board for an additional term of two years and Feike Sijbesma and Peter L\u00f6scher were each appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board for a term of four years. The agenda for the upcoming 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will include proposals to appoint Indra Nooyi and Chua Sock Koong as members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe term of appointment of Jeroen van der Veer and Christine Poon will expire at the end of the 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, after each having served three consecutive terms on the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, Orit Gadiesh will step down from the Supervisory Board at the end of the 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, after having served seven years on the Supervisory Board. We, as members of the Supervisory Board, would like to take this opportunity to thank Jeroen van der Veer, Christine Poon and Orit Gadiesh for their contributions to our work. After an internal selection process, the Supervisory Board appointed Feike Sijbesma as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, succeeding Jeroen van der Veer, and Paul Stoffels as Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board, succeeding Christine Poon and Feike Sijbesma. Both appointments will be effective as per the end of the 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe Supervisory Board attaches great value to diversity in its composition and adopted a Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee. As laid down in the Diversity Policy, the aim is that the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee comprise members with a European and a non-European background (nationality, working experience or otherwise) and overall at least four different nationalities, and that they comprise at least 30% male and at least 30% female members. The Supervisory Board's composition furthermore follows the profile included in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among its members, encompassing marketing, manufacturing, technology and informatics, healthcare, financial, economic, social and legal aspects of international business and government and public administration in relation to the global and multiproduct character of Philips' businesses. The aim is also to have one or more members with an executive or similar position in business or society no longer than five years ago. The composition of the Supervisory Board shall be in accordance with the best practice provisions on independence of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, and each member of the Supervisory Board shall be capable of assessing the broad outline of the overall policy of the company. The size of the Supervisory Board may vary as it considers appropriate to support its profile.\n\nThe Supervisory Board spent time in 2020 considering its composition, as well as the composition of the Executive Committee (including the Board of Management). Currently, the composition of the Supervisory Board meets the above-mentioned gender diversity goals, as 40% of the Supervisory Board members (4 out of 10) are female. Overall, 28% (7 out of 25) of the positions to which the Diversity Policy applies (Supervisory Board and Executive Committee/ Board of Management) are held by women. As explained in the report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination and Selection Committee, the company continues its efforts to enhance inclusion and diversity in the entire organization. The Supervisory Board expects these efforts to contribute to the achievement of",

The Supervisory Board will continue to devote attention to this topic in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, each member of the Supervisory Board completed a questionnaire to verify compliance with the applicable corporate governance rules and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board. The outcome of this survey was satisfactory.\n\nAn independent external party facilitated the 2020 self-evaluation process for the Supervisory Board and its committees. This included drafting the relevant questionnaire and interviewing members of the Supervisory Board as well as reporting on the results. The questionnaire covered topics such as the composition of the Supervisory Board and the required profile of future Supervisory Board members, stakeholder oversight, strategic oversight, risk management, dynamics of Supervisory Board meetings, succession planning and human resources oversight, the relationship between the Supervisory Board and Management and the priorities of the Supervisory Board in 2021. Furthermore, the performance of the Supervisory Board's committees was reviewed. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board was evaluated through a separate questionnaire and his evaluation was also part of the discussions of the Supervisory Board about the selection of the new Chairman. The responses to the questionnaires were aggregated into reports.\n\nThe results of the self-evaluation were shared and discussed in a private meeting of the Supervisory Board. The responses provided by the Supervisory Board members indicated that the Board continues to be a well-functioning team. A number of suggestions were made to further improve the performance of the Supervisory Board over the coming period, with the top priorities being: a smooth transition of the Chair when Jeroen van der Veer steps down from the Supervisory Board, oversight of technology and innovation, the balance between organic and inorganic growth and the oversight of the CEO succession. The functioning of the Supervisory Board committees was rated highly. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board held bilateral meetings early 2021 where the results were also discussed.\n\nThe periodic use of an external facilitator to measure the functioning of the Supervisory Board will continue to be considered in the future.",

We have approved these financial statements, and all individual members of the Supervisory Board have signed these documents (as did the members of the Board of Management).\n\nWe recommend to shareholders that they adopt the 2020 financial statements. We likewise recommend to shareholders that they adopt the proposal of the Board of Management to make a distribution of EUR 0.85 per common share, in cash or shares at the option of the shareholder, against the net income of 2020.\n\nFinally, we would like to express our thanks to the members of the Board of Management, the Executive Committee and all other employees for their continued contribution throughout 2020.\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\nThe Supervisory Board\n\nJeroen van der Veer Christine Poon Feike Sijbesma Neelam Dhawan Liz Doherty Orit Gadiesh Marc Harrison Peter L\u00f6scher David Pyott Paul Stoffels\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and the internal regulations and procedures governing its functioning and that of its committees, please refer to Corporate governance, starting on page 110 and to the following documents published on the company's website:\n\n- \u00b7 Articles of Association\n- \u00b7 Rules of Procedure Supervisory Board, including the Charters of the Board committees\n- \u00b7 Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee\n\n## Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee 8.1\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee is chaired by Jeroen van der Veer. Its other members are Christine Poon and Feike Sijbesma (who joined in the course of 2020). The Committee is responsible for the review of selection criteria and appointment procedures for the Board of Management, the Executive Committee, certain other key management positions, as well as the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn 2020, Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee members held six meetings and all Committee members attended these meetings.\n\nThe Committee devoted time to the appointment or reappointment of candidates to fill current and future vacancies on the Supervisory Board. Following those consultations, it prepared decisions and advised the Supervisory Board on candidates for appointment. This resulted in the re-appointment of Neelam Dhawan and the appointment of Feike Sijbesma and Peter L\u00f6scher as members of the Supervisory Board at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. This also resulted in the proposals to appoint Indra Nooyi and Chua Sock Koong as members of the Supervisory Board, at the upcoming 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nUnder its responsibility for the selection criteria and appointment procedures for Philips' senior management, the Committee reviewed the functioning of the Board of Management and its individual members, the Executive Committee succession plans and emergency candidates for key roles in the company. The conclusions from these reviews were taken into account in the performance evaluation of the Board of Management and Executive Committee members and the selection of succession candidates.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee devoted time to the appointment or reappointment of candidates to fill current and future vacancies on the Board of Management and the Executive Committee.

Henk de Jong transitioned to the role of CEO of the Domestic Appliances business (which is currently being separated from Philips) and remains a member of the Executive Committee. Furthermore, this resulted in the proposal to re-appoint Marnix van Ginneken as member of the Board of Management at the 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nWith respect to corporate governance matters, the Committee discussed relevant developments and legislative changes, including pending or expected Dutch legislation on takeovers and shareholder activism and on gender diversity.\n\n## Diversity\n\nIn 2017, the Supervisory Board adopted a Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee, which is published on the company website.\n\nThe criteria in the Diversity Policy aim to ensure that the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee have the expertise needed for a good understanding of current affairs and longer-term risks and opportunities related to the company's business and sufficient diversity of views to provide appropriate challenge. The nature and complexity of the company's business is taken into account when assessing optimal board diversity, as well as the social and environmental context in which the company operates.\n\nPursuant to the Diversity Policy, the selection of candidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee will be based on merit. With due regard to the above, the company shall seek to fill vacancies by considering candidates that bring a diversity of (amongst others) age, gender and educational and professional backgrounds.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's aim is that the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee comprise members with a European and a nonEuropean background (nationality, working experience or otherwise) and overall at least four different nationalities, and that they comprise at least 30% male and at least 30% female members.\n\nCurrently, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management/Executive Committee comprise members with more than 10 different nationalities. The composition of the Supervisory Board currently meets the above-mentioned\n\ngender diversity goals, with 40% of the Supervisory Board members (4 out of 10) being female. Overall, 28% (7 out of 25) of the positions to which the Diversity Policy applies (Supervisory Board and Executive Committee/Board of Management) are currently held by women.\n\nThe company continues to put in place measures to enhance diversity and inclusion at all levels within the organization, with the aim of retaining and progressing talent and of ensuring diversity and inclusion at senior management levels. To this end, Philips has set a new goal of 30% gender diversity in senior leadership positions by the end of 2025. With diversity being part of Philips' purpose and one of the three strategic pillars of the global Human Resources strategy, long-term Inclusion & Diversity ambitions are embedded in that strategy. Execution is monitored through a diversity dashboard that is based on a global scorecard with specific goals, but also provides insights into the inflow, advancement and outflow of talent. This ensures clarity, accountability and focus and makes it possible to customize goals and intervene where appropriate. During 2020, further work was done to bring together various initiatives around unconscious bias, health, well-being and identity, to stand up against racism and to drive an ongoing dialogue about inclusion within teams across the company. These initiatives create a more holistic approach and include:\n\n- \u00b7 Building senior women mentoring programs to develop and retain senior female leaders;\n- \u00b7 Continuing Philips' senior women-focused employer brand campaign;\n- \u00b7 The global and local celebration of International Women's Day across 80 locations worldwide;\n- \u00b7 Including questions about diversity and inclusion in employee surveys. Results from recent surveys show positive trends, with all employees across all grades becoming more positive about Philips' commitment to diversity in its widest sense, including background, talent and perspective as well as gender;\n- \u00b7 Continuing the deployment, started in 2019, across the organization of tailormade training designed to address unconscious bias. The training creates awareness of, and an ongoing dialogue around, unconscious bias and its impact on inclusion;\n- \u00b7 Increased focus on health and well-being in view of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, for example, the establishment of an Employee Assistance Program offering counselling support in a number of countries;\n- \u00b7 The launch of a global Energy Management Program, addressing work-life balance and helping employees to build resilience;\n- \u00b7 Offering active support to employees in setting up their own diverse and inclusive bottom-up networks in the organization. These include women's networks, the Black Employees Resource Group that was founded in North America, an Asian employees' network, and revival of the LGBTQ+ community, with the leaders of such networks and communities frequently coming together to ensure an integrated Inclusion & Diversity approach;",

Reference is also made to the section Inclusion & Diversity, starting on page 55 of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## Report of the Remuneration Committee 8.2\n\n## Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair 8.2.1\n\n## Dear Stakeholder,\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to report on the Committee's activities in 2020 and to present the 2020 Remuneration Report on behalf of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nAn important milestone in 2020 was the update of the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board respectively, as approved by our shareholders during the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The relevant proposals followed the implementation of the revised EU Shareholders Rights Directive (2017/828) into Dutch law (effective December 2019). To ensure that the Remuneration Committee was able to properly consider all feedback before submitting final remuneration packages to our shareholders, the Remuneration Committee initiated a dedicated remuneration roadshow in the second half of 2019, engaging with a number of the company's shareholders (in aggregate representing approximately 35% of the issued share capital) and institutional advisory organizations.\n\nAs part of the update of the Remuneration Policy and the Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Board of Management, the following changes were made (compared to the previous 2017 versions):\n\n- \u00b7 Long-Term Incentive - to explicitly link the Remuneration Policy to our purpose and our contribution to society, a sustainability criterion (nonfinancial) has been introduced in the Long-Term Incentive in addition to the financial criteria TSR and EPS. In addition, the TSR vesting schedule has been changed, reducing pay-out at and around median performance.\n- \u00b7 Annual Incentive (individual element) - to enhance transparency, five performance categories have been defined for the individual element of the Annual Incentive (20% weighting). Each year, relevant categories will be chosen and disclosed ex-ante in the Annual Report. Related targets will be set for each of the members of the Board of Management.\n- \u00b7 Quantum Peer Group - the Quantum Peer Group for compensation benchmarking purposes changed from 26 to 24 companies. Alcatel Lucent was excluded as it was acquired by Nokia (which was already included in the Quantum Peer Group), and Essilor International was excluded after its merger into a company with a business profile with less relevance for Philips.\n\nDuring the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the 2019 Remuneration Report (by a 92.06% for vote). Based on our shareholder engagement, we noted the request for an increased level of transparency in the Remuneration Report, and therefore we further increased disclosures in our 2020 Remuneration Report. For example, we have updated the annual incentive disclosure tables, showing the realized financial performance, the selected individual performance criteria and the assessment of performance for the individual targets of the 2020 annual incentive. During its regular meetings throughout the year, the Remuneration Committee obtained updates on remuneration-related developments and societal trends. Overall, the Remuneration Committee concluded that our Remuneration Policy and its implementation are well aligned with market practice and the prevailing corporate governance requirements, while it enables us to achieve alignment of the remuneration of the Board of Management with Philips' purpose and strategy.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19\n\nAs highlighted in the letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board within Supervisory Board report, starting on page 87, Philips demonstrated resilience and agility in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the healthcare and economic challenges it unleashed. The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the measures the company took in the first half of 2020 to further enhance its liquidity position, in view of the possible continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of these measures, the 2019 Annual Incentive for the Board of Management was paid out in shares, which will be subject to the 5-year holding period as prescribed by the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Group-wide, merit and promotional salary increases for senior management were delayed from April 1, 2020 to October 1, 2020.\n\nLooking back, the Remuneration Committee acknowledges that COVID-19 has impacted Philips' results in the year. Demand for our professional healthcare products and solutions to help diagnose, treat, monitor and manage COVID-19 patients increased strongly. At the same time, COVID-19 led to the postponement of installations and elective procedures in hospitals, which impacted parts of our business, and there was a decline in consumer activity, as a result of which our",

In addition to these changes, in view of Philips' planned portfolio change through the divestment of its Domestic Appliances business, the Supervisory Board may decide to remove Groupe SEB and De'Longhi from the TSR Performance Peer Group and replace them by other business competitors in the health technology market. No changes were made to either peer group during 2020.\n\n## Services agreements\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are engaged by means of a services agreement ( overeenkomst van opdracht ). Termination of the contract by either party is subject to six months' notice period. The severance payment is set at a maximum of one year's annual base compensation. No severance payment is due if the agreement is terminated early on behalf of the Board of Management member or in the case of urgent cause ( dringende reden ) as defined in article\n\n7:678 and further in the Dutch Civil Code. The term of the services agreement is aligned with the term for which the relevant member has been appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (which is a maximum period of four years, it being understood that this period expires no later than at the end of the AGM held in the fourth year after the year of appointment).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Contract terms for current members 2020\n\n|                      | end of term   |\n|----------------------|---------------|\n| Frans van Houten     | AGM 2023      |\n| Abhijit Bhattacharya | AGM 2023      |\n| Marnix van Ginneken  | AGM 2021      |\n\n## Remuneration of the Board of Management in 2020 8.2.3\n\nThe Supervisory Board has determined the 2020 pay-outs and awards to the members of the Board of Management, upon the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and Long-Term Incentive Plan as adopted and approved respectively by our shareholders during the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, the Supervisory Board has determined the 2020 pay-out of the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan, of which the performance period ended on December 31, 2020. This was done in accordance with the Long-Term Incentive Plan as approved during the 2017 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee annually conducts a scenario analysis. This includes the calculation of remuneration under different scenarios, whereby different Philips performance assumptions and corporate actions are examined. The Supervisory Board concluded that the relationship between the strategic objectives and the chosen performance criteria for the 2020 Annual Incentive, as well as 2018 Long-Term Incentive performance criteria, were adequate.\n\n## Annual Base Compensation\n\nThe annual compensation of the members of the Board of Management has been reviewed as part of the regular remuneration review. In the case of Frans van Houten and Abhijit Bhattacharya, the annual compensation remained unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019 at EUR 1,325,000 and EUR 785,000 respectively. As a result of the review, the annual compensation of Marnix van Ginneken has been increased per October 1, 2020, from EUR 575,000 to EUR 595,000. This increase was made to move the total compensation level closer to the market median level, as well as to reflect internal relativities. Typically, the salary increase is implemented on April 1, however all merit and promotional salary increases for senior management globally were delayed from April 1, 2020 to October 1, 2020.",

The payout results are explained below.\n\n## TSR (50% weighting)\n\nA ranking approach to TSR applies with Philips itself included in the TSR Performance Peer Group. TSR scores are calculated based on a local currency approach and by taking a 3-month averaging period prior to the start and end of the 3-year performance period. The performance incentive pay-out zone is outlined in the following table, which results in zero vesting for performance below the 40th percentile and 200% vesting for performance levels above the 75th percentile. The incentive zone range has been constructed such that the average pay-out over time is expected to be approximately 100%.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Performance-incentive zone for TSR in %\n\n| Position   |   20-14 |   13 |   12 |   11 |   10 |   9 |   8 |   7 |   6 |   5-1 |\n|------------|---------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Payout     |       0 |   60 |   80 |  100 |  120 | 140 | 160 | 180 | 190 |   200 |\n\nThe TSR achieved by Philips during the performance period was 35.03%, using a start date of October 2017 and end date of December 2020. This resulted in Philips being positioned at rank 9 in the TSR performance peer group shown in the following table, resulting in a TSR achievement of 140%.",

Furthermore, the Supervisory Board has also deemed it appropriate to make adjustments relating to certain other items that were not contemplated when the targets were set in 2018. These relate to the profit and loss impact of acquisitions and divestitures, impact of foreign exchange variations versus plan and profit and loss impact of legal cases and pension derisking. The sum of these adjustments increased the achieved LTI Plan EPS by\n\nEUR 0.16. The resulting LTI Plan EPS achievement was determined by the Supervisory Board as 110%.\n\nIn view of the above, the following performance achievement and vesting levels have been determined by the Supervisory Board in respect of the 2018 grant of performance shares:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Performance achievement and vesting levels\n\n|       | achievement   | weighting   | vesting level   |\n|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| TSR   | 140%          | 50%         | 70%             |\n| EPS   | 110%          | 50%         | 55%             |\n| Total |               |             | 125%            |\n\n## 2021 Long-Term Incentive\n\nThe vesting of the 2021 Long-Term Incentive grant consisting of performance shares is subject to performance over a period of 3 years and based on two financial criteria and one non-financial criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 50% weighting: Relative Total Shareholder Return ('TSR')\n- \u00b7 40% weighting: Adjusted Earnings per Share growth ('EPS')\n- \u00b7 10% weighting: Sustainability objectives\n\nPlease refer to the Long-Term Incentive Plan published on the company's website for more information.\n\n## Pension\n\nThe following pension arrangement is in place for the members of the Board of Management working under a Dutch contract:\n\n- \u00b7 Flex ES Pension Plan in the Netherlands, which is a Collective Defined Contribution plan with a fixed contribution of (currently) 30.3% (including an own contribution of 2%) of the maximum pensionable salary of EUR 110,111 (effective January 1, 2020) minus the offset. The Flex ES Plan has a target retirement age of 68 and a target accrual rate of 1.85%;\n- \u00b7 A gross Pension Allowance equal to 25% of the base compensation exceeding EUR 110,111;\n- \u00b7 A temporary gross Transition Allowance, for a maximum period of 8 years (first 5 years in full; year 6: 75%; year 7: 50%, year 8: 25%) for members of the Board of Management who were participants of the former Executive Pension Plan. The level of the allowance is based on the age and salary of the Board member on December 31, 2014.",

The fee levels in this Remuneration Policy are the same as the Supervisory Board fee levels as determined by our shareholders at the 2018 Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe overarching objective of the 2020 Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board is to enable its members to fulfill their duties, acting independently: supervising the policies and management and the general affairs of Philips, and supporting the Board of Management and the Executive Committee with advice. Also, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the company's longterm interests, with due observance of the company's purpose and strategy, taking into account the interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders.\n\nTo support the objectives mentioned above, the 2020 Remuneration Policy is aimed at attracting and retaining international Supervisory Board members of the highest caliber and with experience and expertise relevant to our health technology businesses.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board is not dependent on the results of the company and does not include any shares (or rights to shares). Members of the Supervisory Board may only hold shares in the company for the purpose of longterm investment and must refrain from short-term transactions in Philips securities. The company does not grant personal loans to members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews fee levels in principle every three years in order to monitor and take account of market developments and manage expectations of our key stakeholders. The levels are aimed at broadly median market levels (and around the 25th percentile market level for the Chairman) paid in the Quantum Peer Group (as used in the 2020 Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Remuneration Supervisory Board in EUR 2020\n\n|                                                           | Chair                  | Vice Chair             | Member   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|\n| Supervisory Board                                         | 155,000                | 115,000                | 100,000  |\n| Audit Committee                                           | 27,000                 | n.a.                   | 18,000   |\n| Remuneration Committee                                    | 21,000                 | n.a.                   | 14,000   |\n| Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee | 21,000                 | n.a.                   | 14,000   |\n| Quality & Regulatory Committee                            | 21,000                 | n.a.                   | 14,000   |\n| Attendance fee per inter- European trip                   | 2,500                  | 2,500                  | 2,500    |\n| Attendance fee per intercontinental trip                  | 5,000                  | 5,000                  | 5,000    |\n| Entitlement to Philips product arrangement                | 2,000                  | 2,000                  | 2,000    |\n| Annual fixed net expense allowance                        | 11,345                 | 2,269                  | 2,269    |\n| Other travel expenses                                     | As reasonably incurred | As reasonably incurred |          |\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board benefit from coverage under the company's Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance.\n\n## Remuneration of the Supervisory Board in 2020\n\nThe individual members of the Supervisory Board received, by virtue of the positions they held, the following remuneration in 2020:",

Its shares have been listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange (Euronext Amsterdam) since 1912. Furthermore, its shares have been traded in the United States since 1962 and have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1987.\n\nRoyal Philips has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board, each of which is accountable to the General Meeting of Shareholders for the fulfillment of its respective duties.\n\nThe company is governed by Dutch corporate and securities laws, its Articles of Association, and the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and of the Supervisory Board respectively. Its corporate governance framework is also based on the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (dated December 8, 2016) and US laws and regulations applicable to Foreign Private Issuers. Additionally, the Board of Management has implemented the Philips General Business Principles (GBP) and underlying policies, as well as separate codes of ethics that apply to employees working in specific areas of our business, i.e. the Financial Code of Ethics and the Procurement Code of Ethics. Many of the documents referred to are published on the company's website and more information can be found in Our approach to risk management, starting on page 74.\n\nIn this section of the Annual Report, the company addresses the main elements of its corporate governance structure, reports on how it applies the principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and provides the information required by the Dutch governmental Decree on Corporate Governance ( Besluit inhoud bestuursverslag ) and governmental Decree on Article 10 Takeover Directive ( Besluit artikel 10 overnamerichtlijn ). When deemed necessary in the interests of the company, the company may deviate from aspects of the company's corporate governance structure, and any such deviations will be disclosed in the company's corporate governance report.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, other parts of the management report (within the meaning of section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code) included in the Annual Report address the strategy and culture of Philips aimed at long-term value creation. Philips' strategy is described in more detail in Strategy and Businesses, starting on page 9. Here, reference is also made to the Philips Business System, an interdependent, collaborative operating model that covers all\n\naspects of how we operate - strategy, governance, processes, people, culture and performance management. As set out in Social performance, starting on page 54, Philips promotes a behavior and competency-driven growth and performance culture, which is anchored by the integrity norms described in the GBP. The Message from the CEO, starting on page 4 explains how the company's strategy was executed in 2020; in this regard, please refer also to Financial performance, starting on page 26.\n\n## Board of Management and Executive Committee 9.2\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. Certain key officers have been appointed to support the Board of Management in the fulfilment of its managerial duties. The members of the Board of Management and these key officers together constitute the Executive Committee. In this Corporate Governance report, wherever the Executive Committee is mentioned, this also includes the members of the Board of Management, unless the context requires otherwise. Please refer to Board of Management and Executive Committee, starting on page 7 for an overview of the current members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee.\n\nUnder the chairmanship of the President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and supported by the other members of the Executive Committee, the members of the Board of Management drive the company's management agenda and share responsibility for the continuity of the Philips group, focusing on long-term value creation. Please refer to the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee, which are published on the company's website, for a description of further responsibilities and tasks, as well as procedures for meetings, resolutions and minutes.\n\nIn fulfilling their duties, the members of the Board of Management and Executive Committee shall be guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprise, taking into account the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board of Management and the Executive Committee have adopted a division of responsibilities based on the functional and business areas, each of which is monitored and reviewed by the individual members. The Board of Management is accountable for the actions and decisions of the Executive",

Members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee will be present in the meetings of the Supervisory Board if so invited. In addition, the CEO and other members of the Board of Management (and if needed, the other members of the Executive Committee) meet on a regular basis with the Chairman and other members of the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management and the Executive Committee are required to keep the Supervisory Board informed of all facts and developments concerning Philips that the Supervisory Board may need to be aware of in order to function as required and to properly carry out its duties.\n\nCertain important decisions of the Board of Management require Supervisory Board approval, including decisions concerning the operational and financial objectives of the company and the strategy designed to achieve these objectives, the issue, repurchase or cancellation of shares, and major acquisitions or divestments.\n\n## Appointment and composition\n\nMembers of the Board of Management, including the CEO, are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders upon a binding recommendation drawn up by the Supervisory Board after consultation with the CEO. This binding recommendation may be overruled by a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast and representing at least one-third of the issued share capital. If a simple majority of the votes cast is in favor of the resolution to overrule the binding recommendation, but such majority does not represent at least one-third of the issued share capital, a new meeting may be convened, at which the resolution may be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, regardless of the portion of the issued share capital represented by such majority. In the event that a binding recommendation has been overruled, a new binding recommendation shall be submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders. If such second binding recommendation has been overruled, the General Meeting of Shareholders shall be free to appoint a board member.\n\nThe CEO and the other members of the Board of Management are appointed for a term of four years, it being understood that this term expires at the closing of the General Meeting of Shareholders to be held in the fourth calendar year after the year of their appointment or, if applicable, at a later retirement date or other contractual termination date in the fourth year, unless the General Meeting of Shareholders resolves otherwise. The same applies in the case of re-appointment, which is possible for consecutive terms of four years. A (re-)appointment schedule for the Board of Management is published on the company's website.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the members of the Board of Management are engaged by means of a services agreement ( overeenkomst van opdracht ). The term of the services agreement is aligned with the term for which the relevant member has been appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. In case of termination of the services agreement by the company, severance payment is limited to a maximum of one year's base salary. The services agreements provide no additional termination benefits.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and by the General Meeting of Shareholders and members of the Board of Management may be dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (in each case in accordance with the Articles of Association). The other members of the Executive Committee are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the CEO, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board 9.3\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of Philips, and assists the Board of Management and the Executive Committee with advice on general policies related to the activities of the company. In fulfilling their duties, the members of the Supervisory Board shall be guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprise, taking into account the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nIn the two-tier corporate structure under Dutch law, the Supervisory Board is a separate body that is independent of the Board of Management and the company. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. The Supervisory Board considers all its members to be independent under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Furthermore, the members of its Audit Committee are independent under the applicable US rules.\n\nThe Supervisory Board must approve certain important decisions of the Board of Management, including decisions concerning the operational and financial objectives of the company and the strategy designed to achieve these objectives, the issue, repurchase or cancellation of shares and major acquisitions or divestments. The Supervisory Board and its individual members each have a responsibility to request from the Board of Management, the Executive Committee and the external auditor all information that the Supervisory Board needs in order to be able to carry out its duties properly as a supervisory body.",

Please refer to Supervisory Board report, starting on page 87. Please also refer to Supervisory Board, starting on page 85 for an overview of the current members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Appointment and composition\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders upon a binding recommendation drawn up by the Supervisory Board. This binding recommendation may be overruled by a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast and representing at least one-third of the issued share capital. If a simple majority of the votes cast is in favor of the resolution to overrule the binding recommendation, but such majority does not represent at least one-third of the issued share capital, a new meeting may be convened.

There is no age limit requiring the retirement of board members.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, members of the Supervisory Board are eligible for re-appointment for a fixed term of four years once, and may subsequently be re-appointed for a period of two years, which appointment may be extended by at most two years. The report of the Supervisory Board must state the reasons for any re-appointment beyond an eight-year period. A (re)appointment schedule for the Supervisory Board is published on the company's website.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board may be suspended or dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the Articles of Association.\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board are selected taking into account the company's Diversity Policy, which is published on the company's website. The Supervisory Board's composition furthermore follows the profile included in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, and the size of the board may vary as it considers appropriate to support its profile. Please refer to Composition, diversity and self-evaluation by the Supervisory Board, starting on page 85.\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board, while retaining overall responsibility, has assigned certain tasks to four committees: the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Quality & Regulatory Committee. Each committee reports to the full Supervisory Board. Please refer to the charters of the respective committees, which are published on the company's website as part of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, for a description of their responsibilities, composition, meetings and working procedures.\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee is responsible for preparing selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The Committee makes proposals to the Supervisory Board for the (re)appointment of such members, and periodically assesses their functioning. The Committee also periodically assesses the Diversity Policy, and supervises the policy of the Executive Committee on the selection criteria and appointment procedures for Philips executives. At least once a year, the Committee reviews the corporate governance principles applicable to the company, and advises the Supervisory Board on any changes to these principles that it deems appropriate.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing decisions of the Supervisory Board on the remuneration of individual members of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The Committee prepares an annual remuneration report, which is included in the Annual Report. In performing its duties and responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external consultant and an in-house remuneration expert acting on the basis of a protocol to ensure that the expert acts on the instructions of the Remuneration Committee and on an independent basis in which conflicts of interest are avoided.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for: the integrity of the company's financial statements; the financial reporting process; the effectiveness (also in respect of the financial reporting process) of the system of internal controls and risk management; the internal and external audit process; the internal and external auditor's qualifications, independence and performance; as well as the company's process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations and the GBP (including",

It reviews the company's annual and interim financial statements, including non-financial information, prior to publication and advises the Supervisory Board on the adequacy and appropriateness of internal control policies and internal audit programs and their findings. The Committee furthermore supervises the internal audit function, maintains contact with and supervises the external auditor and prepares the nomination of the external auditor for appointment by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe composition of the Audit Committee meets the relevant requirements under Dutch law and the applicable US rules. All of the members are considered to be independent and financially literate and the Audit Committee as a whole has the competence relevant to the sector in which the company is operating. In addition, David Pyott and Elizabeth Doherty are each designated as an Audit Committee financial expert, as defined under the regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Supervisory Board considers the expertise and experience available in the Audit Committee, in conjunction with the possibility to take advice from internal and external experts and advisors, to be sufficient for the fulfillment of the tasks and responsibilities of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Quality & Regulatory Committee has been established by the Supervisory Board in view of the central importance of the quality of the company's products, systems, services and software as well as the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing thereof, and the regulatory requirements relating thereto. The Quality & Regulatory Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in this area, whilst recognizing that the Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in its oversight of other areas of regulatory, compliance and legal matters.\n\n## Other Board-related matters 9.4\n\n## Remuneration and share ownership\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board, taking into account the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board is determined by the General Meeting of Shareholders, also on the basis of a remuneration policy.\n\nThe current remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, respectively, were adopted in 2020 and are published on the company's website. A description of the composition of the remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is included in Report of the Remuneration Committee, starting on page 94.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the shareholders are entitled to vote on the adoption of the remuneration policies for each of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting (at least) every four years. The adoption of a remuneration policy will require a special majority of three-quarters of the votes cast (as the Articles of Association do not allow a lower majority). In addition, shareholders have an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on the remuneration report relating to the preceding financial year (as prepared by the Remuneration Committee and included in the Annual Report). The relevant item will be included in the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders 2021.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the Supervisory Board is authorized to reduce or eliminate unpaid bonuses awarded to members of the Board of Management if payment or delivery of the bonus would be unacceptable according to the principles of reasonableness and fairness. The company, which in this respect may also be represented by the Supervisory Board or a special representative appointed for this purpose by the General Meeting of Shareholders, may also request return of bonuses already paid or delivered insofar as these have been granted on the basis of incorrect information on the fulfillment of the relevant performance criteria or other conditions. Bonuses are broadly defined as 'non-fixed' (variable) remuneration - either in cash or in the form of share-based compensation - that is conditional in whole or in part on the achievement of certain targets or the occurrence of certain circumstances. The explanatory notes to the balance sheet shall report on any moderation and/or claim for repayment of Board of Management remuneration. No such reduction of unpaid bonuses or requests for repayment occurred during the financial year 2020.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the company does not grant personal loans to and guarantees on behalf of members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board. No such loans were granted and no such guarantees were issued in 2020, nor were any loans or guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\n\nAlso in compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Articles of Association provide that shares or rights to shares shall not be granted to members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board may only hold shares in the company for the purpose of long-term investment and must refrain from short-term transactions in Philips securities. According to Philips' internal rules of conduct with respect to inside information, members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are only allowed to trade in Philips securities (including the exercise of stock options) during 'windows' of 20 business days following the publication of annual and quarterly results (provided further the person involved has no inside information regarding Philips at that time,",

Furthermore, members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are prohibited from trading, directly or indirectly, in securities of any of the companies belonging to Philips' peer group (as determined by the Supervisory Board), during one week preceding the disclosure of Philips' annual or quarterly results.\n\nTransactions in Philips shares carried out by members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are reported to the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation and, if necessary, to other relevant authorities.\n\n## Indemnification\n\nUnless Dutch law provides otherwise, the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board shall be reimbursed by the company for various costs and expenses, such as the reasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of Association. Under certain circumstances, described in the Articles of Association, such as an act or failure to act by a member of the Board of Management or a member of the Supervisory Board that can be characterized as intentional ( opzettelijk ), intentionally reckless ( bewust roekeloos ) or seriously culpable ( ernstig verwijtbaar ), there will be no entitlement to this reimbursement unless the law or the principles of reasonableness and fairness require otherwise. The company has also taken out liability insurance (D&O Directors & Officers) for the persons concerned.\n\n## Diversity\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the Executive Committee are selected taking into account the company's Diversity Policy, which is published on the company's website.\n\nFor more details on the Diversity Policy and board diversity, please refer to Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, starting on page 92. For more details on the Diversity Policy, the profile of the Supervisory Board and board diversity please refer to Supervisory Board report, starting on page 87 and to Report of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, starting on page 92\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDutch law on conflicts of interest provides that a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board may not participate in the adoption of resolutions if he or she has a direct or indirect personal conflict of interest with the company or related enterprise. If all members of the Board of Management have a conflict of interest, the resolution concerned will be considered by the Supervisory Board. If all members of the Supervisory Board have a conflict of interest, the resolution concerned must be considered by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the company's corporate governance includes rules to specify situations in which a potential or actual conflict may exist, procedures to avoid such conflicts of interest as much as possible, and to deal with such conflicts should they arise. Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interest, if any, must be mentioned in the Annual Report for the financial year in question. No decisions to enter into material transactions in which there are conflicts of interest with members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board were taken during the financial year 2020.\n\n## Outside directorships\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, members of the Board of Management require the approval of the Supervisory Board before they can accept a position as a member of a supervisory board or a position as a nonexecutive director on a one-tier board (Non-Executive Directorship) at another company. The Supervisory Board must be notified of other important positions (to be) held by a member of the Board of Management.\n\nDutch law provides for certain limitations on the number of Non-Executive Directorships a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board may hold. No member of the Board of Management shall hold more than two NonExecutive Directorships at 'large' companies ( naamloze vennootschappen or besloten vennootschappen ) or 'large' foundations ( stichtingen ), as defined under Dutch law, and no member of the Board of Management shall hold the position of chairman of another one-tier board or the position of chairman of another supervisory board. No member of the Supervisory Board shall hold more than five Non-Executive Directorships at such companies or foundations, with a position as chairman counting for two. During the financial year 2020 all members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board complied with the limitations described above in this paragraph.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders 9.5\n\n## Meetings\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of Shareholders shall be held no later than six months after the end of the financial year. The agenda for the meeting typically includes: an advisory vote on the remuneration report; discussion of the Annual Report, the adoption of the financial statements; policy on additions to reserves and dividends; any proposed dividends or other distributions; discharge of the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board; any other matters proposed by the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management or shareholders in accordance with Dutch law and the Articles of Association.",

Shareholders may attend a meeting in person, vote by proxy (via an independent third party) or grant a power of attorney to a third party to attend the meeting and vote on their behalf. Details on registration for meetings, attendance and proxy voting will be included in the notice convening the relevant meeting.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the record date for the exercise of voting rights and rights relating to shareholders' meetings is set at the 28th day prior to the day of the relevant meeting. Shareholders registered on such date are entitled to attend the meeting and to exercise the other shareholder rights (at the relevant meeting) notwithstanding any subsequent sale of their shares after the record date.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association and Dutch law, requests from shareholders for items to be included on the agenda will generally be honored, subject to the company's rights to refuse to include the requested agenda item under Dutch law, provided that such requests are made in writing at least 60 days before a General Meeting of Shareholders to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board by shareholders representing at least 1% of the company's outstanding capital or, according to the official price list of Euronext Amsterdam, representing a value of at least EUR 50 million.

The company has the obligation to publish such disclosures on its website.\n\n## Main powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe main powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders are:\n\n- \u00b7 to appoint, suspend and dismiss members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 to adopt remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, determine the remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board and to approve long-term incentive (equity-based) plans for the Board of Management;\n- \u00b7 to adopt the annual accounts, to declare dividends and to discharge the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board from any liability in respect of the performance of their respective duties for the previous financial year;\n- \u00b7 to appoint the company's external auditor;\n- \u00b7 to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association and proposals to dissolve or liquidate the company;\n- \u00b7 to issue shares or rights to shares;\n- \u00b7 to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights of shareholders and to repurchase or cancel outstanding shares; and\n- \u00b7 in accordance with Dutch law, to approve decisions of the Board of Management that are so far-reaching that they would greatly change the identity or nature of the company or the business.\n\nThe company applies principle 4.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code within the framework of the Articles of Association and Dutch law and in the manner described in this corporate governance report. All issued and outstanding shares carry voting rights and each share confers the right to cast one vote in a shareholders' meeting. Pursuant to Dutch law, no votes may be cast at a General Meeting of Shareholders in respect of shares which are held by the company. There are no special statutory rights attached to the shares of the company and no restrictions on the voting rights of the company's shares exist. Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law and/or the Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting of Shareholders are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast and do not require a quorum.\n\n## Share capital; issue and repurchase of (rights to) shares\n\nThe authorized share capital of the company amounts to EUR 800 million, divided into 2 billion common shares with a nominal value of 20 eurocents each and 2 billion preference shares also with a nominal value of 20 eurocents each. On December 31, 2020, the issued share capital amounted to EUR 182,210,600.20 divided into 911,053,001 common shares and no preference shares. All shares are fully paid-up. There are currently no limitations, either under Dutch law or the Articles of Association, to the transfer of the common shares.\n\nOnly Euroclear shares are traded on Euronext Amsterdam. Only New York Registry Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Pursuant to Section 10:138(2) of the Dutch Civil Code, the laws of the State of New York are applicable to the proprietary regime with respect to the New York Registry Shares, which proprietary regime includes the requirements for a transfer of, or the creation of an in rem right in, such New York Registry Shares. Euroclear shares and New York Registry Shares may be exchanged for each other.\n\nAs per December 31, 2020, approximately 93% of the common shares were held through the system of Euroclear Nederland (Euroclear shares) and approximately 7% of the common shares were represented by New York Registry Shares issued in the name of approximately 911 holders of record, including Cede & Co.

Since certain shares are held by brokers and other nominees, these numbers may not be representative of the actual number of United States beneficial holders or the number of New York Registry Shares beneficially held by US residents.\n\nAt the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it was resolved to authorize the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares or to grant rights to acquire shares in the company as well as to restrict or exclude the pre-emption right accruing to shareholders up to and including October 29, 2021. This authorization is limited to a maximum of 10% of the number of shares issued as of April 30, 2020.\n\nIn addition, at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it was resolved to authorize the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to acquire shares in the company within the limits of the Articles of Association and within a certain price range up to and including October 29, 2021. The maximum number of shares the company may hold will not exceed 10% of the issued share capital as of April 30, 2020. The number of shares may be increased by 10% of the issued capital as of that same date in connection with the execution of share repurchase programs for capital reduction programs.\n\n## Risk management approach 9.6\n\nRisk management and control forms an integral part of the Philips business planning and performance review cycle. The company's risk management policy and framework are designed to provide reasonable assurance that its strategic and operational objectives are met, that legal requirements are complied with, and that the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures is safeguarded. Please refer to Risk management, starting on page 74 for a more detailed description of Philips' approach to risk management (including Internal Control over Financial Reporting), risk categories and factors, and certain specific risks that have been identified.\n\nWith respect to financial reporting, a structured self-assessment and monitoring process is used company-wide to assess, document, review and monitor compliance with Internal Control over Financial Reporting. On the basis of the outcome of this process, the Board of Management confirms that: (i) the management report (within the meaning of section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code) provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems; (ii) such systems provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies; (iii) based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis; and (iv) the management report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expected continuity of the\n\ncompany for a period of 12 months after the preparation of the report. The financial statements fairly represent the financial condition and result of operations of the company and provide the required disclosures.\n\nIn view of the above, the Board of Management believes that it is in compliance with best practice 1.4.2 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. It should be noted that the above does not imply that the internal risk management and control systems provide certainty as to the realization of operational and financial business objectives, nor can they prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud or non- compliances with rules and regulations. The above statement on internal control should not be construed as a statement in response to the requirements of section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The statement as to compliance with section 404 is set forth in . Management's report on internal control, starting on page 120\n\n## Annual financial statements and external audit 9.7\n\nThe annual financial statements are prepared by the Board of Management and reviewed by the Supervisory Board upon the advice of its Audit Committee, taking into account the report of the external auditor. Upon approval by the Supervisory Board, the accounts are signed by all members of both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and are published together with the opinion of the external auditor. The Board of Management is responsible, under the supervision of the Supervisory Board, for the quality and completeness of such publicly disclosed financial reports. The annual financial statements are presented for discussion and adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to be convened subsequently.\n\nThe external auditor is appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the Articles of Association. Philips' current external auditor, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, was appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 7, 2015, for a term of four years starting January 1, 2016 and was reappointed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 9, 2019 for a term of three years starting January 1, 2020.\n\nDutch law requires the separation of audit and non-audit services, meaning the company's external auditor is not allowed to provide non-audit services. This is reflected in the Auditor Policy, which is published on the company's website. The policy is also in line with (and in some ways stricter than) applicable US rules, under which the appointed external auditor must be independent from the company both in fact and appearance.",

Proposed audit-related services may be pre-approved at the beginning of the year by the Audit Committee (annual pre-approval) or may be pre-approved during the year by the Audit Committee in respect of a particular engagement (specific pre-approval). The annual pre-approval is based on a detailed, itemized list of services to be provided, which is designed to ensure that there is no management discretion in determining whether a service has been approved, and to ensure that the Audit Committee is informed of each of the services it is pre-approving. Unless preapproval with respect to a specific service has been given at the beginning of the year, each proposed service requires specific pre-approval during the year. Any annually pre-approved services where the fee for the engagement is expected to exceed pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require specific pre-approval. The term of any annual pre-approval is 12 months from the date of the pre-approval unless the Audit Committee states otherwise. During 2020, there were no services provided to the Company by the external auditor which were not pre-approved by the Audit Committee.\n\n## Stichting Preferente Aandelen Philips 9.8\n\nStichting Preferente Aandelen Philips, a Foundation ( stichting ) organized under Dutch law, has been granted the right to acquire preference shares in the capital of Royal Philips, as stated in the company's Articles of Association. In addition, the Foundation has the right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an inquiry procedure within the meaning of section 2:344 Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe object of the Foundation is to represent the interests of Royal Philips, the enterprises maintained by the company and its affiliated companies within the company's group, in such a way that the interests of the company, these enterprises and all parties involved with them are safeguarded as effectively as possible, and that they are afforded maximum protection against influences which, in conflict with those interests, may undermine the autonomy and identity of Philips and those enterprises, and also to do anything related to the above ends or conducive to them. This object includes the protection of Philips against (an attempt at) an unsolicited takeover or other attempt to exert (de facto) control of the company. The arrangement will allow Philips to determine its position in relation to the relevant third party (or parties) and its (their) plans, to seek alternatives and to defend the company's interests and those of its stakeholders.\n\nThe mere notification that the Foundation exercises its right to acquire preference shares will result in such shares being effectively issued. The Foundation may exercise this right for as many preference shares as there are common shares in the company outstanding at that time. No preference shares have been issued as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe members of the self-electing Board of the Foundation are Messrs J.M. Hessels, P.N. Wakkie and J.P. de Kreij. No Philips Supervisory Board or Board of Management members or Philips officers are represented on the board of the Foundation.\n\nOther than the arrangements made with the Foundation referred to above, the company does not have any measures which exclusively or almost exclusively have the purpose of defending against unsolicited public offers for shares in the capital of the company. It should be noted that the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board remain under all circumstances authorized to exercise all powers vested in them to promote the interests of Philips.\n\nThe company has issued certain corporate bonds, the provisions of which contain a 'Change of Control Triggering Event' or a 'Change of Control Put Event'. Upon the occurrence of such events, the company might be required to offer to redeem or purchase any outstanding bonds at certain pre-determined prices. Please also refer to Debt, starting on page 174.\n\n## Investor Relations 9.9\n\nPhilips is continuously focused on maintaining strong and open relations with its shareholders. In addition to communication with its shareholders at shareholders' meetings, the company may discuss its financial results during conference calls, which are broadly accessible. The company also publishes annual, semi-annual and quarterly reports and press releases, and informs investors via its website.\n\nFrom time to time the company communicates with investors and analysts via roadshows, broker conferences and a Capital Markets Day, which are announced in advance on the company's website. The purpose of these engagements is to further inform the market of the results, strategy and decisions made, as well as to receive feedback from shareholders. It is the company's policy to post presentations to investors and analysts on its website. Philips applies recommendation 4.2.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which it does not view (in line with market practice) as extending to less important analyst meetings and presentations.",

These communications take place either at the initiative of the company or at the initiative of investors/analysts. The company is generally represented by its Investor Relations department during these interactions, however, on a limited number of occasions the Investor Relations department is accompanied by one or more members of the senior management. The subject matter of the bilateral communications ranges from individual queries from investors/analysts to more elaborate discussions following disclosures that the company has made, such as its annual and quarterly reports. Philips complies with applicable rules and regulations on fair and non-selective disclosure and equal treatment of shareholders.\n\n## Major shareholders 9.10\n\nThe Dutch Act on Financial Supervision imposes an obligation on persons holding certain interests to disclose ( inter alia ) percentage holdings in the capital and/or voting rights in the company when such holdings reach, exceed or fall below 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 95 percent (as a result of an acquisition or disposal by a person, or as a result of a change in the company's total number of voting rights or capital issued). Certain derivatives (settled in kind or in cash) are also taken into account when calculating the capital interest. The statutory obligation to disclose capital interest relates not only to gross long positions, but also to gross short positions. Required disclosures must be made to the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) without delay. The AFM then notifies the company of such disclosures and includes them in a register, which is published on the AFM's website. Furthermore, an obligation to disclose (net) short positions is set out in the EU Regulation on Short Selling.\n\nThe AFM register shows the following notifications of substantial holdings and/or voting rights at or above the 3% threshold: BlackRock, Inc.: substantial holding of 5.03% and 6.19% of the voting rights (January 5, 2017); UBS Group AG: substantial holding of 3.78% and 3.78% of the voting rights (February 1, 2021). The AFM register also shows a notification by Philips of a substantial holding of 3.27% in its own share capital (no voting rights).\n\n## Corporate information 9.11\n\nThe company began as a limited partnership with the name Philips & Co in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 1891, and was converted into the company with limited liability N.V.Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken on September 11, 1912. The company's name was changed to Philips Electronics N.V. on May 6, 1994, to Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. on April 1, 1998, and to Koninklijke Philips N.V. on May 15, 2013.\n\nThe majority of the shares in Royal Philips are held through the system maintained by the Dutch Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Nederland). In the past, Philips has also issued (physical) bearer share certificates (\"Share Certificates\"). A limited number of Share Certificates have not been surrendered yet, although the holders of Share Certificates are still entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Royal Philips. It is noted that, as a result of Dutch legislation that became effective per July 2019, the relevant shares were registered in the name of Royal Philips by operation of law per January 1, 2021. Owners of Share Certificates will continue to be entitled to a corresponding number of shares, but may not exercise the rights attached to such shares until they surrender their Share Certificates. Owners of Share Certificates may come forward to do so and to receive a corresponding number of shares until January 1, 2026 at the latest. As per January 2, 2026, entitlements attached to the Share Certificates not surrendered, will expire by operation of law. For more information, please contact the Investor Relations department by email (investor.relations@philips.com) or telephone (+31-20-59 77222).\n\nThe statutory seat of the company is Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and the statutory list of all subsidiaries and affiliated companies, prepared in accordance with the relevant legal requirements (Dutch Civil Code, Book 2, Sections 379 and 414), forms part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is deposited at the office of the Commercial Register in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (file no. 17001910).

(Royal Philips) is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a15 (f) under the US Securities Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions \u037e providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements \u037e providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization \u037e and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Board of Management conducted an assessment of Royal Philips' internal control over financial reporting based on the 'Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)' established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nBased on the Board of Management's assessment of the effectiveness of Royal Philips' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, it has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, Royal Philips' internal control over Group financial reporting is considered effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Royal Philips' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as included in this section Group financial statements, has been audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which follows hereafter.\n\nBoard of Management Frans van Houten Abhijit Bhattacharya Marnix van Ginneken\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting 10.1.1\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Report of the independent auditor 10.2\n\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting is set out in Management's report on internal control, starting on page 120.

In our opinion, Koninklijke Philips N.V. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying section 'Management's report on internal control', of this Annual Report. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nErnst & Young Accountants LLP\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands February 23, 2021",

These accounting policies have been applied by group entities.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the presentation currency. Due to rounding, amounts may not add up precisely to the totals provided.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates inherently contain a degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nIn the process of applying the accounting policies, management has made estimates and assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, as well as to the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The company evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases the estimates on historical experience, current and expected future outcomes, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that Philips believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to circumstances beyond the company's control and are reflected in the assumptions if and when they occur. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets\n\nand liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. The company revises material estimates if changes occur in the circumstances or if there is new information or experience on which an estimate was or can be based. Reference is made to the note on COVID-19, starting on page 142 which includes further details on the impact of the pandemic on these significant judgments and estimates.\n\nThe areas where the most significant judgments and estimates are made are goodwill, deferred tax asset recoverability, valuation of inventories, impairments, classification and measurement of financial instruments, the accounting for an arrangement containing a lease, the assessment whether a lease option to extend or cancel a lease in which the company is a lessee is reasonably certain to be exercised or not, revenue recognition, tax risks and other contingencies, assessment of control, classification of assets and liabilities held for sale and the presentation of items of profit and loss and cash flows as continuing or discontinued, as well as when determining the fair values of acquired identifiable intangible assets, contingent considerations and investments based on an assessment of future cash flows (e.g. earn out arrangements as part of acquisitions). For further discussion of these significant judgements and estimates, reference is made to the respective accounting policies and notes within these Consolidated financial statements that relate to the above topics.\n\nFurther judgment is applied when analyzing impairments of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use that are performed annually and whenever a triggering event has occurred to determine whether the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. These analyses are generally based on estimates of discounted future cash flows. Furthermore, the company applies judgment when actuarial assumptions are established to anticipate future events that are used in calculating post-employment benefit expenses and liabilities. These factors include assumptions with respect to interest rates, rates of increase in healthcare costs, rates of future compensation increases, turnover rates and life expectancy.\n\n## Changes in presentation from the prior year\n\nAccounting policies have been applied consistently for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, except for the item mentioned below. In addition, certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\n## Change in per share calculations\n\nOn June 26, 2020, the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders approved a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, in shares only. The dividend was settled in July through the issuance of 18,080,198 new common shares. In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, per share calculations have been adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented to reflect the issuance of shares for the",

Further reference is made to Earnings per share, starting on page 158.\n\n## Specific choices within IFRS\n\nIn certain instances, IFRS allows alternative accounting treatments for measurement and/or disclosure. Philips has adopted one of the treatments as appropriate to the circumstances of the company. The most important of these alternative treatments are mentioned below.\n\n## Tangible and intangible fixed assets\n\nUnder IFRS, an entity shall choose either the cost model or the revaluation model as its accounting model for tangible and intangible fixed assets. In this respect, items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives and residual values are evaluated annually. Furthermore, the company chose to apply the cost model, meaning that costs relating to product development, the development and purchase of software for internal use and other intangible assets are capitalized and subsequently amortized over the estimated useful life. Further information on Tangible and Intangible fixed assets can be found in Property, plant and equipment, starting on page 160 and in Intangible assets excluding goodwill, starting on page 166, respectively.\n\n## Employee benefit accounting\n\nIFRS does not specify how an entity should present its service costs related to pensions and net interest on the net defined-benefit liability (asset) in the Consolidated statements of income. With regards to these elements, the company presents service costs in Income from operations and the net interest expenses related to defined-benefit plans in Financial expense.\n\nFurther information on employee benefit accounting can be found in Postemployment benefits, starting on page 179.\n\n## Cash flow statements\n\nUnder IFRS, an entity shall report cash flows from operating activities using either the direct method (whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments are disclosed) or the indirect method (whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows). In this respect, the company chose to prepare the cash flow statements using the indirect method.\n\nFurthermore, interest cash flows are presented in cash flows from operating activities rather than in cash flows from financing or investing activities, because they enter into the determination of profit or loss. The company chose to present dividends paid to shareholders of Koninklijke Philips N.V. as a component of cash\n\nflows from financing activities, rather than to present such dividends as cash flows from operating activities, which is an allowed alternative under IFRS.\n\nConsolidated statements of cash flows can be found in Consolidated statements of cash flows, starting on page 125.\n\n## Policies that are more critical in nature\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods in the normal course of business is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied and it is based on the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer. The consideration expected by the company may include fixed and/or variable amounts which can be impacted by sales returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. The company adjusts the consideration for the time value of money for the contracts where no explicit interest rate is mentioned if the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds six months. Revenue for the sale of goods is recognized when control of the asset is transferred to the buyer and only when it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when uncertainties related to a variable consideration are resolved.\n\nTransfer of control varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale. For consumer-type products in the segment Personal Health businesses, control is transferred when the product is shipped and delivered to the customer and title and risk have passed to the customer (depending on the delivery conditions) and acceptance of the product has been obtained. Examples of delivery conditions are 'Free on Board point of delivery' and 'Costs, Insurance Paid point of delivery', where the point of delivery may be the shipping warehouse or any other point of destination as agreed in the contract with the customer and where control is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenues from transactions relating to distinct goods or services are accounted for separately based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling price is defined as the price that would be charged for the goods or service in a separate transaction under similar conditions to similar customers, which within the company is mainly the Country Target Price (CTP). The transaction price determined (taking into account variable considerations) is allocated to performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling prices. These transactions mainly occur in the segments Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Connected Care businesses and include arrangements that require subsequent installation and training activities in order to make distinct goods operable for the customer. As such, the related installation and training activities are part of",

Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the installation has been completed and the equipment is ready to be used by the customer in the way contractually agreed.\n\nRevenues are recorded net of sales taxes. A variable consideration is recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Such assessment is performed on each reporting date to check whether it is constrained. For products for which a right of return exists during a defined period, revenue recognition is determined based on the historical pattern of actual returns, or in cases where such information is not available revenue recognition is postponed until the return period has lapsed. Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets.\n\nA provision is recognized for assurance-type product warranty at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-ofcharge services that will be incurred by the company with respect to the products sold. For certain products, the customer has the option to purchase the warranty separately, which is considered a separate performance obligation on top of the assurance-type product warranty. For such warranties which provide distinct service, revenue recognition occurs on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty contract period.\n\nIn the case of loss under a sales agreement, the loss is recognized immediately.\n\nExpenses incurred for shipping and handling of internal movements of goods are recorded as cost of sales. Shipping and handling related to sales to third parties are recorded as selling expenses. When shipping and handling are part of a project and billed to the customer, then the related expenses are recorded as cost of sales. Shipping and handling billed to customers are distinct and separate performance obligations and recognized as revenues. Expenses incurred for sales commissions that are considered incremental to the contracts are recognized immediately in the Consolidated statements of income as selling expenses as a practical expedient under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nRevenue from services is recognized over a period of time as the company transfers control of the services to the customer which is demonstrated by the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits provided by the company. The amount of revenues is measured by reference to the progress made towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, which in general is evenly over time. Service revenue related to repair and maintenance activities for goods sold is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are rendered.\n\nRoyalty income from brand license arrangements is recognized based on a right to access the license, which in practice means over the contract period based on a fixed amount or reliable estimate of sales made by a licensee.\n\nRoyalty income from intellectual property rights such as technology licenses or patents is recognized based on a right-to-use the license, which in practice means at a point in time based on the contractual terms and substance of the relevant agreement with a licensee. However, revenue related to intellectual property contracts with variable consideration where a constraint in the estimation is identified, is recognized over the contract period and is based on actual or reliably estimated sales made by a licensee.\n\nThe company receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule or credit period, as established in our contracts. Credit periods are determined based on standard terms, which vary according to local market conditions. Amounts posted in deferred revenue for which the goods or services have not yet been transferred to the customer and amounts that have either been received or are due, are presented as Contract liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes comprise current, non-current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected taxes payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nIn cases where it is concluded it is not probable that tax authorities will accept a tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty is reflected in the recognition and measurement of tax assets and liabilities or, alternatively, a provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled, where this can be reasonably estimated. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax assets and liabilities. Such changes to tax assets and liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period during which such a determination is made.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the consolidated balance sheets method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in",

Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities, but the company intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits against which they can be utilized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated companies to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable or deductible. Changes in tax rates and tax laws are reflected in the period when the change was enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nAny subsequent adjustment to a tax asset or liability that originated in discontinued operations and for which no specific arrangements were made at the time of divestment, due to a change in the tax base or its measurement, is allocated to discontinued operations (i.e. backwards tracing). Examples are a tax rate change or change in retained assets or liabilities directly relating to the discontinued operation. Any subsequent change to the recognition of deferred tax assets is allocated to the component in which the taxable gain is or will be recognized. The above principles are applied to the extent the 'discontinued operations' are sufficiently separable from continuing operations.\n\nFurther information on income tax can be found in Income taxes, starting on page 155.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event, the company has a present legal or constructive obligation, the amount can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the\n\nobligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. The accounting and presentation for some of the company's provisions is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Product warranty - A provision for assurance-type product warranty is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighing of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.\n- \u00b7 Environmental provisions - Measurement of liabilities associated with environmental obligations is based on current legal and constructive requirements. Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The carrying amount of environmental liabilities is regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts and changes in law.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring-related provisions - The provision for restructuring mainly relates to the estimated costs of initiated restructurings, the most significant of which have been approved by the Executive Committee, and which generally involve the realignment of certain parts of the industrial and commercial organization. When such restructurings require discontinuance and/or closure of lines of activities, the anticipated costs of closure or discontinuance are included in restructuring provisions. A liability is recognized for those costs only when the company has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation with those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Before a provision is established, the company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with the restructuring.\n- \u00b7 Legal provisions - In relation to legal claim provisions and settlements, the relevant balances are transferred to Other liabilities at the point when the amount and timing of cash outflows are no longer uncertain. Settlements which are agreed for amounts in excess of existing provisions are reflected as increases in Other liabilities.\n\nFurther information on provisions can be found in Provisions, starting on page 176.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is described in the Basis of consolidation note. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Further information on goodwill can also be found in Goodwill, starting on page 162.\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The useful lives are evaluated annually. Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with the exception of intangible",

Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, the company has sufficient resources and the intention to complete development and can measure the attributable expenditure reliably.\n\nThe capitalized development expenditure comprises of all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Other development expenditures and expenditures on research activities are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. Capitalized development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization of capitalized development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.\n\nFurther information on intangible assets other than goodwill can be found in Intangible assets excluding goodwill, starting on page 166.\n\n## Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the Consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or is a part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to sell.\n\nIf a discontinued operation is sold in stages as part of a single coordinated plan until it is completely sold, then the Investment in associate that is recognized upon sale of a portion that results in Philips having significant influence in the operation (rather than control) is continued to be treated as discontinued operation provided that the held for sale criteria are met.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal. Any gain or loss from disposal, together with the results of these operations until the date of disposal, is reported separately as discontinued operations. The financial information of discontinued operations is excluded from the respective captions in the Consolidated financial statements and related notes for all periods presented. Comparatives in the Consolidated balance sheets are not represented when a non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale. Comparatives are represented for presentation of discontinued operations in the Consolidated statements of cash flows and Consolidated statements of income.\n\nAdjustments in the current period to amounts previously presented in discontinued operations that are directly related to the disposal of a discontinued operation in a prior period, and for which no specific arrangements were made at the time of divestment, are classified separately in discontinued operations. Circumstances to which these adjustments may relate include resolution of uncertainties that arise from the terms of the disposal transaction, such as the resolution of purchase price adjustments and indemnifications, resolution of uncertainties that arise from and are directly related to the operations of the component before its disposal, such as environmental and assurance-type product warranty obligations retained by the company, and the settlement of employee benefit plan obligations provided that the settlement is directly related to the disposal transaction.\n\nFurther information on discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale can be found in Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 147.\n\n## Impairment\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require. In case of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use, either internal or external sources of information are considered indicators that an asset or a CGU may be impaired. In most cases the company identified its cash-generating units for goodwill at one level below that of an operating segment. Cash flows at this level are substantially independent from other cash flows and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Executive Committee. An impairment loss is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, whichever is the greater, its value in use or its fair value less cost of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is",

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with the greater of its value in use and fair value less cost of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is measured as the amount obtained from a sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction, less costs of disposal. If the carrying amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent that there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of impairment are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables, contract assets, lease receivables, debt investments carried at fair value through Other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and amortized cost. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.\n\nECLs are recognized in two stages. For credit risk exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECLs). The company considers a financial asset to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the\n\ncompany in full or when the financial asset is past due. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (lifetime ECLs). When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the company's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information, such as forecast economic conditions that affect the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.\n\nFor all trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the company applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring ECLs, which uses the lifetime ECL allowance. To measure the ECLs on trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the company takes into account credit-risk concentration, collective debt risk based on average historical losses, specific circumstances such as serious adverse economic conditions in a specific country or region, and other forward-looking information. Trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of the asset, for example because of bankruptcy or other forms of receivership.\n\nFurther information on financial assets can be found in Other financial assets, starting on page 168.\n\n## Other policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Koninklijke Philips N.V. and all subsidiaries that the company controls, i.e. when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and in cases where Philips has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, Philips considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including the contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee, rights arising from other contractual arrangements and the company's voting rights and potential voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.",

Any surplus or deficit arising from the loss of control is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. If the company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, such interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as either an equityaccounted investee (associate) or as a financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained. Further information on loss of control can be found in Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 147.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the company.\n\nThe company measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n- \u00b7 the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; plus\n- \u00b7 if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less\n- \u00b7 the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the company incurs are expensed as incurred.\n\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and initially is presented in Long-term provisions. When the timing and amount of the consideration become more certain, it is reclassified to Accrued liabilities. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nNon-controlling interests are measured on the basis of their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.\n\nFurther information on business combinations can be found in Acquisitions and divestments, starting on page 148.\n\nAcquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognized. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.\n\n## Investments in associates (equity-accounted investees)\n\nAssociates are all entities over which the company has significant influence, but no control. Significant influence is presumed with a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or when the company has board representation through which it is able to exercise significant influence. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of an investment includes the carrying amount of goodwill identified on acquisition. An impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the investment as a whole.\n\nThe company's share of the net income of these companies is included in Investments in associates, net of income taxes, in the Consolidated statements of income, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the company, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. Dilution gains and losses arising from investments in associates are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income as part of Investments in associates, net of income taxes. When the company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term loans) is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Unrealized gains on transactions between the company and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the company's interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Remeasurement differences of an equity stake resulting from gaining control over an investee that was previously recorded as an associate are recorded under Investments in associates.\n\nFurther information on investments in associates can be found in Interests in entities, starting on page 149.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nThe financial statements of all group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency).

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income, except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nForeign currency differences arising from translations are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income, except for equity investments measured at fair value through OCI which are recognized in Other comprehensive income. If there is an impairment which results in foreign currency differences being recognized, these differences are reclassified from Other comprehensive income to the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nAll foreign exchange differences are presented as part of Cost of sales, with the exception of tax items and financial income and expense, which are recognized in the same line item as they relate to in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign currency differences arising upon translation of foreign operations into euros are recognized in Other comprehensive income, and presented as part of Currency translation differences in Equity. However, if the operation is a nonwholly-owned subsidiary, the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to Non-controlling interests.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the Currency translation differences related to the foreign operation is reclassified to the Consolidated statements of income as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the company disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the respective proportion of the cumulative amount is\n\nreattributed to Non-controlling interests. When the company disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets\n\n## Recognition and initial measurement\n\nNon-derivative financial assets are recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Purchases and sales of financial assets in the normal course of business are accounted for at the trade date. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. Gains or losses, if any, are recorded in Financial income and expense. Non-derivative financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\nThe company classifies its non-derivative financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those that are measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI (FVTOCI) or profit or loss (FVTPL);\n- \u00b7 those that are measured at amortized cost.\n\nIn assessing the classification, the company considers the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded in either the Consolidated statements of income or in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at FVTOCI. For investments in these equity instruments, the company does not subsequently reclassify between FVTOCI and FVTPL. For debt investments, assets are reclassified between FVTOCI, FVTPL and amortized cost only when its business model for managing those assets changes.",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\nNon-derivative financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances, certain money market funds and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Further information on cash and cash equivalents can be found in Cash flow statement supplementary information, starting on page 183.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivable balances that are held to collect are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are subject to impairment as explained in the impairment section of this note. Receivables that are held to collect and sell are subsequently measured at FVTOCI and are also subject to impairment. The company derecognizes receivables on entering into factoring transactions if the company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards or if the company does not retain control over those receivables. Further information on receivables can be found in Receivables, starting on page 169.\n\n## Other (non-)current financial assets\n\nOther (non-)current financial assets include both debt instruments and equity instruments.\n\nDebt instruments include those subsequently carried at amortized cost, those carried at FVTPL and those carried at FVTOCI. Classification depends on the company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortized cost and are subject to impairment. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Financial income using the effective interest rate method. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVTOCI and are subject to impairment. Movements in the carrying amounts are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses, which are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from equity to the Consolidated\n\nstatements of income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Financial income using the effective interest rate method.\n\nDebt instruments that do not meet the criteria for amortized cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income in the period in which it arises.\n\nEquity investments are subsequently measured at fair value. Equity instruments that are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. For equity instruments that are not held for trading, the company makes an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition whether to account for the equity investment at FVTPL or FVTOCI. Where management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Consolidated statements of income following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognized in the Consolidated statements of income when the company's right to receive payments is established.\n\nFurther information on other (non-)current financial assets can be found in Other financial assets, starting on page 168\n\n## Debt and other financial liabilities\n\nDebt and other financial liabilities, excluding derivative financial liabilities and provisions, are initially measured at fair value and, in the case of debt and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Debt and other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.\n\nDebt and other financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or has expired.\n\nFurther information on debt and other financial liabilities can be found in Debt, starting on page 174.\n\n## Equity\n\nCommon shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Where the company purchases the company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental transaction costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly",

The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\nFurther information on equity can be found in Equity, starting on page 170.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting\n\nThe company uses derivative financial instruments principally to manage its foreign currency risks and, to a more limited extent, interest rate and commodity price risks. All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at the trade date and classified as current or non-current assets or liabilities based on the maturity date or the early termination date. The company measures all derivative financial instruments at fair value that is derived from the market prices of the instruments, calculated on the basis of the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates, or derived from option pricing models, as appropriate. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income, except for derivatives that are highly effective and qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting.\n\nChanges in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts attributable to forward points and changes in the time value of the option contracts are deferred in the cash flow hedges reserve within equity. The deferred amounts are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income against the related hedged transaction when it occurs.\n\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in OCI until the Consolidated statements of income are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe company formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it is established that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is expected that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated balance sheets at its fair value, and gains\n\nand losses that were accumulated in OCI are recognized immediately in the same line item as they relate to in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nForeign currency differences arising upon retranslation of financial instruments designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized directly in the currency translation differences reserve through OCI, to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Offsetting and master netting agreements\n\nThe company presents financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis as separate line items in the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nMaster netting agreements may be entered into when the company undertakes a number of financial instrument transactions with a single counterparty. Such an agreement provides for a net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default or certain termination events associated with any of the transactions. A master netting agreement may create a right to offset that becomes enforceable and affects the realization or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified termination event. However, if this contractual right is subject to certain limitations then it does not necessarily provide a basis for offsetting, unless both of the offsetting criteria are met, i.e. there is a legally enforceable right and an intention to settle net or simultaneously.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe costs of property, plant and equipment comprise all directly attributable costs (including the cost of material and direct labor).\n\nDepreciation is generally calculated using the straight-line method over the useful life of the asset. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Other business income. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless leading to an extension of the original lifetime or capacity.\n\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nFurther information on property, plant and equipment can be found in Property, plant and equipment, starting on page 160.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe company determines whether an arrangement constitutes or contains a lease at inception, which is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement constitutes or contains a lease if fulfillment is",

The right-ofuse asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date is used, which is based on an assessment of interest rates the company would have to pay to borrow funds, including the consideration of factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the Consolidated statements of income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs;\n- \u00b7 restoration costs.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently accounted for using principles for property, plant and equipment. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Consolidated statements of income. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small items of office furniture considered to be of low value (i.e. less than EUR 5,000).\n\nThe company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal.\n\nThe company leases various items of real estate, vehicles and other equipment. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may have extension or termination options.\n\nThe related year end disclosures pertaining to leases as lessee have been disclosed in respective notes according to the nature of the reported item. Below are the references with respect to IFRS 16 year-end disclosures as lessee:\n\n- \u00b7 For disclosure on Right-of-use assets and related movement, refer to Property, plant and equipment, starting on page 160;\n- \u00b7 Short-term and low-value leases, are disclosed in Income from operations, starting on page 150;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures regarding interest expenses on lease liabilities, are disclosed in Financial income and expenses, starting on page 154;\n- \u00b7 For disclosure on leasing related cash outflow and the split between interest and principal payments, refer to the Consolidated statements of cash flows, starting on page 125 and Cash flow statement supplementary information, starting on page 183;\n- \u00b7 For disclosure on sale and leaseback transactions, refer to Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 196;\n- \u00b7 For disclosure on lease liabilities and maturity analysis, refer to Debt, starting on page 174;\n- \u00b7 Other qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the nature of lessee's leasing activities and future lease obligations, refer to Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 196;",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## Company as a lessor\n\nWhen the company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases in which the company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. The company recognizes lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease terms in the Statement of income.\n\nThe related year end disclosures pertaining to leases as lessor have been disclosed in respective notes according to the nature of the reported item. Below are the references with respect to IFRS 16 year-end disclosures as lessor:\n\n- \u00b7 For disclosures on lease income and sublease income, refer to Income from operations, starting on page 150;\n- \u00b7 Other qualitative disclosures regarding the nature of lessor's leasing activities and risk management, refer to Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 196.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, taking into account the stage of completion and the normal capacity of production facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory is reduced for the estimated losses due to obsolescence. This reduction is determined for groups of products based on sales in the recent past and/or expected future demand.\n\nFurther information on inventories can be found in Inventories, starting on page 169.\n\n## Employee benefit accounting\n\nA defined-contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined-contribution pension plans are recognized as an employee benefit expense in the Consolidated statements of income in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n\nA defined-benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a definedcontribution plan. Plans for which the company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts, but to which it does pay non-fixed contributions, are also treated as a defined-benefit plan. The net pension asset or liability recognized in the Consolidated balance sheets in respect of defined-\n\nbenefit post-employment plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the projected defined-benefit obligation at the Consolidated balance sheets date. The defined-benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Recognized assets are limited to the present value of any reductions in future contributions or any future refunds. The net pension liability is presented as a long-term provision; no distinction is made for the short-term portion.\n\nFor the company's major plans, a full discount rate curve of high-quality corporate bonds is used to determine the defined-benefit obligation. The curves are based on Willis Towers Watson's rate methodology which uses data of corporate bonds rated AA or equivalent. For the other plans a single-point discount rate is used based on corporate bonds for which there is a deep market and on the plan's maturity. Plans in countries without a deep corporate bond market use a discount rate based on the local sovereign curve and the plan's maturity.\n\nPension costs in respect of defined-benefit post-employment plans primarily represent the increase of the actuarial present value of the obligation for postemployment benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on the net recognized asset or liability in respect of employee service in previous years.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined-benefit asset or liability comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding interest). The company recognizes all remeasurements in Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe company recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined-benefit obligation being settled, as determined on the date of settlement, and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the company in connection with the settlement. Past service costs arising from the introduction of a change to the benefit payable under a plan or a significant reduction of the number of employees covered by a plan (curtailment) are recognized in full in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nFurther information on post-employment benefit accounting can be found in Post-employment benefits, starting on page 179.\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. The company recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the company's shareholders after certain adjustments.",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\nThe company's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income in the period in which they arise.\n\nFurther information on other employee benefits can be found in Provisions, starting on page 176 in the Other provisions section.\n\n## Share-based payment\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in Share-based compensation, starting on page 186.\n\nThe grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as personnel expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the award. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of income for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized at the beginning and end of that period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant-date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant-date fair value. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met.\n\nWhen an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and shares is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (further details are given in Earnings per share, starting on page 158).\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nFinancial income comprises interest income on funds invested (including financial assets), dividend income, net gains on the disposal of financial assets, net fair value gains on financial assets at FVTPL, net gains on the remeasurement to fair\n\nvalue of any pre-existing interest in an acquiree, and net gains on foreign exchange impacts that are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nInterest income is recognized on an accrual basis in the Consolidated statements of income, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized in the Consolidated statements of income on the date that the company's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.\n\nFinancial expenses comprise interest expenses on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and contingent consideration, losses on disposal of financial assets, net fair value losses on financial assets at FVTPL, impairment losses recognized on financial assets (other than trade receivables), net interest expenses related to defined-benefit plans, interest on lease liabilities and net losses on foreign exchange impacts that are recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nFurther information on financial income and expenses can be found in Financial income and expenses, starting on page 154.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the company will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the Consolidated statements of income as a reduction of the related costs over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate. Grants related to assets are deducted from the cost of the asset and presented net in the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe company recognizes a liability at the fair value of the obligation at the inception of a financial guarantee contract. The guarantee is subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of the obligation or the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Cash flow statements\n\nCash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are translated into the company's functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the cash flow. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified as investing cash flows.",

The Executive Committee decides how to allocate resources and assesses performance. Reportable segments comprise the operating segments Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, Connected Care businesses and Personal Health businesses. Additionally, besides these reportable segments, segment Other exists. Segment accounting policies are the same as the accounting policies applied by the company.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nThe company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its common shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares, which comprises forward purchase contracts, restricted shares, performance shares and share options granted to employees.\n\nFurther information on earnings per share can be found in Earnings per share, starting on page 158.\n\n## New standards and interpretations\n\n## IFRS accounting standards adopted as from 2020\n\nThe company applies, for the first time, certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that, together, significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it clarifies that a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. This amendment had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company, but may impact business combinations entered into by the company in future periods.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are\n\ndirectly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument. These amendments have no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company as it does not have interest rate hedge relationships that are impacted by this.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material\n\nThe amendments provide a new definition of material that states, 'information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.' The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of, nor is there expected to be any future impact to the company.\n\n## Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued on 29 March 2018\n\nThe Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and none of the concepts contained therein override the concepts or requirements in any standard. The purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the IASB in developing standards, to help preparers develop consistent accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place and to assist all parties to understand and interpret the standards. This will affect those entities which developed their accounting policies based on the Conceptual Framework. The revised Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts, updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts. This revision had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS 16 Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. This amendment had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company.",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## IFRS accounting standards to be adopted from 2021 onwards\n\nA number of amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the company beginning on or after January 1, 2021, or later periods, and the company has not early-adopted them. The changes to those standards are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial statements.\n\n## COVID-19 2\n\nIn 2020 COVID-19 affected the global economy and the company's results, balance sheet and cash flows presented in these Consolidated financial statements. A discussion on the impact of the pandemic on the company's financial performance and risks is included in Financial performance, starting on page 26 and Risk management, starting on page 74. The impact of the pandemic on significant accounting matters is disclosed below. Other areas have also been affected, but did not have a significant impact and are therefore not separately disclosed.\n\n## Estimates and uncertainties\n\nAs a result of the uncertainties associated with the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in line with existing accounting policies, the company regularly updates its significant assumptions and estimates to support the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In relation to areas of judgment and estimates as disclosed in our Significant accounting policies, starting on page 128, those which are primarily impacted by COVID-19 include impairment testing, valuation of inventories, measurement of financial instruments and the determination of fair values (for example fair values of acquired identifiable intangible assets, contingent considerations and certain investments). These significant judgments and estimates are further discussed below.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nImpairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets not ready for use\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require such testing. For the Image-Guided Therapy cash-generating unit (CGU), the Sleep & Respiratory Care (S&RC) CGU, and a number of other smaller CGUs, such indicators were identified during the year because of deterioration in the economic environment or market in which these CGUs operate. The impairment tests performed for these CGUs did not result in any impairments.\n\nIn addition, for all goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use an annual impairment test was performed during Q4 2020.\n\nIn determining the recoverable amounts, consideration was given to the uncertainties embedded in the discounted cash flow projections and the appropriateness of key assumptions used in light of the pandemic, which included increased uncertainties around forecasted revenues, higher volatility in applied discount rates and other factors. Further details on these impairment procedures and the results thereof are disclosed in Goodwill, starting on page 162 and Intangible assets excluding goodwill, starting on page 166.\n\nImpairment testing of non-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred tax assets\n\nSimilar to the above, for certain non-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred tax assets, the changes in the economic environment provided an indicator that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Uncertainties in the market and volatility in the financial markets resulted in increased levels of judgment in both the value-in-use calculations as well as in determining the fair value less costs of disposal of such an asset. These uncertainties were reflected in updated assessments on the future use of such assets (including useful life assessments) and in updated input parameters used in underlying calculations, which included using revised expected future cash flows due to the pandemic. Further details on the results of these impairment procedures are disclosed in Intangible assets excluding goodwill, starting on page 166.\n\n## Impairment testing of financial assets\n\nThe company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables, contract assets, lease receivables and debt investments carried at fair value through Other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and amortized cost. In line with the accounting policy disclosed in the Significant accounting policies, starting on page 128, for all financial assets to which the company applies the simplified approach, an updated assessment was made on the lifetime ECL allowance, taking into the account uncertainties resulting from the pandemic. In addition, for those assets to which the company does not apply the simplified approach to measuring ECLs, an assessment was made whether a significant increase in credit risk was observed as a result of COVID-19. In those instances, the allowance was updated to also reflect lifetime ECLs.\n\nIn making these assessments, all reasonable and supportable information was considered. Examples of indicators identified included counterparties breaching their agreed payment terms and counterparties requesting extended payment terms or (partial) waivers. In addition, forward looking elements were taken into consideration such as a deterioration of the credit rating of a counterparty or changes in risks associated with specific countries or regions due to COVID-19. Albeit the methodology applied is consistent with prior periods, certain of these",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\nfactors triggered by the pandemic required an updated assessment of the ECLs. Relevant financial assets were individually assessed and additional ECL allowances were accounted for in those cases where deemed necessary. The overall impact of the increase in the level of ECLs did not have a material impact on the company's financial assets. The company further concluded that none of the agreed changes with counterparties resulted in a substantial modification of such instruments under IFRS 9 Financial instruments.\n\n## Fair values\n\nCertain of the company's financial instruments and other assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. The fair values included in these Consolidated financial statements reflect market participant views and market data at the measurement date under current market conditions. This implies that due to the increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets due to the pandemic, these fair values are subject to significant estimates, in particular for assets and liabilities for which the fair value is based on unobservable inputs (sometimes referred to as Level 3 measurements). Expectations around future cash flows, discount rates and other significant valuation inputs related to the asset or liability as at December 31, 2020 have become subject to a greater level of uncertainty. The fair values determined taking into account these revised input parameters have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. There was no significant impact as a result of the pandemic on any individual assets or liabilities carried at fair value. Further reference is made to Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 193.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nIn addition to what has been described above in terms of impairment testing of non-financial assets, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a significant increase in demand for our products mainly in the Connected Care businesses. As a result, the company made investments during the financial year in order to meet this demand. These investments include, amongst others, additions to existing production lines, establishing new production lines and investing in companyspecific tooling used in the supply chain. Assessing the useful life of these new investments involves a significant amount of judgment, due to the volatility in the demand forecast that affects the expected period over which these assets will be used. In certain cases, this assessment has resulted in new machinery and installations being depreciated over a useful life that is less than three years, whereas the normal useful life of these assets would be between 5 and 10 years. In addition, the general market volatility increased the level of judgment involved in determining the residual values of certain of these assets. Neither of these developments did result in significant changes to our Property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Employee benefit accounting\n\nCOVID-19 also had an impact on the company's long-term employee benefits, including defined-benefit plans. Volatility in the financial markets following the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in increased judgment being required in setting key parameters used in determining these benefits, including discount rates, mortality rates, retention rates and other assumptions supporting the actuarial calculations. In those situations, we established the most appropriate parameters with the help of actuaries and taking into consideration relevant economic conditions. For our funded defined-benefit plans, increased fluctuations in the fair values of the plan assets during the financial year ended December 31, 2020 also caused further volatility in the net obligation. Neither of these impacts were significant for the balances as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Provisions other than employee benefits\n\nAs described in the Significant accounting policies, starting on page 128, the accounting for provisions requires significant judgment around the amount and timing of the outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation. As a result of the pandemic, volatility increased in our supplier commitments and customer demand for many of our businesses, requiring the company to assess its related contracts for onerous elements. In doing so, the company applied assumptions and estimates in relation to future demand forecasts, expected costs of termination and the likely outcomes of ongoing negotiations with suppliers. This has resulted in the recognition of an onerous contract provision, for which reference is made to the disclosure on Other provisions included in Provisions, starting on page 176. No other provisions were materially impacted by COVID-19.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe company's inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In determining the appropriate level of provision for obsolescence, changes in the aging of inventory items in certain businesses and markets due to COVID-19 were considered throughout the year. In addition, current and potential excess stock levels were analyzed, incorporating the impact COVID-19 had on demand in 2020 as well as revised expectations of future demand for these items. No material change in the provision for obsolescence was identified as a result of these procedures.\n\nDue to the changes in demand and therefore production levels within several of our businesses, the company evaluated its standard cost prices, particularly in relation to the absorption of overhead costs and additional costs. The company assessed, based on currently available information, that the change in demand and production levels is not expected to be a sustained change and therefore the standard cost prices were not updated relating to those elements.",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## Taxes\n\nIn response to COVID-19, many governments have changed tax regulations aimed at deferring tax filings and payments, providing tax relief and offering financial assistance. Apart from applied payment deferrals on social contribution payments, the company has no material payment deferrals. In determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the company took into account the uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in its projections on the results of future operations that will generate taxable income, which did not result in a significant impact.\n\n## Treasury and other financial risks\n\nPhilips is exposed to several types of financial risks. In terms of liquidity risk, the company has taken a number of different measures to manage this risk. In addition to the successful placement of EUR 1,000 million fixed-rate notes in March (of which EUR 500 million Sustainability Innovation notes), the company also completed the remainder of the EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program that was announced on January 29, 2019 through individual forward contracts, with settlement dates extending into the second half of 2021. Furthermore, the 2019 Annual Incentive of the Board of Management and the final dividend declared against the net income of 2019 were settled in shares instead of cash. Overall, the company has a solid liquidity position and the company's liquidity risk management procedures have not changed significantly because of COVID-19. No significant concentration risks have been identified as a result of COVID-19 and the company continues to have access to its existing lines of credit. These lines of credits, along with other financial risks to which Philips is exposed, are disclosed in Details of treasury and other financial risks, starting on page 196. Apart from the above measures, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on other financial risks, including how we manage those.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information by segment and main country 3\n\nInformation on income statements in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                            | sales   | sales including intercompany   | depreciation and amortization 1)   | Adjusted EBITA 2) 3)   |\n|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2020                       |         |                                |                                    |                        |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment 4)   | 8,175   | 8,289                          | (536)                              | 816                    |\n| Connected Care             | 5,564   | 5,640                          | (415)                              | 1,195                  |\n| Personal Health            | 5,407   | 5,424                          | (187)                              | 704                    |\n| Other                      | 389     | 463                            | (382)                              | (145)                  |\n| Inter-segment eliminations |         | (281)                          |                                    |                        |\n| Philips Group              | 19,535  | 19,535                         | (1,520)                            | 2,570                  |\n\n|                            | sales   | sales including intercompany   | depreciation and amortization 1)   | Adjusted EBITA 2) 3)   |\n|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2019                       |         |                                |                                    |                        |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment      | 8,485   | 8,576                          | (564)                              | 1,078                  |\n| Connected Care             | 4,674   | 4,705                          | (327)                              | 618                    |\n| Personal Health            | 5,854   | 5,864                          | (186)                              | 943                    |\n| Other                      | 469     | 542                            | (326)                              | (76)                   |\n| Inter-segment eliminations |         | (204)                          |                                    |                        |\n| Philips Group              | 19,482  | 19,482                         | (1,402)                            | 2,563                  |\n| 2018                       |         |                                |                                    |                        |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment      | 7,726   | 7,806                          | (349)                              | 872                    |\n| Connected Care             | 4,341   | 4,358                          | (326)                              | 662                    |\n| Personal Health            | 5,524   | 5,538                          | (171)                              | 860                    |\n| Other                      | 530     | 612                            | (244)                              | (28)                   |\n| Inter-segment eliminations |         | (193)                          |                                    |                        |\n| Philips Group              | 18,121  | 18,121                         | (1,089)                            | 2,366                  |\n\nAs required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments, Philips operating segments are Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, Connected Care businesses and Personal Health businesses, each being responsible for the management of its business worldwide.\n\nPhilips focuses on improving people's lives through meaningful innovation across the health continuum - from healthy living and prevention to diagnosis, treatment and home care.

The acquisitions involved an aggregated net cash outflow of EUR 259 million and a contingent consideration of EUR 70 million at fair value. The company recognized an aggregated Goodwill of EUR 175 million, Other intangible assets of EUR 184 million and Deferred tax liabilities generated from the Intangible assets of EUR 45 million.\n\nOpening balance positions are provisional and subject to final purchase price adjustments, which will be finalized in 2021. The primary provisional accounts subject to change are mainly related to the valuation of the intangible assets and goodwill, as the valuation studies necessary to determine the fair market value of the intangible assets and goodwill assumed are preliminary.\n\nIntact Vascular, Inc. (Intact Vascular) was the most notable acquisition and is discussed below. The remaining two acquisitions involved an aggregated net cash outflow of EUR 28 million. The two acquisitions resulted in an increase in Goodwill of EUR 20 million. Other intangible assets and the related Deferred tax liabilities increased by EUR 15 million and EUR 2 million respectively.\n\n## Intact Vascular\n\nOn September 4, 2020, Philips acquired all shares of Intact Vascular, headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Intact Vascular is a developer of medical devices for minimally invasive peripheral vascular surgery. Philips acquired Intact Vascular to expand its portfolio of minimally invasive therapy options for Peripheral Artery Disease with the Tack Endovascular System, an implant that restores blood flow in small limb vessels, promotes healing and preserves limbs. The Company has purchased shares for an amount of EUR 241 million cash and a contingent consideration of EUR 70 million.\n\nAs of the acquisition date, Intact Vascular forms part of the Image-guided therapy business portfolio of the Diagnosis & Treatment segment.\n\nIn 2020, acquisition-related costs of EUR 2 million were recognized in General and administrative expenses.\n\nThe preliminary condensed opening balance sheet of Intact Vascular was as follows:\n\n## Intact Vascular\n\n## Opening Balance sheet in millions of EUR\n\n|                                             | at acquisition date   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Assets                                      |                       |\n| Intangible assets excluding goodwill        | 169                   |\n| Deferred tax assets                         | 17                    |\n| Inventories                                 | 2                     |\n| Receivables and other current assets        | 1                     |\n| Cash                                        | 10                    |\n| Total Assets                                | 200                   |\n| Liabilities                                 |                       |\n| Accounts payable and other payables         | (2)                   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                    | (42)                  |\n| Total Liabilities                           | (44)                  |\n| Total identifiable net assets at fair value | 156                   |\n| Goodwill arising on acquisition             | 155                   |\n| Total purchase on acquisition               | 311                   |\n| Of which:                                   |                       |\n| Purchase consideration transferred          | (241)                 |\n| Provision for contingent consideration      | (70)                  |\n\nGoodwill recognized in the amount of EUR 155 million mainly represents revenue synergies expected from the combination of Philips' interventional imaging platform and diagnostic and therapeutic devices with Intact Vascular's unique, specialized implantable device to optimize the treatment of patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). Intact Vascular Goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\nThe provision for contingent consideration represents a Long-term provision of EUR 70 million, due in 2022 and 2023. The contingent consideration is based on a specified percentage of forecast revenue share, for which the maximum amount is unlimited. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is re-measured at each reporting period. Therefore, any changes in the fair value impacts reported earnings in each reporting period, thereby resulting in variability in earnings.

The fair value of Technology is based on an estimate of positive future cash flows associated with incremental profits related to excess earnings, discounted at a rate of 15.0%. The line Other includes the Intact Vascular trademarks; Tack Endovascular System and Tack.\n\nThe opening balance position represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquisition. The final determination of the fair market values will be completed in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the valuation studies necessary to determine the fair market value of the intangible assets and goodwill are preliminary.\n\nIntact Vascular is an early stage revenue acquisition. As of the acquisition date, Intact Vascular contribution to sales and net income was not material. The same applies to the combined entity for the reporting period as though the acquisition date had been as of the beginning of the reporting period.\n\n## Divestments\n\nPhilips did not complete any divestments in 2020.\n\n## Future ownership of Domestic Appliances business\n\nOn January 28, 2020, Philips announced that it will review options for future ownership of its Domestic Appliances business belonging to Personal Health. Philips started the process of creating a separate legal structure for this business within the Philips Group, which is expected to be completed in the course of 2021. Under the IFRS 5 assessment Philips has determined that Domestic Appliances business does not qualify as held for sale as of December 31, 2020. Philips concluded that the business as per December 31, 2020 is not available for immediate sale in its present condition to a third party. The Domestic Appliances business had EUR 2.2 billion sales in 2020.

In 2020, Sales to third parties and Net income for these subsidiaries in aggregate are EUR 468 million (December 31, 2019: EUR 581 million) and EUR 6 million (December 31, 2019: EUR 9 million) respectively.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nPhilips has investments in a number of associates. None of them are regarded as individually material. During 2020, Philips purchased 6 investments in associates, which involved an aggregate amount of EUR 37 million.\n\n## Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities\n\nPhilips founded three Philips Medical Capital (PMC) entities, in the United States, France and Germany, in which Philips holds a minority interest. Philips Medical Capital, LLC in the United States is the most significant entity. PMC entities provide healthcare equipment financing and leasing services to Philips customers for diagnostic imaging equipment, patient monitoring equipment, and clinical IT systems.\n\nThe company concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate the PMC entities. In the United States, PMC operates as a subsidiary of De Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. The same structure and treatment is applied to the PMC entities in the other countries, with other majority shareholders. Operating agreements are in place for all PMC entities, whereby acceptance of sales and financing transactions resides with the respective majority shareholder. After acceptance of a transaction by PMC, Philips transfers control and does not retain any obligations towards PMC or its customers, from the sales contracts.\n\nThe company does not have any material exposures to losses from interests in unconsolidated structured entities other than the invested amounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Income from operations 7\n\nFor information related to Sales on a segment and geographical basis, see Information by segment and main country, starting on page 144.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Sales and costs by nature in millions of EUR\n\n|                                  | 2018    | 2019    | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Sales                            | 18,121  | 19,482  | 19,535  |\n| Costs of materials used          | (4,826) | (5,321) | (5,240) |\n| Employee benefit expenses        | (5,827) | (6,307) | (6,490) |\n| Depreciation and amortization 1) | (1,089) | (1,402) | (1,520) |\n| Shipping and handling            | (605)   | (636)   | (689)   |\n| Advertising and promotion        | (937)   | (972)   | (920)   |\n| Lease expense 2) 3) 3)           | (225)   | (52)    | (36)    |\n| Other operational costs 4)       | (2,947) | (3,114) | (3,047) |\n| Other business income (expenses) | 55      | (34)    | (50)    |\n| Income from operations           | 1,719   | 1,644   | 1,542   |",

Dividend income from investments decreased by EUR 49 million versus prior year.\n\nIn 2019, Financial income and expenses were EUR 117 million, which was EUR 97 million lower than in 2018 mainly due to dividend income from investments, while 2018 included financial charges of EUR 46 million related to bonds redemptions. Net interest expense in 2019 was EUR 12 million higher than in 2018, mainly due to higher interest expenses on net debt *) .

This effect is partly offset by lower non-cash benefits from business integration compared to 2019.\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences, unused tax losses, and unused tax credits to the extent that realization of the related tax benefits is probable. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\n\nNet deferred tax assets relate to the following underlying assets and liabilities and tax loss carryforwards (including tax credit carryforwards) and their movements during the years 2020 and 2019 respectively are presented in the tables below.\n\nThe net deferred tax assets of EUR 1,761 million (2019: EUR 1,721 million) consist of deferred tax assets of EUR 1,820 million (2019:EUR 1,865 million) and deferred tax liabilities of EUR 59 million (2019: EUR 143 million). Of the total deferred tax assets of EUR 1,820 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 1,865 million), EUR 35 million (2019: EUR 239 million) is recognized in respect of entities in various countries where there have been tax losses in the current or preceding period. Management's projections support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the temporary differences associated with investments, including potential income tax consequences on dividends, for which no deferred tax liabilities are recognized, aggregate to EUR 275 million (2019: EUR 327 million).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities in millions of EUR\n\n|                                               | Balance as of January 1, 2020   | recognized in income statement   | other 1)   | Balance as of December 31, 2020   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Intangible assets                             | 132                             | 147                              | (39)       | 240                               | 379      | (140)         |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 58                              | (22)                             | (4)        | 32                                | 65       | (32)          |\n| Inventories                                   | 252                             | 77                               | (16)       | 313                               | 317      | (4)           |\n| Other assets                                  | 56                              | 37                               | 4          | 97                                | 135      | (38)          |\n| Pensions and other employee benefits          | 269                             | 4                                | (27)       | 245                               | 251      | (6)           |\n| Other liabilities                             | 334                             | 81                               | (30)       | 384                               | 436      | (52)          |\n| Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards | 620                             | (133)                            | (38)       | 449                               | 449      |               |\n| Set-off deferred tax positions                |                                 |                                  |            |                                   | (212)    | 212           |\n| Net deferred tax assets                       | 1,721                           | 190                              | (151)      | 1,761                             | 1,820    | (59)          |\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities in millions of EUR\n\n|                                               | Balance as of January 1, 2019   | recognized in income statement   | other 1)   | Balance as of December 31, 2019   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Intangible assets                             | (162)                           | 317                              | (23)       | 132                               | 280      | (148)         |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 12                              | 38                               | 8          | 58                                | 67       | (9)           |\n| Inventories                                   | 257                             | (6)                              | 1          | 252                               | 259      | (7)           |\n| Other assets                                  | 50                              | (15)                             | 21         | 56                                | 90       | (33)          |\n| Pensions and other employee benefits          | 267                             | 4                                | (1)        | 269                               | 270      | (1)           |\n| Other liabilities                             | 428                             | (119)                            | 25         | 334                               | 436      | (102)         |\n| Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards | 824                             | (231)                            | 27         | 620                               | 620      |               |\n| Set-off deferred tax positions                |                                 |                                  |            |                                   | (156)    | 156           |\n| Net deferred tax assets                       | 1,676                           | (13)                             | 59         | 1,721                             | 1,865    | (143)         |\n\nThe company has available tax loss and credit carryforwards, which expire as follows:",

For particular tax treatments that are not expected to be accepted by tax authorities, Philips either recognizes a liability or reflects the uncertainty in the recognition and measurement of its current and deferred tax assets and tax attributes. For the measurement of the uncertainty, Philips uses the most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment. The expected liabilities resulting from the uncertain tax treatments are included in non-current tax liabilities (2020: EUR 291 million, 2019: EUR 186 million, increase due to lower tax losses or similar tax carryforwards that can be used if uncertain tax treatments were settled for the presumed amount at balance sheet date). The positions include, among others, the following:\n\n## Transfer pricing risks\n\nPhilips has issued transfer pricing directives, which are in accordance with international guidelines such as those of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. In order to reduce the transfer pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried out by Group Tax to safeguard the correct implementation of the transfer pricing directives. However, tax disputes can arise due to inconsistent transfer pricing regimes and different views on \"at arm's length\" pricing.\n\n## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## Tax risks on general and specific service agreements and licensing agreements\n\nDue to the centralization of certain activities (such as research and development, IT and group functions), costs are also centralized. As a consequence, these costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the beneficiaries, i.e. the various Philips entities. For that purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service agreements and licensing agreements are signed with a large number of group entities. Tax authorities review these intra-group service and licensing agreements, and may reject the implemented intra-group charges. Furthermore, buy in/out situations in the case of (de)mergers could affect the cost allocation resulting from the intragroup service agreements between countries. The same applies to the specific service agreements.\n\n## Tax risks due to disentanglements and acquisitions\n\nWhen a subsidiary of Philips is disentangled, or a new company is acquired, tax risks may arise. Philips creates merger and acquisition (M&A) teams for these disentanglements or acquisitions. In addition to representatives from the involved business, these teams consist of specialists from various group functions and are formed, among other things, to identify tax risks and to reduce potential tax claims.\n\n## Tax risks due to permanent establishments\n\nA permanent establishment may arise when a Philips entity has activities in another country, tax claims could arise in both countries on the same income.",

The dividend was settled in July through the issuance of 18,080,198 new common shares. In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, per share calculations have been adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented to reflect the issuance of shares for the share dividend in respect of 2019.\n\nThe adjustment resulted in basic earnings per common share for income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for 2019 being adjusted downwards from EUR 1.31 to EUR 1.29 (2018: EUR 1.41 to EUR 1.38). Similarly, diluted earnings per common share for income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for 2019 was adjusted downwards from EUR 1.30 to EUR 1.27 (2018: EUR 1.39 to EUR 1.37).\n\nThe basic earnings per common share for net income attributable to shareholders for 2019 was adjusted downwards from EUR 1.29 to EUR 1.27 (2018: EUR 1.18 to EUR 1.16). Similarly, diluted earnings per common share for net income attributable to shareholders for 2019 was adjusted from EUR 1.28 to EUR 1.25 (2018: EUR 1.16 to EUR 1.14).",

The decrease is partially offset by goodwill increases from the acquisition of Intact Vascular for an amount of EUR 155 million and other acquisitions as well as changes in the provisional opening balance sheet position for certain 2019 acquisitions (refer to Acquisitions and divestments, starting on page 148).\n\nGoodwill increased by EUR 83 million in 2019 primarily as a result of several acquisitions of which none were individually material as well as changes in the provisional opening balance sheet position for certain 2018 acquisitions. The further increase of EUR 165 million is mainly due to translation differences which impacted the goodwill denominated in USD. These increases are offset by goodwill impairments identified in the second half of 2019 totaling EUR 97 million in the Population Insights & Care/Vital Health (PIC/VH) and Neuro cash generating units (CGUs),\n\n## Goodwill reallocations in 2020 and 2019\n\nIn Q4 2020, the PHM CGU was split, resulting in a separate CGU for the Aging and Caregiving (ACG) business in anticipation of its future divestment. After the PHM impairment, remaining goodwill was allocated to the ACG CGU and remaining\n\nIn 2019 there were several changes to the CGU structure following the reorganization announced in January 2019 in order to align business with customer needs. This resulted in goodwill reallocations across CGUs, none of which had a significant impact on headroom or lead to goodwill impairments.\n\nIn addition, there were also certain CGU movements and/or combinations within businesses that did not result in a reallocation of goodwill, but resulted in changes to the business structure. This did not have a significant impact on headroom or lead to goodwill impairments. In Q4 2019 CGU PIC/VH and Aging and Caregiving combined into one Population Health Management (PHM) CGU. Unrelated to this combination, prior to this in the third quarter of 2019, the then PIC/VH CGU recognized a goodwill impairment, further explained below.\n\n## Impairments\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the PHM CGU was split, resulting in a separate CGU for the ACG business in anticipation of its future divestment. The impairment test indicated that the pre-split PHM's carrying balance of EUR 303 million exceeded the recoverable amount of EUR 195 million, resulting in a EUR 108 million goodwill impairment charge. After the PHM impairment, further described below, remaining goodwill in the amount of EUR 63 million was allocated to the ACG CGU and remaining PHM CGU based on their relative fair value. Upon reallocation, standalone impairment tests were completed for ACG and the remaining PHM business. This second impairment test indicated that ACG's carrying balance of EUR 186 million exceeded the recoverable amount of EUR 150 million resulting in a EUR 36 million impairment charge. In total, EUR 144 million of impairment charges were recorded within the Connected Care segment, in the line Other business expenses in the statement of income.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS, the fair value less cost of disposal methodology was the basis used to estimate recoverable amount for these CGUs, as at the date of the impairment tests described above, the fair value less cost of disposal was higher than the value-in-use for these CGUs. The decline in the value-in-use as compared to the fair value less cost of disposal is mainly due to revisions to the financial forecast of our Personal Emergency Response System business as a result of lower demand. The fair value, determined by Management, reflects the current operating environment and business outlook, including COVID-19 uncertainties, for the PHM and ACG CGU. Refer to the 'Key assumptions- general' for further detail on the fair value methodology.",

Refer to Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale, starting on page 147 for further detail. Remaining PHM goodwill postreallocation totaled EUR 15 million.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, it was determined that the PIC/VH CGU within the segment Connected Care would miss its forecast mainly due to a deterioration in EBITA *) driven by a lower sales outlook in the former Wellcentive business within the CGU. The business offers services and solutions leveraging data, analytics and actionable workflow products for solutions to improve clinical and financial results. The value of the CGU, determined based on the value in use methodology, presented a recoverable amount of EUR 158 million based on the revised downward forecast, while the carrying amount totaled EUR 236 million as of September 30, 2019. The results of that impairment test indicated that the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a EUR 78 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2019, which was booked in the line Other business expenses in the statement of income. The value in use test used a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1%, which is based on the PIC/VH WACC rate for Q3 as calculated and published by Group Treasury.\n\nDuring December 2019, it was determined that the Neuro CGU within the segment D&T would be shut down. The Neuro business provided an integrated neurology solution comprising full head HD EEG with diagnostic imaging to map brain activity and anatomy for a wide range of neuro disorders, and uses machine learning to improve diagnosis of various neuro disorders. The value of the CGU based on the value in use test presented a recoverable amount of nil, while the carrying amount of goodwill totaled EUR 19 million at the time of impairment. This resulted in a write-off of the full goodwill balance and a EUR 19 million impairment charge, which was booked in the line Other business expenses in the statement of income.\n\n## Goodwill impairment testing\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (typically one level below segment level, i.e. at the business level), which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored internally for management purposes.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the cash generating units Image-Guided Therapy, Monitoring & Analytics and Sleep & Respiratory Care is considered to be significant in comparison to the total book value of goodwill for the Group at December 31, 2020. The amounts associated as of December 31, 2020 are presented below:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                           | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Image-Guided Therapy                                      | 2,673  | 2,610  |\n| Monitoring & Analytics                                    | 1,360  | 1,246  |\n| Sleep & Respiratory Care                                  | 2,071  | 1,915  |\n| Other (units carrying a non-significant goodwill balance) | 2,550  | 2,244  |\n| Book value                                                | 8,654  | 8,014  |\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the basis of the recoverable amount used in the annual impairment tests for the units disclosed further in this note is the value in use.\n\nThe fair value less cost to dispose methodology was used as a basis for the recoverable amount in the annual impairment test when greater than the valuein-use test. Refer to the 'key assumptions- general' section for further detail on the methodology.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty associated with the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company includes various scenarios in the business forecasting process and the most reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate is used as basis for the value-in-use test. While determining assumptions on COVID-19 recovery, management considered external factors including COVID-19 spread by country, specific dynamics for each CGU, other macroeconomic conditions as well as Philips specific assumptions, including expected customer capex spend and business market growth. Philips considered multiple scenarios for each market that included high, mid and low COVID recovery scenarios. The high recovery scenario suggests a more rapid recovery through the first half of the initial forecast period while the low scenario suggests a more prolonged recovery through the same period. By the end of the initial forecast period, all three scenarios converge to roughly the same market growth rates. Philips generally utilized the mid scenario forecasting short-term COVID-19 impacts with expected market recovery later in the initial forecast period. In addition, results of the goodwill impairment tests were analyzed to determine alignment with current market conditions. In the case that market data indicated that models didn't fully consider impacts of COVID-19 within the forecasts, Philips would reexamine key inputs, such as forecast inputs or discount rates used. Upon this review, no additional changes were required. There were certain CGUs that were more negatively impacted by COVID-19 than others. Amongst those, IGT within the D&T segment as well as the CGUs within Personal Health were negatively impacted. Considering the current headroom in these CGUs, any reasonable change in these assumptions reflecting increased COVID-19 risks or prolonged impact would not cause the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value. Refer to COVID-19, starting on page 142 for further detail on COVID-19 considerations.",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## Key assumptions - general\n\nKey assumptions used in the value-in-use impairment tests for the units were sales growth rates, EBITA% *) and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash flow projections were determined using Royal Philips managements' internal forecasts that cover an initial period from 2021 to 2024. Projections were extrapolated with stable or declining growth rates for a period of 3 years (2025-2027), after which a terminal value was calculated per 2028. For terminal value calculation, growth rates were capped at a historical long-term average growth rate. This represents a change in methodology from previous years as the explicit forecast increased from 3 to 4 years while the extrapolated growth period decreased from 4 to 3 years. The change in methodology from 2019 to 2020 was based on changes in the internal forecasting process.\n\nThe sales growth rates and EBITA *) used to estimate cash flows are based on past performance, external market growth assumptions and industry long-term growth averages. EBITA *) in all units mentioned in this note is expected to increase over the projection period as a result of volume growth and cost efficiencies.\n\nThe rates used for discounting the projected cash flows in goodwill impairment testing is based on a business weighted cost of capital (WACC), which in turn is based on business-specific inputs along with other inputs as mentioned below. The WACC is based on post-tax cost of equity and cost of debt, and is further calculated based on market data and inputs to accurately capture changes to the time value of money, such as the risk-free interest rate, the beta factor and country risk premium. In order to properly reflect the different risk-profiles of different businesses, a WACC is determined for each business. As such, the beta factor is determined based on a selection of peer companies, which can differ per business. Different businesses have different geographical footprints, resulting in business-specific inputs for variables like country risk.\n\nAs previously noted, the fair value less cost of disposal methodology was used as the recoverable amount when the amount was greater than the value-in-use, specifically for the PHM and ACG CGUs. The fair value is based on Level 3 inputs. Key assumptions and inputs used in the fair value less cost of disposal calculation include the trading and M&A peer groups used to determine the sales market multiples, the control premium applied to the trading sales market multiples. These inputs were applied against 2020 actual revenue for the CGUs. The trading and M&A peer groups were comprised of public companies or publicly disclosed transactions in similar industries, markets, geographies and other relevant characteristics. This trading and M&A peer group was derived from input by the business, M&A and Treasury and was evaluated and challenged for completeness and inclusion based on management's industry experience as well as the current business and market environment. External sources were used to determine the enterprise value and revenue for the trading peer group. A control premium was added to the trading sales market multiple to simulate the premium a market\n\nparticipant would pay, representing the high end of the range. The control premium was sourced from global public M&A transactions from 2019 and 2020. The sales market multiple with no premium represents the low end of the range. The recoverable amount for the test was a point in between the high and low end of the range.\n\n## Key assumptions and sensitivity analysis relating to cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated\n\nCash flow projections of Image-Guided Therapy, Monitoring & Analytics and Sleep & Respiratory Care are based on the key assumptions included in the table below, which were used in the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter. For certain CGUs, including M&A and S&RC, the initial forecast period projects negative growth as these businesses experienced benefits from COVID-19 in 2020.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Key assumptions 2020\n\n|                          | compound sales growth rate 1)   | compound sales growth rate 1)   | compound sales growth rate 1)       |                        |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                          | initial forecast period         | extra-polation period 2)        | used to calculate terminal value 3) | pre-tax discount rates |\n| Image-Guided Therapy     | 8.6%                            | 4.9%                            | 2.5%                                | 9.0%                   |\n| Monitoring & Analytics   | (0.3)%                          | 3.3%                            | 2.5%                                | 9.4%                   |\n| Sleep & Respiratory Care | (1.2)%                          | 4.4%                            | 2.5%                                | 9.7%                   |",

For more information, please refer to Acquisitions and divestments, starting on page 148. Impairments in 2020 were EUR 235 million. The most notable impairment in 2020 is in the Diagnosis & Treatment segment, for technology assets in Image Guided Therapy-Systems (IGT-Systems) of EUR 92 million. This impairment charge is based on a trigger-based test on the CGU EPD which is a business category and an innovator in image-guided procedures for cardiac arrhythmias (heart rhythm disorders). The impairment charge is a result of revisions to forecast due to delays in commercialization caused by the need to do more work on the maturity of the technology. The basis of the recoverable amount used in this test is the value in use and an after-tax discount rate of 6.92% is applied. After the impairment charge the recoverable amount of the related intangible assets is EUR 93 million.\n\nOther notable impairments are in the Diagnosis & Treatment segment, for product development under construction in IGT-Devices of EUR 22 million and in the Connected Care segment, for product development in the business Therapeutic Care (TC) of EUR 23 million and in the business Sleep & Respiratory Care (S&RC) of EUR 23 million. The impairments in the IGT-Devices and TC business are the\n\nresult of revision of strategies in the respective businesses and resulted in full impairment of the respective assets. The impairment in the business S&RC is due to delays in commercialization as a result of further product improvements in combination with expected COVID-19 market dynamics. After impairment the carrying value of the related intangible asset is EUR 70 million. The basis of the recoverable amount used in these tests is the value in use.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty associated with the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company includes various scenarios in the business forecasting process and the most reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate is used as basis for the value-in-use test. While determining assumptions on COVID-19 recovery, management considered external factors including COVID-19 spread by country, specific dynamics for each CGU, other macroeconomic conditions as well as Philips specific assumptions, including expected customer capex spend and business market growth. Philips considered multiple scenarios for each business that included high, mid and low COVID recovery scenarios. The high recovery scenario suggests a more rapid recovery, while the low scenario suggests a more prolonged recovery over several years. The mid scenario suggests short-term COVID-19 impacts with expected\n\n## 10.9 Group financial statements",

For the impairment tests on product development in the business S&RC Philips utilized a scenario forecasting shortterm COVID-19 impacts , which means a dip in demand post-COVID, with expected market recovery later in the forecast period. For the EPD impairment test, Philips used the high recovery scenario. A reasonably prolonged recovery would not materially affect the outcome of the impairment test. In addition, there were certain businesses that were more negatively impacted by COVID-19 than others. Amongst those, IGT within the D&T segment as well as the businesses within Personal Health were negatively impacted. Considering the current headroom in these CGUs, any reasonable change in these assumptions reflecting increased COVID-19 risks or prolonged impact would not cause the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value.

The main movement in Other non-current financial assets at FVTPL is related to the value adjustments through P&L, mainly due to fair value gains of EUR 133 million from investments in limited life funds (mainly Gilde Healthcare) and other investments. The fair value gains from investments in limited life funds is caused by certain IPO's of investments held by the limited life funds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other assets\n\n## Other non-current assets\n\nOther non-current assets in 2020 were EUR 66 million (2019: EUR 47 million).

Consequently, in the first half of 2020 Philips entered into four forward contracts for an amount of EUR 745 million to acquire 20 million shares with settlement dates varying between June 2021 and December 2021 and a weighted average forward price of EUR 36.40. As of December 31, 2020, all of these forward contracts were outstanding.\n\n## Share call options\n\nIn 2016 Philips purchased EUR and USD-denominated call options on its own shares to hedge options granted to employees up to 2013.\n\nIn 2020, the company unwound 498,144 EUR-denominated and 853,267 USDdenominated call options against the transfer of the same number of its own shares (1,351,411 shares) and an additional 31 million cash payment to the buyer of the call options.\n\nOn December 31, 2020, the remaining EUR-denominated options and USDdenominated options related to 670,456 and 274,315 shares respectively.\n\n## Shares cancellation\n\nIn June 2020 Philips completed the cancellation of 3,809,675 of its common shares (with a cost price of EUR 152 million). The cancelled shares were acquired as part of the Philips' EUR 1.5 billion share repurchase program announced on January 29, 2019.\n\n## Dividend distribution\n\n## 2020\n\nIn July 2020, Philips distributed a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, representing a total value of EUR 758 million including costs. The dividend was distributed in the form of shares only resulting in the issuance of 18,080,198 new common shares. Per share calculations have been adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented to reflect the issuance of shares for the share dividend in respect of 2019. Further reference is made to Earnings per share, starting on page 158.\n\nA proposal will be submitted to the 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to pay a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, in cash or shares at the option of the shareholders, against the net income of the Company for 2020.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn June 2019, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, representing a total value of EUR 775 million including costs. Shareholders could elect for a cash dividend or a share dividend. Approximately 42% of the shareholders elected for a share dividend, resulting in the issuance of 9,079,538 new common shares. The settlement of the cash dividend involved an amount of EUR 453 million (including costs).\n\n## 2018\n\nIn June 2018, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.80 per common share, representing a total value of EUR 738 million including costs.

Such limitations relate to common shares of EUR 182 million, as well as to legal reserves required by Dutch law included under retained earnings of EUR 626 million and unrealized gains related to cash flow hedges of EUR 23 million. The unrealized currency translation differences of EUR 58 million and unrealized losses related to fair value through OCI financial assets of EUR 305 million qualify as revaluation reserves and reduce the distributable amount due to the fact that these reserves are negative.",

In the United States, subsidiaries of the company have been named as potentially responsible parties in state and federal proceedings for the clean-up of certain sites.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation can change significantly due to the emergence of additional information regarding the extent or nature of the contamination, the need to utilize alternative technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well as changes in judgments and discount rates.\n\nApproximately EUR 91 million of the long-term provision is expected to be utilized after one to five years, with the remainder after five years.

The larger part of post-employment benefits are company pension plans, of which some are funded and some are unfunded. All funded post-employment benefit plans are considered to be related parties.\n\nMost employees that take part in a company pension plan are covered by defined contribution (DC) pension plans. The main DC plans are in the Netherlands and the United States. The company also sponsors a number of defined benefit (DB) pension plans. The benefits provided by these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation levels.\n\nThe company also sponsors a limited number of DB retiree medical plans. The benefits provided by these plans typically cover a part of the healthcare costs after retirement. None of these plans are individually significant to the company and are therefore not further separately disclosed.\n\nThe larger funded DB and DC plans are governed by independent Trustees who have a legal obligation to protect the interests of all plan members and operate under the local regulatory framework.\n\nThe DB plans in the United States (US) and Germany (DE) make up most of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and the net balance sheet position. The company also has DB plans in the rest of the world (Other); however these are individually not significant to the company and do not have a significantly different risk profile that would warrant separate disclosure.\n\nThe adjacent table provides a break-down of the present value of the funded and unfunded DBO, the fair value of plan assets and the net balance sheet position in the US, DE and Other.",

For the funding of any deficit in the US plan the Group adheres to the minimum funding requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.\n\nThe assets of the US funded pension plans are in Trusts governed by fiduciaries. The non-qualified pension plans that cover accrual above the maximum salary of the funded qualified plan are unfunded.\n\nThe company's qualified pension commitments in the United States are covered via the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) which charges a fee to US companies providing DB pension plans. The fee is also dependent on the amount of unfunded vested liabilities.\n\nIn continued efforts to de-risk the company's existing and ongoing DB pension plans, the company executed a lump-sum window and annuity purchase program during 2020 regarding the US funded pension plan. Both events have been recognized as a settlement with a combined loss of EUR 21 million in 2020.\n\n## Germany\n\nThe company has several DB plans in Germany which for the largest part are unfunded, meaning that after retirement the company is responsible for the benefit payments to retirees.\n\n## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\nDue to the relatively high level of social security in Germany, the company's pension plans mainly provide benefits for the higher earners. The plans are open for future pension accrual. Indexation is mandatory due to legal requirements. Some of the German plans have a DC design, but are accounted for as DB plans due to a legal minimum return requirement.\n\nCompany pension commitments in Germany are partly protected against employer bankruptcy via the 'Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein' which charges a fee to all German companies providing pension promises.\n\nPhilips is one of the sponsors of Philips Pensionskasse VVaG in Germany, which is a multi-employer plan. The plan is classified and accounted for as a DC plan.\n\n## Risks related to DB plans\n\nDB plans expose the company to various demographic and economic risks such as longevity risk, investment risks, currency and interest rate risk and in some cases inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed wage increase but more importantly in some countries where indexation of pensions is mandatory.\n\nThe company has an active de-risking strategy in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its DB plans. Liability-driven investment strategies, lump sum cash-out options, buy-ins, buy-outs and a change to DC are examples of the strategy. The lump-sum window and cash-out and annuity-purchase program in the US pension plan in 2020 as mentioned above are examples of that strategy.\n\n## Investment policy in our largest pension plans\n\nPension fund trustees are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets. The plan assets of the Philips pension plans are invested in well diversified portfolios. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio is closely aligned to that of the plan's pension liabilities for most of the plans. Any contributions from the sponsoring company are used to further increase the fixed income part of the assets. As part of the investment strategy, any improvement in the funded ratio over time is used to further decrease the interest rate mismatch between the plan assets and the pension liabilities.\n\n## Summary of pre-tax costs for post-employment benefits and reconciliations\n\nThe adjacent table contains the total of current and past service costs, administration costs and settlement results as included in Income from operations and the interest cost as included in Financial expenses.",

The DBO was recalculated using a change in the assumptions of 1% which overall is considered a reasonably possible change. The impact on the DBO because of changes in discount rate is normally accompanied by offsetting movements in plan assets, especially when using matching strategies.\n\nThe average duration of the DBO of the DB plans is 12 years (US: 12, DE: 11 and Other: 10) as per 31 December 2020 (2019: 11 years).\n\n## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions in millions of EUR\n\n|                               | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increase                      |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)   | (340)  | (226)  |\n| Inflation rate (1% movement)  | 113    | 86     |\n| Salary increase (1% movement) | 23     | 16     |\n| Longevity 1)                  | 90     | 51     |\n| Decrease                      |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)   | 401    | 265    |\n| Inflation rate (1% movement)  | (107)  | (78)   |\n| Salary increase (1% movement) | (22)   | (19)   |\n\n## Cash flows and costs in 2021\n\nThe company expects considerable cash outflows in relation to post-employment benefits which are estimated to amount to EUR 429 million in 2021, consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 EUR 30 million employer contributions to funded DB plans (US: EUR 0 million, DE: EUR 15 million, Other: EUR 15 million);\n- \u00b7 EUR 38 million cash outflows in relation to unfunded DB plans (US: EUR 9 million, DE: EUR 19 million, Other: EUR 10 million); and\n- \u00b7 EUR 361 million employer contributions to DC plans (NL: EUR 189 million, US: EUR 122 million, Other: EUR 50 million).\n\nThe service and administration cost for 2021 is expected to amount to EUR 42 million for DB plans.

Philips does not stand by other forms of support. The total fair value of guarantees recognized on the balance sheet amounts to EUR nil million for both 2019 and 2020. Remaining off-balance-sheet business related guarantees on behalf of third parties and associates decreased by EUR 5 million during 2020 to EUR 16 million (December 31, 2019: EUR 21 million).\n\n## Environmental remediation\n\nThe company and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Under these laws, the company and/or its subsidiaries may be required to remediate the effects of certain manufacturing activities on the environment.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nThe company and certain of its group companies and former group companies are involved as a party in legal proceedings, regulatory and other governmental proceedings, including discussions on potential remedial actions, relating to such matters as competition issues, commercial transactions, product liability, participations and environmental pollution.\n\nWhile it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of all pending or threatened legal proceedings, regulatory and governmental proceedings, the company is of the opinion that the cases described below may have, or have had in the recent past, a significant impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Civil Litigation\n\n## Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT)\n\nFollowing the public investigations into alleged anticompetitive activities in the Cathode Ray Tubes industry that began in 2007 and which resulted in a EUR 509 million fine against the company from the European Commission in December 2012, certain Philips Group companies were named as defendants in numerous (class action) lawsuits in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Israel. Plaintiffs in these cases varied\n\nBy the end of 2020, settlements have been reached in most of these cases. Litigation is still pending or threatened in relation to: (i) the revised US indirect purchaser class settlement which received approval from the District Court for the Northern District of California in July 2020 but is still subject to appeal, (ii) potential claims that may still be filed by certain objectors to the original US indirect purchaser class settlement (iii) a claim filed by the state attorney general for Puerto Rico, (iv) a claim filed by a monitor manufacturer in the UK, (v) a claim filed by three Brazilian TV manufacturers in the Netherlands, (vi) a consumer class action in Israel and (vii) a consumer action in the Netherlands.\n\nIn all cases, the same substantive allegations about anticompetitive activities in the CRT industry are made and damages are sought. Despite prior settlements, the company has concluded that due to the specific circumstances in the cases that settled, and the particularities and considerable uncertainty associated with the remaining matters, based on current knowledge, potential losses cannot be reliably estimated with respect to some of the matters that are still pending.\n\nIn 2019, the company was served with a claim filed by LG Electronics (LGE) in the Seoul Central District Court. LGE claims restitution of approximately EUR 210 million, representing a portion of the fine that LGE paid to the European Commission relating to the joint venture LG. Philips Displays for which LGE and the company were jointly and severally liable. LGE alleges that based on the manner in which the fine was calculated, the company should have paid proportionally more than it currently has. In November 2020, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed LGE's case. LGE has appealed the decision.\n\n## Public Investigations\n\nIn July 2018, the company was informed that the public prosecution service in Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE were conducting an investigation into tender irregularities in the medical device industry in Brazil. Philips was one of a number of companies involved in the investigation. After conducting an internal investigation into the matter focusing on certain transactions that took place before 2011, the company reached a leniency agreement with the Brazilian public prosecution service in 2020 under which the company agreed to pay EUR 9.7 million. The investigation by CADE is ongoing.\n\nIn respect of the investigation in Brazil, the company also received inquiries from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and US Department of Justice (DoJ). In addition, starting in June 2019, the company has engaged in discussions with and provided information to the SEC and DoJ regarding tender irregularities in the medical device industry in certain other jurisdictions.

In addition to the table above, as part of its S&RC operations in the US, Philips Medical Capital LLC funded durable medical equipment (DMEs) providers, through loans and leases. PMC-funded transactions these DMEs entered into with Philips amount to EUR 243 million in 2020 (2019: EUR 235 million; 2018: EUR 177 million). The associated costs of these funding transactions are borne by the ultimate customer and settled directly with Philips Medical Capital LLC.\n\nPhilips Medical Capital LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, is owned 60% by De Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. (DLL) and 40% by Philips Electronics North America Corporation (Philips).\n\nFor remuneration details of the Executive Committee, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board see Information on remuneration, starting on page 190.\n\nFor Post-employment benefit plans see Post-employment benefits, starting on page 179.\n\n## Share-based compensation 27\n\nThe purpose of the share-based compensation plans is to align the interests of management with those of shareholders by providing incentives to improve the company's performance on a long-term basis, thereby increasing shareholder value.\n\nThe company has the following plans:\n\n- \u00b7 performance shares: rights to receive common shares in the future based on performance and service conditions;\n- \u00b7 restricted shares: rights to receive common shares in the future based on a service condition; and\n- \u00b7 options on its common shares, including the 2012 and 2013 Accelerate! grant.\n\nSince 2013 the Board of Management and other members of the Executive Committee are only granted performance shares *) . Performance shares as well as restricted shares can be granted to executives, certain selected employees and new employees. Prior to 2013 options were also granted.\n\nUnder the terms of employee stock purchase plans established by the company in various countries, employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of Philips shares at discounted prices through payroll withholdings.\n\nShare-based compensation costs were EUR 121 million (2019: EUR 105 million; 2018: EUR 102 million). This includes the employee stock purchase plan of EUR 6 million, which is not a share-based compensation that affects equity. In the Consolidated statements of changes in equity EUR 116 million is recognized in 2020 and represent the costs of the share-based compensation plans. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted for forfeiture. USD-denominated performance shares, restricted shares and options are granted to employees in the United States only.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nThe performance is measured over a three-year performance period. The performance shares granted in 2019 and 2018 have two performance conditions, relative Total Shareholders' Return ('TSR') compared to a peer group of 20",

For performance shares granted in 2020 an additional non-financial criterion was added around sustainability. The introduction of the sustainability criterion reflects a further alignment of the remuneration package for the Board of Management with Philips' mission, vision and aim to act as a responsible member of society. The criterion is based on three Sustainable Development Goals ('SDG') as defined by the United Nations that are included in Philips' strategy on sustainability (refer to Environment, Social and Governance, starting on page 43).\n\nThe performance shares vest three years after the grant date. The number of performance shares that will vest is dependent on achieving the performance conditions provided that the grantee is still employed with the company. For the performance shares with a grant date in 2019 or 2018 the two financial conditions, TSR and EPS, are equally weighted, while for the performance shares with a grant date in 2020 the TSR is weighted 50%, EPS 40% and SDG 10%.\n\nThe amount recognized as an expense is adjusted for actual performance of adjusted EPS growth and the actual realization of the SDGs since these are nonmarket performance conditions. It is not adjusted for non-vesting or extra vesting of performance shares due to a relative TSR performance that differs from the performance anticipated at the grant date, since this is a market-based performance condition.\n\nThe fair value of the performance shares is measured based on Monte-Carlo simulation, which takes into account dividend payments between the grant date and the vesting date by including reinvested dividends as well as the market conditions expected to impact relative Total Shareholders' Return performance in relation to selected peers. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for the 2020 grants:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk-free rate: (0.74)%\n- \u00b7 Expected share price volatility: 25%\n\nThe assumptions were used for these calculations only and do not necessarily represent an indication of Management's expectation of future developments for other purposes. The company has based its volatility assumptions on historical experience measured over a ten-year period.\n\nA summary of the status of the company's performance share plans as of December 31, 2020 and changes during the year are presented below:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Performance shares\n\n|                                  | shares    | weighted average grant-date fair value   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|\n| EUR-denominated                  |           |                                          |\n| Outstanding at January 1, 2020   | 3,460,802 | 39.32                                    |\n| Granted                          | 1,201,093 | 44.30                                    |\n| Notional dividends 1)            | 70,865    | 41.27                                    |\n| Vested/Issued                    | 1,525,520 | 38.20                                    |\n| Forfeited                        | 223,040   | 40.13                                    |\n| Adjusted quantity 2)             | 561,111   | 38.30                                    |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2020 | 3,545,312 | 41.31                                    |\n| USD-denominated                  |           |                                          |\n| Outstanding at January 1, 2020   | 2,213,962 | 45.06                                    |\n| Granted                          | 892,939   | 48.26                                    |\n| Notional dividends 1)            | 48,548    | 46.99                                    |\n| Vested/Issued                    | 929,676   | 41.68                                    |\n| Forfeited                        | 159,526   | 46.52                                    |\n| Adjusted quantity 2)             | 346,520   | 42.34                                    |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2020 | 2,412,767 | 47.10                                    |\n\nAt December 31, 2020, a total of EUR 116 million of unrecognized compensation costs relate to non-vested performance shares (at December 31, 2019 EUR 106 million; at December 31, 2018 EUR 111 million).

The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be realized by the company upon maturity or disposal. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nThe following tables show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not carried at fair value is not included if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. As reflected in the following table, equity instruments carried at FVTOCI were designated as such upon the adoption of IFRS 9 and upon initial measurement of new equity instruments. Remaining financial assets are mandatorily classified as FVTPL or FVTOCI.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities in millions of EUR 2020\n\n|                                        | carrying amount   | estimated fair value 1)   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets                       |                   |                           |           |           |           |\n| Carried at fair value:                 |                   |                           |           |           |           |\n| Debt instruments                       | 207               | 207                       |           |           | 207       |\n| Equity instruments                     | 5                 | 5                         | 5         |           |           |\n| Other financial assets                 | 36                | 36                        |           | 30        | 5         |\n| Financial assets carried at FVTPL      | 248               | 248                       | 5         | 30        | 212       |\n| Debt instruments                       | 27                | 27                        |           | 27        |           |\n| Equity instruments                     | 119               | 119                       | 12        |           | 107       |\n| Current financial assets               | -

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.",

        "page_content": "## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\n## Level 2\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives or convertible bond instruments) is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 2. The fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. The valuation of convertible bond instruments uses observable market quoted data for the options and present value calculations using observable yield curves for the fair value of the bonds.\n\n## Level 3\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, such as third-party pricing information without adjustments, the instrument is included in level 3.\n\nPhilips recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nAs part of the EPD acquisition Philips may be required to pay additional consideration to former shareholders if specified future events occur or conditions are met, such as the achievement of certain regulatory milestones or the achievement of certain commercial milestones. The fair value of this contingent consideration provision was determined using a probability-weighted and a riskadjusted approach to estimate the achievement of future regulatory and commercial milestones, respectively. The discount rates used in the risk-adjusted approach are ranging from 7 to 9 percent and reflect the inherent risk related to achieving the commercial milestones. Both regulatory and commercial milestones are discounted for the time value of money at risk-free rates. The fair value measurement is based on management's estimates and assumptions and hence classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. For further information on this and other contingent consideration provisions (refer to Provisions, starting on page 176)\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the EPD contingent consideration provision at December 31, 2020 shows that if the probabilities of success for regulatory milestones are increased by 10 percentage points, with all other variables (including foreign exchange rates) held constant, the fair value of the provision would increase by approximately 9%. Similarly, a decrease in the probabilities of success for regulatory milestones by 10 percentage points would reduce the fair value by approximately 10%. If the discount rates for commercial milestones were to increase instantaneously by 100 basis points from the assumption at December 31, 2020, with all other variables (including foreign exchange rates) held constant,\n\nthe fair value of the provision would decrease by approximately 3%, while a decrease in the discount rates of 100 basis points would increase the fair value by approximately 4%.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty associated with the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company includes various scenarios in the business forecasting process and the most reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate is used as basis for the fair values calculation of contingent considerations. While determining assumptions on COVID-19 recovery, management considered external factors including COVID-19 spread by country, specific dynamics, other macroeconomic conditions as well as Philips specific assumptions, including expected customer capex spend and business market growth. Philips considered multiple scenarios for each business that included high, mid and low COVID recovery scenarios. The high recovery scenario suggests a more rapid recovery, while the low scenario suggests a more prolonged recovery over several years. The mid scenario suggests short-term COVID-19 impacts with expected market recovery earlier than the low scenario. For the determination of the fair value of contingent considerations Philips generally utilized the high recovery scenario. A reasonably prolonged recovery would not materially affect the fair value of the contingent consideration liability. Refer to COVID-19, starting on page 142 for further detail on COVID-19 considerations.\n\nThe table below shows the reconciliation from the beginning balance to the end balance for Level 3 fair value measurements.\n\nReconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                             | Financial assets   | Financial liabilities   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2020                  | 212                | 354                     |\n| Acquisitions                                |                    | 70                      |\n| Purchase                                    | 127                |                         |\n| Sales                                       | (60)               |                         |\n| Utilizations                                |                    | (15)                    |\n| Recognized in profit and loss:              |                    |                         |\n| other business income                       |                    | (93)                    |\n| financial income and expenses 1)            | 129                | 6                       |\n| Recognized in other comprehensive income 2) | (8)                | (6)                     |\n| Receivables held to collect and sell        | 11                 |                         |\n| Balance at December 31, 2020                | 411                | 318                     |",

As a result, Philips' future borrowing capacity may be influenced and its financing costs may fluctuate. Philips has various sources to mitigate the liquidity risk for the group. At December 31, 2020, Philips had EUR 3,226 million in cash and cash equivalents (2019: EUR 1,425 million), within which short-term deposits of EUR 1,983 million (2019: EUR 884 million). Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances, money market funds and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Philips pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible; cash not pooled remains available for the company's operational or investment needs.\n\nPhilips faces cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions in a few countries that could limit its ability to make these balances available on short notice for general use by the group.\n\nFurthermore, Philips has a USD 2.5 billion Commercial Paper Programme and a EUR 1.0 billion committed revolving credit facility that can be used for general group purposes, such as a backstop for its Commercial Paper Programme. As of December 31, 2020, Philips did not have any amounts outstanding under any of these facilities. As per 9 March 2020, Philips has established a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) program, a framework that facilitates the issuance of notes for a total amount up to EUR 10 billion of which two bonds have been issued in the year 2020 amounting to EUR 1 billion. A description of Philips' credit facilities can be found in Debt, starting on page 174.\n\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2020, Philips also held EUR 17 million of listed (level 1) equity investments at fair value (classified as other non-current financial assets).\n\nThe table below presents a summary of the Group's fixed contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2020. These amounts are an estimate of future payments which could change as a result of various factors such as a change in interest rates, foreign exchange, contractual provisions, as well as changes in our business strategy and needs.

As at December 31, 2020 capital contributions already made to these investment funds are recorded as non-current financial assets.\n\nPhilips offers voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to factor their trade receivables at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. Philips continues to recognize these liabilities as trade payables and settles them accordingly on the invoice maturity date based on the terms and conditions these arrangements . At December 31, 2020 approximately EUR 227 million of the Philips account payable were transferred under these arrangements.\n\n## Leasing activities\n\nThe company leases various items of real estate, vehicles and other equipment where it acts as a lessee. The company has multiple extension and termination options in a number of lease contracts. These are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the company's operations. The options considered reasonably certain are part of lease liabilities. However, the options not considered reasonably certain are not part of lease liability, which exposes the company to potential future cash outflows amounting to EUR 328 million.

Philips is exposed to currency risk in the following areas:\n\nThe company enters into sale and lease back transactions primarily for its Sleep & Respiratory Care businesses. These transactions are accounted for at market value. The payments for these leases are considered in determining lease liabilities. Principal repayments are part of cash flows used for financing activities and interest payments are part of cash flows used for operating activities. The cash inflows arising from the sales transactions, are part of cash flows provided by financing activities. Lease payments under sale-and-leaseback arrangements for 2020 were EUR 112 million (2019: EUR 108 million). The remaining minimum payment under sales-and-leaseback arrangements included in lease obligations above are as follows:\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Lease - minimum payments under sale-and-leaseback arrangements in millions of EUR\n\n| 2021       |   85 |\n|------------|------|\n| 2022       |   65 |\n| 2023       |   44 |\n| 2024       |   27 |\n| 2025       |   11 |\n| Thereafter |   18 |\n\nPhilips has leasing activities where it acts as lessor. In such arrangements, Philips provides the customer with a right to use of medical equipment in exchange for a series of payments. Residual values of assets under lease form an insignificant part of the carrying amount of those assets. Residual values are influenced by asset market prices and are therefore subject to management estimation. Residual values are at least reassessed on an annual basis, or more often when necessary. Reassessments are based on a combination of realization of assets sold, expert knowledge and judgment of local markets. For lease receivables, the value of unguaranteed residual values on December 31, 2020 was EUR 0.2 million (2019: EUR 0.7 million). In order to reduce residual value risk exposures there may be residual value guarantees or purchase options embedded in the customer contract. Credit risk for lease receivables is reviewed regularly and mitigated, for example, by retaining a security interest in the leased asset.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that reported financial performance or the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

In general, net anticipated exposures for the Group are hedged during a period of 15 months in layers of 20% up to a maximum hedge of 80%. Philips' policy requires significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally using forwards. However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Philips from effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and committed transaction exposures.\n\nThe following table outlines the estimated nominal value in millions of EUR for committed and anticipated transaction exposure and related hedges for Philips' most significant currency exposures consolidated as of December 31, 2020:",

The derivatives related to transactions are, for hedge accounting purposes, split into hedges of on-balance-sheet accounts receivable/ payable and forecasted sales and purchases. Changes in the value of on-balance-sheet foreign-currency accounts receivable/payable, as well as the changes in the fair value of the hedges related to these exposures, are reported in the income statement under costs of sales. Hedges related to forecasted transactions, where hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The results from such hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income within equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. As of December 31, 2020, a gain of EUR 23 million was deferred in equity as a result of these hedges (2019: EUR 24 million loss). The result deferred in equity will be released to earnings mostly during 2021 at the time when the related hedged transactions affect the income statement. During 2020, EUR nil million (2019: EUR 0.8 million net gain) was recorded in the consolidated statement of income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain anticipated cash flow hedges. Ineffectiveness arises when anticipated exposures are no longer expected to be highly probable. During 2020, a gain of EUR 28 million included in the cash flow hedges reserve in equity pertaining to changes in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts\n\n## 10.9 Group financial statements\n\nattributable to forward points and changes in the time value of option contracts was released to income statement.\n\nThe total net fair value of hedges related to transaction exposure as of December 31, 2020, was an unrealized gain of EUR 26 million. The estimated impact of a 10% increase of value of the EUR is estimated to be EUR 136 million. The following table contains an overview of the instantaneous 10% increase in the value of EUR against major currencies.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Estimated impact of 10% increase of value of the EUR on the fair value of hedges in millions of EUR\n\n|     |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-----|--------|--------|\n| USD |     85 |     71 |\n| JPY |     19 |     17 |\n| GBP |     14 |     15 |\n| CHF |      5 |      6 |\n| PLN |      9 |      8 |\n| RUB |      3 |      8 |\n\nThe EUR 136 million increase includes a gain of EUR 11 million that would impact the income statement, which would largely offset the opposite revaluation effect on the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and the remaining gain of EUR 125 million would be recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow hedges were effective.\n\nForeign exchange exposure also arises as a result of inter-company loans and deposits. Where the company enters into such arrangements, the financing is generally provided in the functional currency of the subsidiary entity. The currency of the company's external funding and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries, either directly through external foreign currency loans and deposits, or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives, including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. In certain cases where group companies may also have external foreign currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged through the use of foreign exchange derivatives. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to this exposure are recognized within financial income and expenses in the statements of income. When such loans would be considered part of the net investment in the subsidiary, net investment hedging would be applied.\n\nTranslation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is generally not hedged. If a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment hedge. Net current-period change, before tax, of the currency translation reserve of negative EUR 1,040 million mainly relates to the",

At December 31, 2020, a weakening of USD by 10% versus the EUR would result in a decrease in the currency translation reserve in equity of approximately EUR 787 million, while a strengthening of USD by 10% versus the EUR would result in an increase in the currency translation reserve in equity of approximately EUR 962 million. Refer to the country risk paragraph for countries with significant foreign currency denominated equity invested.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, cross-currency interest rate swaps for a nominal value of USD 500 million (liability at fair value: EUR 83 million) and external bond funding for a nominal value of USD 1,473 million (liability at book value: EUR 1,210 million) were designated as net investment hedges of our financing investments in foreign operations for an equal amount. During 2020 a total gain of EUR 0.2 million was recognized in the income statement as ineffectiveness on net investment hedges, arising from counterparty and own credit risk.\n\nThe total net fair value of financing derivatives as of December 31, 2020, was a liability of EUR 83 million. An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the EUR against all currencies would lead to an increase of EUR 53 million in the value of the derivatives, including a EUR 86 million increase related to the USD.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, cross-currency interest rate swaps for a nominal value of USD 500 million (liability at fair value: EUR 123 million) and external bond funding for a nominal value of USD 1,473 million (liability at book value: EUR 1,328 million) were designated as net investment hedges of our financing investments in foreign operations for an equal amount. During 2019 a total loss of EUR nil million was recognized in the income statement as ineffectiveness on net investment hedges, arising from counterparty and own credit risk.\n\nThe total net fair value of financing derivatives as of December 31, 2019, was a liability of EUR 123 million. An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the EUR against all currencies would lead to an increase of EUR 7 million in the value of the derivatives, including a EUR 53 million increase related to the USD.\n\nPhilips does not currently hedge the foreign exchange exposure arising from equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and other non-current financial assets.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Philips had, at year-end, outstanding debt of EUR 6,934 million (2019: EUR 5,447 million), which constitutes an inherent interest rate risk with potential negative impact on financial results. At year-end, Philips held EUR 3,226 million in cash and cash equivalents (2019: EUR 1,425 million), and had total long-term debt of EUR 5,705\n\nmillion (2019: EUR 4,939 million) and total short-term debt of EUR 1,229 million (2019: EUR 508 million) At December 31, 2020, Philips had a ratio of fixed-rate long-term debt to total outstanding debt of approximately 79% compared to 87% one year earlier. Philips debt has a long maturity profile with an average tenor of long-term debt of 6.3 years with maturities up to 2042.\n\nThe table below provides the impact of a 1% increase/decrease of interest rates on the fair value of the debt and the annualized net interest expenses.\n\n## Net debt 1) and interest rate sensitivity in millions of EUR Philips Group\n\n|                                                                                      | 2019   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Impact 1% interest increase on the fair value of the fixed-rate long-term debt 2) 3) | (300)  | (345)  |\n| Impact 1% interest decrease on the fair value of the fixed-rate long-term debt 2) 3) | 301    | 346    |\n| Impact 1% interest increase on the annualized net interest expense 4)                | 11     | 28     |\n\nGlobal regulators and central banks have been driving international efforts to reform key benchmark interest rates (Interbank Offered Rate or IBOR rates). The market is therefore in transition to alternative risk-free reference rates (RFRs) that are transaction-based. LIBOR discontinuation after 31 December 2021 is widely expected by market participants. The company is in the process of evaluating the implications of such a phase out. The Company has no interest rate hedging relationships which get affected by the reform and do not expect any significant impact on existing contracts due to change in the interest rates. The company will continue to monitor market developments.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nEquity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in equity prices.\n\nPhilips is a shareholder in some publicly listed companies and as a result is exposed to potential financial loss through movements in their share prices. The aggregate equity price exposure in such financial assets amounted to approximately EUR 17 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 15 million). Philips",

Philips also has shareholdings in several privately-owned companies amounting to EUR 107 million, mainly consisting of minority stakes in companies in various industries. As a result, Philips is exposed to potential value adjustments.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in commodity prices.\n\nPhilips is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals and energy. Philips may hedge certain commodity price risks using derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, Philips did not have any significant outstanding financial commodity derivatives.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date, if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as contracted. Credit risk is present within Philips trade receivables and contract assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Philips performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances where the creditworthiness of a customer is determined not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required, there are a number of mitigation tools that can be utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment terms, cash on delivery, pre-payments and pledges on assets.\n\nPhilips invests available cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and is exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. Philips is also exposed to credit risks in the event of non-performance by financial institutions with respect to financial derivative instruments. Philips actively manages concentration risk and on a daily basis measures the potential loss under certain stress scenarios, should a financial institution default. These worst-case scenario losses are monitored and limited by the company.\n\nThe company does not enter into any financial derivative instruments to protect against default by financial institutions. However, where possible the company requires all financial institutions with which it deals in derivative transactions to complete legally enforceable netting agreements under an International Swap Dealers Association master agreement or otherwise prior to trading, and whenever possible, to have a strong credit rating. Philips also regularly monitors the development of the credit risk of its financial counterparties. Wherever possible, cash is invested and financial transactions are concluded with financial institutions with strong credit ratings or with governments or government-backed institutions.\n\nThe table below shows the number of financial institutions with credit rating Aand above with which Philips has cash at hand and short-term deposits above EUR 10 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Philips Group\n\nCredit risk with number of counterparties for deposits above EUR 10 million\n\n|                               | 10-100 million   | 100-500 million   | 500 million and above   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| AA- rated bank counterparties |                  |                   |                         |\n| A+ rated bank counterparties  | 2                | 3                 | 1                       |\n| A rated bank counterparties   | 1                |                   | 1                       |\n| A- rated bank counterparties  |                  | 3                 |                         |\n|                               | 3                | 6                 | 2                       |\n\nFor an overview of the overall maximum credit exposure related to debt instruments, derivatives and loans and receivables, please refer to Fair value of financial assets and liabilities, starting on page 193.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk that political, legal, or economic developments in a single country could adversely impact our performance. The country risk per country is defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third parties and intercompany accounts receivable. The country risk is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the company had country risk exposure of EUR 10.5 billion in the United States, EUR 1.2 billion in China (including Hong Kong). Other countries higher than EUR 500 million are Japan EUR 684 million and the United Kingdom EUR 726 million. Other countries which have significant exposure are Germany EUR 300 million and India EUR 299 million. The degree of risk of a country is taken into account when new investments are considered. The company does not, however, use financial derivative instruments to hedge country risk.\n\nThe impact of hyperinflation is also routinely assessed and was not material for the periods presented.\n\n## Other insurable risks\n\nPhilips is covered for a broad range of losses by global insurance policies in the areas of property damage/ business interruption, general and product liability, transport, directors' and officers' liability, employment practice liability, crime and cybersecurity.

As a rule, Philips only selects insurance companies with a financial strength of at least A-. Throughout the year the counterparty risk is monitored on a regular basis.\n\nTo lower exposures and to avoid potential losses, Philips has a global Risk Engineering program in place. The main focus of this program is on property damage and business interruption risks including company interdependencies. Regular on-site assessments take place at Philips locations and business-critical suppliers by risk engineers of the insurer in order to provide an accurate assessment of the potential loss and its impact. The results of these assessments are shared across the company's stakeholders. On-site assessments are carried out against the predefined Risk Engineering standards, which are agreed between Philips and the insurers. Recommendations are made in a Risk Improvement report and are monitored centrally. This is the basis for decision-making by the local management of the business as to which recommendations will be implemented.\n\nFor all policies, deductibles are in place, which vary from EUR 0.3 million to EUR 5 million per occurrence and this variance is designed to differentiate between the existing risk categories within Philips. Above a first layer of working deductibles, Philips operates its own re-insurance captive, which during 2020 retained EUR 5 million per claim and EUR 10 million in the annual aggregate for general, product and professional liability claims.\n\nNew contracts were signed effective December 31, 2020, for the coming year, whereby the re-insurance captive retentions remained unchanged.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Subsequent events 31\n\n## BioTelemetry\n\nOn December 18, 2020, Philips and BioTelemetry, Inc. (BioTelemetry) announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. BioTelemetry is a leading U.S.-based provider of remote cardiac diagnostics and monitoring. The acquisition is part of the Philips strategy to be a leading provider of patient care management solutions. On February 9, 2021, Philips completed a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of BioTelemetry for USD 72.00 per share. The total equity purchase price and the settlement of stock option rights, including BioTelemetry's cash and debt, involved an amount of USD 2.8 billion (approximately EUR 2.3 billion). BioTelemetry and its approximately 1,900 employees form part of Philips' Connected Care business segment. Philips consolidates 100% of BioTelemetry as of the acquisition date. Due to the recent closing date, additional IFRS disclosures cannot be made until the initial accounting for the business combination has been completed.\n\n## Capsule Technologies\n\nOn January 19, 2021, Philips announced it had signed an agreement to acquire Capsule Technologies, Inc., a global leader in medical device integration and data technologies for hospitals and healthcare organizations. The acquisition will become part of Philips' Connected Care segment and expand Philips' patient care management solutions for all care settings. Philips will acquire Capsule Technologies for a cash consideration of USD 635 million (approximately EUR 520 million based on the relevant exchange rate on the agreement date). The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory clearances in relevant jurisdictions, and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## New credit facilities\n\nIn February 2021, Philips entered and has drawn two new bilateral loans amounting to total EUR 500 million (EUR 250 million each) with a tenor of up to one year. These loans will be used for general group purposes and will strengthen the liquidity position of the company.",

These statements are subject to adoption by the Company's shareholders at the upcoming 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nA description of the Company's activities and group structure is included in the Group financial statements, starting on page 119.\n\nRoyal Philips has its registered address at High Tech Campus 52, 5656 AG Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and is registered with the trade register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under number 17001910.\n\nPlease refer to Forward-looking statements and other information, starting on page 237 for more information about forward-looking statements, third-party market share data, fair value information, and revisions and reclassifications.\n\n## Accounting policies applied\n\nThe financial statements including the notes thereon have been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Section 2:362 (8) of the Dutch Civil Code, allows companies that apply IFRS as endorsed by the European Union in their consolidated financial statements to use the same measurement principles in their company financial statements.

Goodwill paid upon acquisition of investments in group companies or associates is included in the net equity value of the investment and is not shown separately on the face of the balance sheet. Loans provided to group companies are stated at amortized cost, less impairment. The Company makes use of the option to eliminate intercompany expected credit losses against the book value of loans and\n\nreceivables to group companies, instead of elimination against the investments in group companies.\n\n## Presentation of Company financial statements\n\nThe structure of the Company balance sheets and Company statements of income are aligned as much as possible with the Consolidated statements in order to achieve optimal transparency between the Group financial statements and the Company financial statements.\n\nThe Company balance sheet has been prepared before the appropriation of results.",

Financial income related to intercompany financing transactions mainly decreased due to the conversion of intercompany loans to equity in the US. Financial income related to Other financial assets mainly increased due to the value adjustments through P&L of investment in Gilde Healthcare of EUR 137 million caused by certain IPO's of investments held by the limited life funds. For further details on Other financial assets refer to note Other financial assets, starting on page 210.\n\nFinancial expenses mainly relates to interest paid on external debt of EUR 121 million (2019: EUR 125 million) and the value adjustments related to Other financial assets of EUR 25 million (2019: EUR 33 million).\n\n## Income tax\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. is head of the fiscal unity that exists for Dutch corporate income tax purposes.\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 deviates compared to the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25%, mainly due to results relating to participations, as the income tax expense of EUR 98 million represents the consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense for Koninklijke Philips N.V. and all of the members of the fiscal unity.

        "page_content": "## 11.4 Company financial statements\n\n## Share repurchase methods for share-based remuneration plans and capital reduction purposes\n\nPhilips uses different methods to repurchase shares in its own capital: (i) share buyback repurchases in the open market via an intermediary; (ii) repurchase of shares via forward contracts for future delivery of shares; and (iii) the unwinding of call options on own shares. During 2020, Philips used methods (i) and (ii) to repurchase shares for capital reduction purposes and methods (ii) and (iii) to repurchase shares for share-based compensation plans.\n\n## Forward share repurchase contracts\n\n## Forward contracts to repurchase shares for share-based compensation plans\n\nOn January 29, 2020, Philips announced that it will repurchase up to 6 million shares to cover certain of its obligations arising from its long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans. Under this program, Philips entered into three forward contracts for an amount of EUR 174 million to acquire 5,000,000 shares with settlement dates varying between October 2021 and November 2022 and a weighted average forward price of EUR 34.85. No further transactions are expected in respect to this program.\n\nOn October 22, 2018, Philips announced and started a share repurchase program for an amount of up to EUR 174 million to cover its long-term incentive and employee stock purchase plans, after which it repurchased shares via an intermediary to allow for buybacks in the open market during both open and closed periods. On November 12, 2018, Philips announced to extend this program and entered into three forward contracts for an amount of EUR 319 million to repurchase 10 million shares with settlement dates varying between October 2019 and November 2021 and a weighted average forward price of EUR 31.89. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 8 million shares under this program were acquired (4 million of which were settled in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020). This resulted in EUR 256 million increase in retained earnings against treasury shares (EUR 130 million and EUR 126 million pertaining to 2019 and 2020 respectively).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining forward contracts to cover obligations under share-based remuneration plans related to 7 million shares.\n\n## Forward contracts to repurchase shares for capital reduction purposes\n\nOn January 29, 2019, Philips announced a share buyback program for an amount of up to EUR 1.5 billion. Philips started the program in the first quarter of 2019. On March 23, 2020, Philips announced that 50.3% of the program had been completed through repurchases by an intermediary to allow for purchases in the open market during both open and closed periods, and that the remainder of the program would be executed through one or more individual forward transactions. Consequently, in the first half of 2020 Philips entered into four forward contracts\n\nfor an amount of EUR 745 million to acquire 20 million shares with settlement dates varying between June 2021 and December 2021 and a weighted average forward price of EUR 36.40. As of December 31, 2020, all of these forward contracts were outstanding.\n\n## Share call options\n\nIn 2016 Royal Philips purchased EUR and USD-denominated call options on its own shares to hedge options granted to employees up to 2013.\n\nIn 2020, the company unwound 498,144 EUR-denominated and 853,267 USDdenominated call options against the transfer of the same number of Royal Philips shares (1,351,411 shares) and an additional 31 million cash payment to the buyer of the call options.\n\nOn December 31, 2020, the remaining EUR-denominated options and USDdenominated options related to 670,456 and 274,315 shares respectively.\n\n## Shares cancellation\n\nIn June 2020 Royal Philips completed the cancellation of 3,809,675 of its common shares (with a cost price of EUR 152 million). The cancelled shares were acquired as part of the Philips' EUR 1.5 billion share repurchase program announced on January 29, 2019.\n\n## Dividend distribution\n\n## 2020\n\nIn July 2020, Philips distributed a dividend of EUR 0.85 per common share, representing a total value of EUR 758 million including costs.

In order to compensate for the limitations related to physical presence and direct observation, we performed alternative procedures (for example for certain locations where we were unable to attend inventory observations physically due to restrictions, we performed inventory observations using remote viewing technology) to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\n| Materiality   | EUR 75 million                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Benchmark     | 5% of income before taxes                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Explanation   | Based on our professional judgment we consider an earnings-based measure as the most appropriate basis to determine materiality. The applied benchmark and materiality are in line with the 2019 audit. |\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 3.75 million, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nKoninklijke Philips N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the group financial statements of Koninklijke Philips N.V.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for components. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the components. On this basis, we selected components for which an audit had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nFollowing our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to Koninklijke Philips N.V.'s group financial statements, we have selected 9 components which required an audit of the complete financial information (Full Scope components). Furthermore, we selected 33 components requiring audit procedures on specific account balances or specified audit procedures on significant accounts that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the group financial statements, either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile (Specific- or Specified Scope components). We performed audit procedures ourselves on certain accounting areas managed centrally, such as capitalized development costs, restructuring costs, health systems revenue (excluding US and Canada), payroll, acquisitions and goodwill. In addition to the procedures performed by the component teams, we had involvement in certain aspects of the audit of tax, legal claims, litigation and contingencies and Personal Health revenue (for a number of countries).\n\nOf the remaining components, we performed selected other procedures, including analytical review and test of details to respond to potential risks of material misstatements to the financial statements that we identified.\n\nAs a result of our scoping of the complete financial information, specific account balances and the performance of audit procedures at different levels in the organization, our actual coverage varies per financial statement account balance and the depth of our audit procedures per account balance varies depending on our risk assessment.\n\nAccordingly, our audit coverage, for selected account balances included in the key audit matters stated below, are summarized as follows:\n\n## Sales in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Full scope           | 31%   |\n|----------------------|-------|\n| Specific scope       | 28%   |\n| Specified procedures | 41%   |\n\n## Goodwill in %\n\nFull scope\n\n100%",

        "page_content": "## 12.2 Other information\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nComponent performance materiality was determined using judgment, based on the relative size of the component and our risk assessment. Component performance materiality did not exceed EUR 37.5 million and the majority of our component auditors applied a component performance materiality that is significantly less than this threshold.\n\nBecause of the international travel restrictions and social distancing requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been unable to visit management and/or component auditors to perform our oversight procedures on site. Instead, we predominantly used video or teleconferencing facilities, as well as EY's electronic audit file platform and screen sharing to communicate with component audit teams. Our communication included discussions relating to, among others, the business activities and the identified significant risks and/or to review and evaluate relevant parts of the component auditor's audit documentation and to discuss significant matters arising from their audit procedures and our evaluation, in order to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence.\n\nWe hosted virtual global audit meetings with component auditors to discuss the group audit, risks, audit approach and instructions. In addition, we sent instructions to component auditors, covering the significant areas and the information required to be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we held virtual site visits at component locations in the U.S.A., China, Germany, the Netherlands, Panama, India, Poland, Indonesia, and Russia. These virtual site visits encompassed some, or all, of the following activities: co-developing the significant risk area audit approach, reviewing key local working papers and conclusions, meeting with local and regional management teams and obtaining an understanding of key processes including centralized entity level controls processes. We interacted regularly with the component teams during various stages of the audit, through the use of video or teleconferencing facilities. Where deemed appropriate, we attended certain Full and Specific Scope component closing meetings with management, also using video or teleconferencing facilities. We reviewed key working papers of component auditors using the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or by the provision of copies of work papers direct to the group audit team.\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at components, together with additional procedures at the central level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion on the group financial statements.\n\n## Teaming, use of specialists\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the health technology industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT\n\naudit, forensics, treasury, share based payments and income tax and have made use of our own valuation experts and actuarial specialists.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the Company that may have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nIn order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal control.\n\nWe considered available information and made inquiries of relevant executives, directors (including internal audit, legal, compliance, and regional directors) and the Supervisory Board, as to their knowledge of actual fraud or the risks thereof. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption, in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We refer to our Key Audit Matter related to Revenue recognition - sales-related accruals and installable sales orders for further information, as to our procedures in this regard.\n\nGiven the Company is a global organization, operating in multiple jurisdictions, in our fraud risk assessment, we also considered the potential risk from Philips' interactions with third-party distributors and governmental agencies, including the risk of bribery and corruption. We refer to our Key Audit Matter related to Valuation and disclosure of provisions for legal claims, litigations and contingencies for further information, as to our procedures in this regard. In our process of identifying fraud risks, we considered whether the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to specific fraud risk factors resulting from a dilution in the effectiveness of controls as a result of the general disruption associated with remote working, illness, supply chain failures and pressure to make emergency procurements, management overrides and workarounds, manual invoicing and manual payments and abuse of government schemes intended to support companies during the pandemic. Conversely, we also considered whether there was an incentive or",

In addition, we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in note 1, starting on page 128 to the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. If so, we reevaluated our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on our audit procedures.\n\n## Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through discussions with the Board of Management, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports and performing test of controls, substantive tests of details on classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.\n\nWe also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known or alleged instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\nWe refer to our Key Audit Matter related to the Valuation and disclosure of provisions for legal claims, litigations and contingencies for further information as to our procedures in this regard.\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe performed the following procedures in order to identify and assess the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting. The Board of Management made a specific assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the assessment with the Board of Management, exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism, and specifically focusing on the process followed by the Board of Management to make the assessment, management bias that could represent a risk, the impact of current events and conditions have on the Company's operations and forecasted\n\ncash flows, with a focus on whether the Company will have sufficient liquidity to continue to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\nWe consider based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## General audit procedures\n\nOur audit further included among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. In comparison with previous year, our key audit matter topics did not change.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

Auditing the Company's measurement of sales related accruals relating to rebates, promotional and marketing support is especially complex because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions around the extent to which promotional or marketing targets will be met by Philips' customers and the related rebates will be owed.    |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | In addition, the sales in the Diagnosis & Treatment (D&T) and Connected Care (CC) business of the Company include the sale of equipment which requires installation and formal acceptance by the customer before revenue can be recognized (installable sales orders). There is a risk of management accelerating revenues through inappropriate top side journal entries or override of customer acceptance controls for installable sales orders. Auditing the Company's occurrence of revenues for installable sales orders requires auditor's judgment in selecting the items to be tested and determining the appropriate testing period.                |\n|                    | Further reference is made to note 1, Significant accounting policies, starting on page 128, and note 7, Income from operations, starting on page 150 section Sales composition and disaggregation, to the group financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Our audit approach | As part of our audit procedures, we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to measurement for sales-related accruals and the occurrence of revenues for installable sales orders. This included testing controls relating to management's verification that sales-related accruals have been reviewed and underlying assumptions were based on management's best estimate. We also tested controls over customer's acceptance of installed equipment and verification of revenues recorded through manual journal entries. |\n|                    | With respect to the sales-related accruals, we evaluated management's assumptions (as described above) by performing, among other procedures, a retrospective review of actual settlements of prior period sales-related accruals, confirmed the agreed upon terms and conditions for a sample of customer contracts and performed cut off testing through assessing the sales promotions obligations around year-end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                    | Furthermore, we have tested, among other procedures, revenue transactions before and after period-end for installable sales orders by obtaining formal customer acceptance documentation to evidence occurrence of revenues in the appropriate period.

Further reference is made to note 1, Significant accounting policies, and note 12, Goodwill, to the group financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | IAS 36 defines the recoverable amount as the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (ViU). As of December 31, 2020, management used the FVLCD to determine the recoverable amount for the CGUs PHM and ACG. The FVLCD reflects the current operating environment and business outlook, including management's plan to sell the ACG business, and also reflecting ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                    | Auditing the calculation of the recoverable amount for the CGUs PHM and ACG, was complex and judgmental, due to the significant estimation required in determining the recoverable amounts. The most significant judgments used were the determination of the peer group used to determine quoted market multiples, the appropriate control premium to apply and the selected multiple chosen to represent the fair value of the CGUs. Auditing these judgments involved complex auditor judgment because of the subjectivity in determining the peer group and the appropriate revenue multiple, including control premium, to represent the fair value of the CGUs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Our audit approach | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's goodwill impairment review process related to the CGUs PHM and ACG, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions and controls over the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models used.

We tested the control premium used by management by comparing it to external data, such as independent control premium studies. Additionally, we tested the accuracy of the sales data used by management in the calculation (to which the market multiple is applied). We also performed an analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to changes in the assumptions. We involved in our team a valuation specialist to assist us in these audit procedures. |\n|                    | We also assessed the adequacy of management's disclosure of the goodwill impairment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Key observations   | We consider management's assumptions and data used to calculate the recoverable amount to be reasonable and the impairment charge recorded to be appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                    | We agree with management's conclusion that no further impairment of goodwill is required in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                    | We assessed that the disclosures in the group financial statements are adequate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

allegations and test the Company's accounting and disclosure for (contingent) legal provisions, we discussed the allegations with both internal and external legal counsel, as well as with the Company's finance department, inspected relevant correspondence with authorities, inspected the minutes of the meetings of the Audit Committee, Supervisory Board and Executive Committee, requested a confirmation letter from the Company's in-house legal counsel and obtained external legal confirmation letters from a selection of external legal counsel. For claims settled during the year, we vouched the cash payments, as appropriate, and read the related settlement agreements. Specifically related to ongoing investigations into alleged non-compliance with laws and regulations, we were supported by EY fraud investigation specialists. We also assessed the adequacy of the Company's disclosure around legal claims, litigations and contingencies, as included in the group financial statements.. |\n|                    | We consider the Board of Management's conclusion on the expected outcome and estimation of potential impact reasonable and we assessed that the disclosures in the group financial statements, are adequate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Report on other information included in the annual report\n\nIn addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 The management report as defined in the introduction paragraph to the group financial statements\n- \u00b7 The remuneration report included in the Supervisory Board Report\n- \u00b7 Other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n\nBased on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:\n\n- \u00b7 Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements\n- \u00b7 Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 and Sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub-section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n\nWe have read the other information.

Overbeek - Goeseije\n\n## Reconciliation of non-IFRS information 12.3\n\nIn this Annual Report Philips presents certain financial measures when discussing Philips' performance that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS ('non-IFRS'). These non-IFRS measures (also known as non-GAAP or alternative performance measures) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of Philips' performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which Philips operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. Philips believes that an understanding of its sales performance, profitability, financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following nonIFRS measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable sales growth;\n- \u00b7 EBITA;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted (Adjusted EPS);\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA;\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow;\n- \u00b7 Net debt : group equity ratio; and\n- \u00b7 Organic Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\n\nNon-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings under IFRS and not all companies calculate non-IFRS measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to measures used by other companies that have the same or similar names. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the non-IFRS measures contained in this Annual Report and they should not be considered as substitutes for sales, net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other financial measures computed in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThis chapter contains the definitions of the non-IFRS measures used in this Annual Report as well as reconciliations from the most directly comparable IFRS measures. The non-IFRS measures discussed in this Annual Report are cross referenced to this chapter. These non-IFRS measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to equivalent IFRS measures and should be used in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS, but measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of Philips' business and operations and, accordingly, they have not been audited or reviewed by Philips' external auditors.\n\nAdditionally, Philips provides forward-looking targets for comparable sales growth, adjusted EBITA margin improvement, free cash flow and organic ROIC, which are non-IFRS financial measures. Philips has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of these targets to the most directly comparable IFRS measures because certain information needed to reconcile these non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures are dependent on specific items or impacts which are not yet determined, are subject to uncertainty and variability in timing and amount due to their nature, are outside of Philips' control, or cannot be predicted, including items and impacts such as currency exchange rates, acquisitions and disposals, legal and tax gains and losses and pension settlements, charges and costs such as impairments, restructuring and acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and net capital expenditures. Accordingly, reconciliations of these non-IFRS forward looking financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Such unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## 12.3 Other information\n\n## Comparable sales growth\n\nComparable sales growth represents the period-on-period growth in sales excluding the effects of currency movements and changes in consolidation. As indicated in Significant accounting policies, starting on page 128, foreign currency sales and costs are translated into Philips' presentation currency, the euro, at the exchange rates prevailing at the respective transaction dates. As a result of significant foreign currency sales and currency movements during the periods presented, the effects of translating foreign currency sales amounts into euros could have a material impact on the comparability of sales between periods. Therefore, these impacts are excluded when presenting comparable sales in euros by translating the foreign currency sales of the previous period and the current period into euros at the same average exchange rates. In addition, the years presented were affected by a number of acquisitions and divestments, as a result of which various activities were consolidated or deconsolidated. The effect of consolidation changes has also been excluded in arriving at the comparable sales. For the purpose of calculating comparable sales, when a previously consolidated entity is sold or control is lost, relevant sales for that entity of the corresponding prior year period are excluded. Similarly, when an entity is acquired and consolidated, relevant sales for that entity of the current year period are excluded.\n\nComparable sales growth is presented for the Philips Group, operating segments and geographic clusters. Philips' believes that the presentation of comparable sales growth is meaningful for investors to evaluate the performance of Philips' business activities over time. Comparable sales growth may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, because comparable sales growth figures are not adjusted for other effects, such as increases or decreases in prices or quantity/volume. In addition, interaction effects between currency movements and changes in consolidation are not taken into account.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Sales growth composition per segment in %\n\n|                       | nominal growth   | consolidation changes   | currency effects   | comparable growth   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| 2020 versus 2019      |                  |                         |                    |                     |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | (3.7)            | (1.0)                   | 2.3                | (2.3)               |\n| Connected Care        | 19.1             | 0.7                     | 2.3                | 22.0                |\n| Personal Health       | (7.6)            | 0.0                     | 3.5                | (4.2)               |\n| Philips Group         | 0.3              | (0.4)                   | 2.6                | 2.5                 |\n| 2019 versus 2018      |                  |                         |                    |                     |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 9.8              | (1.2)                   | (3.2)              | 5.5                 |\n| Connected Care        | 7.7              | (0.4)                   | (4.2)              | 3.1                 |\n| Personal Health       | 6.0              | 0.2                     | (1.2)              | 5.0                 |\n| Philips Group         | 7.5              | (0.3)                   | (2.8)              | 4.5                 |\n| 2018 versus 2017      |                  |                         |                    |                     |\n| Diagnosis & Treatment | 4.9              | (2.4)                   | 4.1                | 6.6                 |\n| Connected Care        | 0.2              | (1.6)                   | 4.1                | 2.7                 |\n| Personal Health       | (2.8)            | 0.6                     | 4.6                | 2.3                 |\n| Philips Group         | 1.9              | (1.4)                   | 4.2                | 4.7                 |",

EBITA represents Income from operations excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill. Adjusted EBITA represents EBITA excluding gains or losses from restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other items.\n\nRestructuring costs are defined as the estimated costs of initiated reorganizations, the most significant of which have been approved by the Executive Committee, and which generally involve the realignment of certain parts of the industrial and commercial organization.\n\nAcquisition-related charges are defined as costs that are directly triggered by the acquisition of a company, such as transaction costs, purchase accounting related costs and integration-related expenses.\n\n## 12.3 Other information\n\nOther items are defined as any individual item with an income statement impact (loss or gain) that is deemed by management to be both significant and incidental to normal business activity. Other items may extend over several quarters and are not limited to the same financial year.\n\nPhilips considers the use of Adjusted EBITA appropriate as Philips uses it as a measure of segment performance and as one of its strategic drivers to increase profitability through re-allocation of its resources towards opportunities offering more consistent and higher returns. This is done with the aim of making the underlying performance of the businesses more transparent.\n\nEBITA excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets (and impairment of goodwill), which primarily relates to brand names, customer relationships and technology, as Philips believes that such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency, are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and do not factor into its decisions on allocation of its resources across segments. Although we exclude amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets from our Adjusted EBITA measure, Philips believes that it is important for investors to understand that these acquired intangible assets contribute to revenue generation.\n\nPhilips believes Adjusted EBITA is useful to evaluate financial performance on a comparable basis over time by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisitionrelated charges and other incidental items which are not directly related to the operational performance of Philips Group or its segments.\n\nAdjusted EBITA may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items, which may be significant and have a significant effect on Philips' net income.\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin refers to Adjusted EBITA divided by sales expressed as a percentage.\n\nAdjusted EBITA is not a recognized measure of financial performance under IFRS. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, Net income, for the years indicated is included in the following table. Net income is not allocated to segments as certain income and expense line items are monitored on a centralized basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group level only.",

Shareholders refers to shareholders of Koninklijke Philips N.V.\n\nRestructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other items are all defined in the Adjusted EBITA section above.\n\nNet finance expenses are defined as either the financial income or expense component of an individual item already identified to be excluded as part of the Adjusted income from continuing operations, fair value movements of equity investments in limited life funds recognized at fair value through profit or loss or a financial income or expense component with an income statement impact (gain or loss) that is deemed by management to be both significant and incidental to normal business activity.\n\nThe Tax impact of the adjusted items is calculated using the Weighted Average Statutory Tax Rate plus any recurring tax costs or benefits.\n\nIn 2020, Philips revised the definition of net finance expenses used in the calculation of Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders, to exclude fair value movements of limited life fund investments recognized at fair value through profit and loss. This change leads to more relevant information as the fair value movements are not indicative of Philips' performance. In addition, the fair value movements do not represent cash items. Philips believes making this change is helpful for investors to evaluate Philips' performance. Limited life fund investments are presented under Other noncurrent financial assets and classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (refer to note Other financial assets, starting on page 168), and related fair value movements are presented in financial income and expense (refer to note Financial income and expenses, starting on page 154). Fair value movements of equity investments in limited life funds in 2020 were EUR 131 million. Fair value movements of equity investments in limited life funds in 2019 were EUR 1 million.\n\nPhilips considers the use of Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders appropriate as Philips uses it as the basis for the Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders per common share (in EUR) - diluted, a non-IFRS measure.\n\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes certain items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items, which may be significant and have a significant effect on Philips' net income. Net income, for the years indicated is included in the following table. Net income is not allocated",

Philips considers Adjusted EBITDA useful when comparing its performance to other companies in the HealthTech industry. However, Adjusted EBITDA may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool because of the range of items excluded and their significance in a given reporting",

Our management compensates for the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement IFRS results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than IFRS results alone. In addition to the limitations noted above, Adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods. This is because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events. Also, the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods and may not be indicative of future results. A reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below. Net income, for the years indicated is included in the following table.

Net capital expenditures are comprised of the purchase of intangible assets, expenditures on development assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.\n\nPhilips discloses free cash flow as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure, as Philips believes it is a meaningful measure to evaluate the performance of its business activities over time. Philips understands that free cash flow is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing its performance. Philips also believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash generated by the Philips operations after deducting cash outflows for purchases of intangible assets, capitalization of product development, expenditures on development assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Therefore, the measure gives an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of the business. In addition, because free cash flow is not impacted by purchases or sales of businesses and investments, it is generally less volatile than the total of net cash provided by (used for) operating activities and net cash provided by (used for) investing activities.\n\nFree cash flow may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as free cash flow is not a measure of cash generated by operations available exclusively for discretionary expenditures and Philips requires funds in addition to those required for capital expenditures for a wide variety of non-discretionary\n\nexpenditures, such as payments on outstanding debt, dividend payments or other investing and financing activities. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect cash payments that may be required in future for costs already incurred, such as restructuring costs.\n\nPhilips adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. As a result, Philips calculation of Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes the impact of IFRS 16.

        "page_content": "## 12.3 Other information\n\n## Net debt : group equity ratio\n\nNet debt : group equity ratio is presented to express the financial strength of Philips. Net debt is defined as the sum of long- and short-term debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Group equity is defined as the sum of shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests. This measure is used by Philips Treasury management and investment analysts to evaluate financial strength and funding requirements. This measure may be subject to limitations because cash and cash equivalents are used for various purposes, not only debt repayment. The net debt calculation deducts all cash and cash equivalents whereas these items are not necessarily available exclusively for debt repayment at any given time.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Composition of net debt to group equity in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                               | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Long-term debt                | 3,427  | 4,939  | 5,705  |\n| Short-term debt               | 1,394  | 508    | 1,229  |\n| Total debt                    | 4,821  | 5,447  | 6,934  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 1,688  | 1,425  | 3,226  |\n| Net debt                      | 3,132  | 4,022  | 3,708  |\n| Shareholders' equity          | 12,088 | 12,597 | 11,870 |\n| Non-controlling interests     | 29     | 28     | 31     |\n| Group equity                  | 12,117 | 12,625 | 11,901 |\n| Net debt : group equity ratio | 21:79  | 24:76  | 24:76  |\n\n## Organic Return on Invested Capital\n\nOrganic Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is defined as organic return which includes income from operations for the year excluding the impact of: Income or Loss from operations of businesses acquired in the five year period prior to the measurement date; certain tax gains and losses determined by management to be material in nature and require separate disclosure and; certain other items; and tax effects of the other adjustments (calculated at group effective tax rate) divided by average of the Net operating capital at the end of each of the five quarters ending on the relevant measurement date excluding the average net operating capital at the end of each of the five quarters ending on the relevant measurement date of the businesses acquired in the five year period prior to the measurement date, expressed as a percentage.\n\nNet operating capital is defined as tangible fixed assets, intangible fixed assets, including goodwill, inventories and receivable balances, minus payable balances and provisions, all as further defined below. Net operating capital is also adjusted to exclude assets and liabilities of businesses acquired in the five year period prior to the relevant measurement date. Organic ROIC is calculated after taxes.\n\nOther items are defined as material in nature and require separate disclosure and have the same nature as the items excluded from Adjusted EBITA. In the years 2019-2020 these other items included legal provisions, pension settlements and results of divestments. Refer to Net income, Income from operations (EBIT) and Adjusted EBITA within Results of operations, starting on page 27 section of Financial performance, starting on page 26.\n\nThe term Organic Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used by management to evaluate Philips' efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments and how well the company uses capital to generate returns. Philips believes that Organic ROIC provides useful information to investors because it excludes the impact of recently acquired businesses, giving a more accurate representation of how the Philips Business System is leveraged to drive operational excellence and removes irregularity caused by various operating models of recently acquired businesses. Philips also believes that excluding certain items determined by management to be material in nature and requiring separate disclosure enhances comparability across several periods. Organic ROIC may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes Income or Loss from operations of acquired businesses and tax gains and losses and certain other items, which may have a significant effect on ROIC. Organic ROIC is not a recognized measure of financial performance under IFRS.\n\nThe most comparable IFRS measure to Organic ROIC is Return on total assets, calculated as Income from operations for the year divided by total assets as of the end of the year. Return on total assets as of the balance sheet date for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2020 is included in the table below.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Return on total assets in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                            | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income from operations     | 1,719  | 1,644  | 1,542  |\n| Total assets               | 26,019 | 27,016 | 27,713 |\n| Return on total assets (%) | 6.6%   | 6.1%   | 5.6%   |\n\nThe reconciliation of Average Net operating capital and the reconciliation of Net income to Organic ROIC for the years ended 31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020 are included in the following tables. Philips adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. As a result, Philips calculation of Organic ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes the impact of IFRS 16. Organic ROIC calculations for the year ended December 31, 2018 have not been restated for this impact.",

We use Lives Improved as a measurement of our societal impact. We define Lives Improved as the number of individuals who have interacted with Philips products that contribute to the social or ecological dimension over the lifetime of a product. We calculate Lives Improved as the number of individual interactions for each product sold (based on market intelligence and statistical data) and multiply by the number of those products delivered in a year (eliminating double counting for multiple different product touches per individual). See Improving people's lives, starting on page 54 for more information on Lives Improved.\n\n## Operational Carbon Footprint\n\nAs a responsible company, we aim to minimize our environmental impact and we use the Operational Carbon Footprint as one of the measurements of our impact. We define Operational Carbon Footprint as the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an organization, event, product or person; expressed in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent. We calculate our Operational Carbon Footprint on a half-year basis and include industrial sites (manufacturing and assembly sites), nonindustrial sites (offices, warehouses, IT centers and R&D facilities), business travel (lease and rental cars and airplane travel) and logistics (air, sea and road transport) See Sustainable Operations, starting on page 50 for more information on our Operational Carbon Footprint.\n\n## Circular Revenues\n\nAs a company committed to the transition to a circular economy, we aim to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using those resources more effectively. We define Circular Revenues as revenues generated through products and solutions that meet specific Circular Economy requirements (including performance and access-based business models, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured products and systems, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured components, upgrades or refurbishment on site or remote, and products with a recycled plastics content of >25% post-consumer recycled plastics or >30% post-industrial/postconsumer recycled plastics by total weight of eligible plastics). We calculate Circular Revenues as annual revenues attributable to products and solutions that meet the Circular Economy requirements.",

        "page_content": "## 12.4 Other information\n\n## Waste to Landfill\n\nAt Philips, as a responsible company, we strive to reduce our environmental impact. We define Waste to Landfill as total waste that is delivered for landfill and exclude one-time-only waste and waste delivered to landfill due to regulatory requirements. We calculate Waste to Landfill in kilotonnes per year. See Sustainable Operations, starting on page 50 for more information on Waste to Landfill.\n\n## Closing the Loop\n\nAt Philips, we are committed to offer a trade-in on all our professional medical equipment and to take care of responsible repurposing of such trade-in systems. We call this 'Closing the Loop'. We calculate Closing the Loop as Process Adherence (%) * Reclaim (%). Process adherence (%) is defined as the % of won Replacement Philips deals which are associated with a trade in request in our CRM system. Reclaim (%) is defined as the % of won Replacement Philips deals with a customer accepted trade in request in our CRM system and a repurposing strategy that fulfills our reclaim requirements.\n\nPhilips believes that the five other key performance indicators described above (Lives Improved, Operational Carbon Footprint, Circular Revenues, Waste to Landfill and Closing the Loop) provide important information to investors and are important to understanding the long-term performance and prospects of the business. In addition, these other key performance indicators are also used for management compensation purposes. Members of the Board of Management are eligible for grants of performance shares under the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan, and the vesting of the performance shares is subject to performance over a period of 3 years and based on certain criteria, including a 10% weighting for Sustainability Objectives, which Philips defines as the five other key performance indicators described above: Lives Improved, Carbon Footprint, Circular Revenues, Waste to Landfill and Closing the Loop. Philips believes that including these other key performance indicators in our remuneration policy encourages management to act responsibly and sustainably, supporting the company's overall performance and enhancing the long-term value of the company. See Remuneration of the Board of Management in 2020, starting on page 98 for more information on the Philips' Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan.\n\n## Comparable order intake\n\nComparable order intake represents the period-on-period growth, expressed as a percentage, in order intake excluding the effects of currency movements and changes in consolidation. Comparable order intake is reported for equipment and software in the Diagnoses & Treatment and Connected Care businesses, and is defined as the total contractually committed value of equipment and software to be delivered within a specified timeframe, and is an approximation of expected future revenue growth in the respective businesses. Comparable order intake does\n\nnot derive from the financial statements and a quantitative reconciliation is thus not provided.\n\nEffective 2020, Philips has simplified its order intake policy by aligning horizons for all modalities to 18 months to revenue, compared to previously used delivery horizons of 6 months for Ultrasound, 12 months for Connected Care and 15 months for Diagnosis & Treatment. At the time, Philips has aligned order intake for software contracts to the same 18 months to revenue horizon, meaning that only the next 18 months conversion to revenue under the contract is recognized, compared to the full contract values recognized previously. This change eliminates major variances in order intake growth and better reflects expected revenue in the short term from order intake booked in the reporting period. Prior-year comparable order intake amounts have been restated accordingly. This realignment has not resulted in any material additional order intake recognition.\n\nPhilips uses comparable order intake as an indicator of business activity and performance. Comparable order intake is not an alternative to revenue and may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool due to differences in amount and timing between booking orders and revenue recognition. Due to divergence in practice, other companies may calculate this or a similar measure (such as order backlog) differently and therefore comparisons between companies may be complicated.",

Examples of forwardlooking statements include statements made about our strategy, estimates of sales growth, future Adjusted EBITA *) , future restructuring and acquisition-related charges and other costs, future developments in Philips' organic business and the completion of acquisitions and divestments. Forward-looking statements can be identified generally as those containing words such as 'anticipates', 'assumes', 'believes', 'estimates', 'expects', 'should', 'will', 'will likely result', 'forecast', 'outlook', 'projects', 'may' or similar expressions. By their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances and there are many factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements.\n\nThese factors include but are not limited to: changes in industry or market circumstances; economic and political developments; market and supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak; Philips' increasing focus on health technology; the realization of Philips' growth ambitions and results in growth geographies; successful completion of divestments such as the divestment of our Domestic Appliances businesses; lack of control over certain joint ventures; integration of acquisitions; securing and maintaining Philips' intellectual property rights and unauthorized use of third-party intellectual property rights; compliance with quality standards, product safety laws and good manufacturing practices; exposure to IT security breaches, IT disruptions, system changes or failures; supply chain management; ability to create new products and solutions; attracting and retaining personnel; financial impacts from Brexit; compliance with regulatory regimes, including data privacy requirements; governmental investigations and legal proceedings with regard to possible anticompetitive market practices and other matters; business conduct rules and regulations; treasury risks and other financial risks; tax risks; costs of defined-benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans; reliability of internal controls, financial reporting and management process.\n\nAs a result, Philips' actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations set forth in such forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause future results to differ from such forward-looking statements, see also Risk management, starting on page 74.",

        "page_content": "## 12.7 Other information\n\n## Third-party market share data\n\nStatements regarding market share, contained in this document, including those regarding Philips' competitive position, are based on outside sources such as specialized research institutes, industry and dealer panels in combination with management estimates. Where full year information regarding 2020 is not yet available to Philips, market share statements may also be based on estimates and projections prepared by management and/or based on outside sources of information. Management's estimates of rankings are based on order intake or sales, depending on the business.\n\n## Use of non-IFRS information\n\nIn presenting and discussing the Philips Group's financial position, operating results and cash flows, management uses certain non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measure and should be used in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. A reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures is contained in this document. Reference is made in Reconciliation of non-IFRS information, of this report.\n\n## Fair value information\n\nIn presenting the Philips Group's financial position, fair values are used for the measurement of various items in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid at the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values are not readily available, fair values are estimated using appropriate valuation models and unobservable inputs. Such fair value estimates require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are inherently uncertain and may therefore deviate from actual developments. Critical assumptions used are disclosed in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management's determination of fair values.\n\n## Statutory financial statements and management report\n\nThe chapters Group financial statements and Company financial statements contain the statutory financial statements of the Company. The introduction to the chapter Group financial statements sets out which parts of this Annual Report form the management report within the meaning of Section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n- Non-IFRS financial measure.

Of the commercialized chemical flame retardants, the brominated variety are most widely used.\n\n## CO2-equivalent\n\nCO2-equivalent or carbon dioxide equivalent is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gas, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), when measured over a specified timescale (generally 100 years).\n\n## Circular economy\n\nA circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using those resources more effectively. By definition it is a driver for innovation in the areas of material, component and product reuse, as well as new business models such as solutions and services. In a Circular Economy, the more effective use of materials makes it possible to create more value, both by cost savings and by developing new markets or growing existing ones.\n\n## Circular Revenues\n\nCircular Revenues are defined by revenues generated through products and solutions that meet specific Circular Economy requirements. These include performance and access-based business models, refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured products and systems, refurbished, reconditioned and",

All references to dividend yield are as of December 31 of the previous year.\n\n## Employee Engagement Index (EEI)\n\nThe Employee Engagement Index (EEI) is the single measure of the overall level of employee engagement at Philips. It is a combination of perceptions and attitudes related to employee satisfaction, commitment and advocacy.\n\n## Energy-using Products (EuP)\n\nAn energy-using product is a product that uses, generates, transfers or measures energy (electricity, gas, fossil fuel). Examples include boilers, computers, televisions, transformers, industrial fans and industrial furnaces.\n\n## Full-time equivalent employee (FTE)\n\nFull-time equivalent is a way to measure a worker's involvement in a project. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to a full-time worker, while an FTE of 0.5 signals that the worker works half-time.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a network-based organization that pioneered the world's most widely used sustainability reporting framework. GRI is committed to the framework's continuous improvement and application worldwide. GRI's core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance.\n\n## Green Innovation\n\nGreen Innovation comprises all R&D activities directly contributing to the intended development of Green Products or Green Technologies. Innovation projects are characterized as Green based on the innovation brief; this designation is not revised during the project lifetime.\n\n## Green Products\n\nGreen Products offer a significant environmental improvement in one or more Green Focal Areas: Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight, Circularity, and Lifetime reliability. The life cycle approach is used to determine a product's overall environmental improvement. It calculates the environmental impact of a product over its total life cycle (raw materials, manufacturing, product use and disposal).\n\nGreen Products need to prove leadership in at least one Green Focal Area compared to industry standards, which is defined by a segment-specific peer group. This is done either by outperforming reference products (which can be a competitor or predecessor product in the particular product family) by at least 10%, by outperforming product-specific eco-requirements or by being awarded with a recognized eco-performance label. Because of different product portfolios, business segments have specified additional criteria for Green Products, including product specific minimum requirements where relevant.\n\n## Green Revenues\n\nGreen Revenues are generated through products and solutions which offer a significant environmental improvement in one or more of the Green Focal Areas: Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight, Circularity, and Lifetime reliability. Green Revenues are determined by classifying the environmental impact of the product or solution over its total life cycle. Philips uses Green Revenues as a measure of social and economic performance in addition to its environmental results. The use of this measure may be subject to limitations as it does not have a standardized meaning and similar measures could be determined differently by other companies.\n\nA product or solution that has been determined to contribute to Green Revenues will continue to do so until it is decommissioned.\n\n## Growth geographies\n\nGrowth geographies are the developing geographies comprising of Asia Pacific (excluding Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand), Latin America, Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East & Turkey (excluding Israel) and Africa.\n\n## Hazardous substances\n\nHazardous substances are generally defined as substances posing imminent and substantial danger to public health and welfare or the environment.\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT)\n\nIncome from operations as reported on the IFRS consolidated statement of income. The term EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) has the same meaning as Income from operations.\n\n## Income from continuing operations\n\nIncome from continuing operations as reported on the IFRS consolidated statement of income, which is net income from continuing operations, or net income excluding discontinued operations.\n\n## Large medical equipment\n\nMRI systems, CT scanners, NM systems, DXR equipment, and IGT Fixed systems.

After elimination of double counts multiple different product touches per individual are only counted once - the number of lives improved by our innovative solutions is calculated.\n\n## Long-term strategic partnership\n\nMulti-year contractual agreement that represents a partnership to enable longterm collaboration\n\n## Market/Market Group\n\nA Market consists of one or more countries operating as a single organization under a Market Leader. Our 17 Market organizations are organized in three market groups: North America, Greater China and International Markets.\n\n## Mature geographies\n\nMature geographies are the highly developed markets comprising of Western Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n## Net Promoter Score\n\nNet Promoter Score\u00ae, or NPS\u00ae, measures customer experience and predicts business growth. NPS is calculated by taking the answer to a key question on a 0-10 scale: How likely is it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or colleague?\n\nRespondents are grouped as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth.\n- \u00b7 Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.\n- \u00b7 Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage the brand and\n- impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.\n\nSubtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters yields the Net Promoter Score, which can range from a low of -100 (if every customer is a Detractor) to a high of 100 (if every customer is a Promoter).\n\n## Operational carbon footprint\n\nA carbon footprint is the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an organization, event, product or person; usually expressed in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent. Philips' operational carbon footprint is calculated on a half-year basis and includes industrial sites (manufacturing and assembly sites), nonindustrial sites (offices, warehouses, IT centers and R&D facilities), business travel (lease and rental cars and airplane travel) and logistics (air, sea and road transport).\n\n## Philips Lighting/Signify\n\nReferences to 'Signify' in this Annual Report relate to Philips' former Lighting segment (prior to deconsolidation as from the end of November 2017 and when reported as discontinued operations), Philips Lighting N.V. (before or after such deconsolidation) or Signify N.V. (after its renaming in May 2018), as the context requires.\n\n## Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)\n\nPolyvinyl chloride, better known as PVC or vinyl, is an inexpensive plastic so versatile it has become completely pervasive in modern society.\n\n## Quadruple Aim\n\nAt Philips, we make value-based care principles actionable by addressing the Quadruple Aim - better health outcomes, improved patient experience, improved staff experience, and lower cost of care.\n\n## REACH\n\nRegistration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is a European Union regulation that addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impact on both human health and the environment.\n\n## Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)\n\nThe Responsible Business Alliance (formerly known as The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC)) was established in 2004 to promote a common code of conduct for the electronics and information and communications technology (ICT) industry. EICC now includes more than 100 global companies and their suppliers.\n\n## Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS)\n\nThe RoHS Directive prohibits all new electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market in the European Economic Area from containing lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, poly-brominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), except in certain specific applications, in concentrations greater than the values decided by the European Commission. These values have been established as 0.01% by weight per homogeneous",

The broad goals are interrelated though each has its own targets. The SDGs cover a broad range of social and economic development issues. These include poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, water, sanitation, energy, environment and social justice.\n\n## Sustainable Innovation\n\nSustainable Innovation is the Research & Development spend related to the development of new generations of products and solutions that address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) or 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ). This includes all Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care innovation spend. In addition, innovation spend that contributes to Green Products and healthy living at Personal Health is included. Finally, innovation spend at Other that addresses the SDGs 3 and 1 is included.\n\n## VOC\n\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature. Their high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate or sublimate from the liquid or solid form of the compound and enter the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility.\n\n## Voluntary turnover\n\nVoluntary turnover covers all employees who resigned of their own volition.\n\n## Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)\n\nThe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) is the European Community directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment setting collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods. The directive imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the manufacturers of such equipment.\n\nThe reconciliation of the effective tax rate is based on the applicable statutory tax rate, which is a weighted average of all applicable jurisdictions. This weighted average statutory tax rate (WASTR) is the aggregation of the result before tax multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate without adjustment for losses, divided by the group result before tax.",

Next, in 2003, this was expanded with the launch of our first sustainability Annual Report, which provided details of our social and economic performance in addition to our environmental results. In 2008, we decided to publish an integrated financial, social and environmental report. This is our 13th annual integrated financial, social and environmental report. For more information, please refer to the company's website.\n\nRoyal Philips publishes its integrated Annual Report with the highest (reasonable) assurance level on the financial, social and environmental performance. With that overall reasonable assurance level, Philips is a frontrunner in our industry.\n\n## Tracking trends 13.1.1\n\nWe follow external trends continuously to determine the issues most relevant for our company and where we can make a positive contribution to society at large. In addition to our own research, we make use of a variety of sources, including the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), World Bank, World Economic Forum, IFRS, World Health Organization, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Our work also involves tracking topics of concern to governments, non-governmental organizations (NGO), regulatory bodies, academia, and following the resulting media coverage.\n\n## Stakeholders 13.1.2\n\nWe derive significant value from our diverse stakeholders across all our activities and engage with, listen to and learn from them. Working in partnerships is crucial to delivering on our purpose to improve people's health and well-being through meaningful innovation. We incorporate their feedback on specific areas of our business into our planning and actions. In addition, we participate in meetings and task forces as a member of organizations including the World Economic Forum, WBCSD, Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, European Round Table for Industry, Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) and the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals.\n\nFurthermore, we engage with the leading Dutch labor union (FNV) and a number of NGOs, including Enough, GoodElectronics, the Chinese Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, UNICEF, Amnesty International, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, as well as a variety of investors and analysts.\n\nOur sustainability e-mail account (philips.sustainability@philips.com) enables stakeholders to share their issues, comments and questions, also about this Annual Report, with the sustainability team. The following table provides an overview of the different stakeholder groups, examples of those stakeholders and the topics discussed, used for our materiality analysis.\n\n## Stakeholder overview (non-exhaustive)\n\n|                                   | Examples   | Examples                                                               | Processes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees                         | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7      | European Works Council Local Works Councils Individual employees       | Regular meetings, quarterly Employee Survey, employee development process, quarterly update webinars.

        "page_content": "## 13.1.4 Sustainability statements\n\nThis integrated annual report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option. A detailed overview of the GRI Comprehensive indicators can be found in the GRI content index on our sustainability website. Next, we developed additional company-specific indicators and started to measure the impact we are having on society. The information on definition, scope and measurement can be found in this chapter.\n\nWe signed up to the United Nations Global Compact in March 2007 to advance 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anticorruption. Our General Business Principles, Human Rights, Sustainability and Environmental Policies, and our Supplier Sustainability Declaration are the cornerstones that enable us to live up to the standards set by the Global Compact. This is closely monitored and reported, as illustrated throughout this report, which is also our annual Communication on Progress (COP) submitted to the UN Global Compact Office.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in January 2017 Philips signed the Compact for Responsive and Responsible Leadership. The Compact is an initiative to promote and align the long-term sustainability of corporations and the long-term goals of society, with an inclusive approach for all stakeholders. In this Annual Report we also included the WEF's International Business Council new ESG framework.\n\nWe use this report to communicate on our progress towards the relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ), SDG 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and SDG 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ). Please refer to Stakeholder engagement, starting on page 270 for more details.\n\n## Material topics and our focus 13.1.4\n\nWe identify the environmental, social, and governance topics which have the greatest impact on our business and the greatest level of concern to stakeholders along our value chain. Assessing these topics enables us to prioritize and focus upon the most material topics and effectively address these in our policies and programs.\n\nMateriality matrix 2020 Philips Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur materiality assessment is based on an ongoing trend analysis, media search, and stakeholder input. In 2020, we solicited input from a diverse group of external and internal stakeholders, including investors, NGOs, customers, suppliers, peer companies, academia, and senior management in Philips. Similar to 2019, we used an evidence-based approach to materiality analysis powered by Datamaran. By applying Datamaran's automated sifting and analysis of millions of data points from publicly available sources, including, corporate reports, mandatory regulations and voluntary initiatives, as well as news and social media, we identified a list of topics that are material to our business. With this data-driven approach to materiality analysis we have incorporated a wider range of data and stakeholders than was ever possible before and managed to get an evidencebased perspective into regulatory, strategic and reputational risks and opportunities. Expectedly, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Public health risks emerged as a new material topic. The most significant increases compared to 2019 on the external view are Fair and inclusive workplace and Employees wellbeing, health & safety. The internal view saw a significant increase in importance on Fair and inclusive workplace, Big data and privacy, and Talent and development .",

As a result of impact assessments of our value chain we have identified the material topics, determined their relative impact in the value chain (supply chain, our own operations, and use phase of our products) and reported for each topic on the relevant parts of the value chain. More details are provided in the relevant sections in the Sustainability Statements.\n\nThe consolidated selected financial information in this Sustainability statements section has been derived from the Group Financial Statements, which are based on IFRS.\n\n## Comparability and completeness 13.1.7\n\nWe used expert opinions and estimates for some parts of the Key Performance Indicator calculations. There is therefore an inherent uncertainty in our calculations, e.g. Lives Improved, Environmental Profit and Loss account and\n\nSocial Impact calculations. The figures reported are Philips' best estimate. As our insight increases, we may enhance the methodology in the future.\n\nIn 2020, Philips has made changes to the EP&L use case scenario, the energy mix of the use phase of its products and added the full Sleep & Respiratory Care portfolio to the EP&L scope. For comparability reasons, we have also applied these changes to the 2019 EP&L and refined the EP&L impact based on 2019 sales volumes. For more information we refer to Environmental performance, starting on page 46 and our methodology document.\n\nIn 2019, Philips re-aligned its 'Lives Improved' target with the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda following the completion of its portfolio transformation. Philips targets an ambitious, average annual Lives Improved growth rate of around 6% for the 2019 - 2030 period.\n\nIn 2020 the emission factor set for consumed electricity was updated to the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2019 v1.01 publications. For our market-based scope 2 calculations in Europe and the US, Reliable Disclosure (RE-DISS) and AIB European Residual Mixes 2018 Version 1.1 and US Environmental Protection Agency eGRID - 2016 (Released Feb 2018) v1.2 residual-mix emission factors were used as prescribed in the Scope 2 Guidance | Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nThe emissions of substances data is based on measurements and estimates at manufacturing site level. The figures reported are Philips' best estimate.\n\nThe integration of newly acquired activities is scheduled according to a defined integration timetable (in principle, the first full reporting year after the year of acquisition) and subject to the integration agenda. Data for activities that are divested during the reporting year are not included in full-year reporting. Environmental data are reported for manufacturing sites with more than 50 industrial employees.\n\n## Scope 13.1.8\n\n## Lives improved and materials\n\nThe Key Performance Indicators on 'lives improved' and 'materials' and the scope are defined in the respective methodology documents that can be found in Methodology for calculating Lives Improved. We used opinions from Philips experts and estimates for some parts of the Lives Improved calculations. Philips has made strong commitments to enabling healthy living and well-being for all. To track our impact, Philips identifies countries where the need for access to healthcare is highest. This is determined by four selected health indicators, as provided by United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, which focuses on health and well-being. The specific methodology for how we determine an underserved health community can be found in the same document.",

        "page_content": "## Health and safety\n\n## Operational carbon footprint\n\nHealth and safety data is reported by sites with over 50 FTEs (full-time equivalents) and is voluntary for smaller locations. Health and safety data are reported and validated each month via an online centralized IT tool. The Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate is defined as a KPI for work-related cases where the injured employee is unable to work one or more days, or had medical treatment or sustained an industrial illness. We also provide the Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC) rate, which measures work-related injuries and illnesses that predominantly occur in manufacturing operations and Field Services Organizations where the incident leads to at least one lost workday. Fatalities are reported for staff, contractors and visitors. The TRC and LWIC KPIs refer to all reported cases.\n\n## General Business Principles\n\nAlleged GBP violations are registered in our web-based reporting and validation tool.\n\n## Environmental data\n\nAll environmental data from manufacturing operations, except process chemicals, are reported on a monthly basis in our sustainability reporting and validation tool, according to company guidelines that include definitions, procedures and calculation methods. Process chemicals are reported on a half-yearly basis.\n\nInternal validation processes have been implemented and peer audits performed to ensure consistent data quality and to assess the robustness of data reporting systems.\n\nThese environmental data from manufacturing are tracked and reported to measure progress against our Sustainable Operations targets.\n\nA manufacturing site is classified as \"Zero Waste to Landfill\" if less than or equal to 0.5% of the total regular waste reported by the site is sent directly to landfill via an external contractor. This excludes waste that is landfilled due to a regulatory requirement and One-time waste. A site needs to meet these requirements at least two consecutive reporting periods.\n\nReporting on ISO 14001 certification is based on manufacturing units reporting in the sustainability reporting system.\n\n## Environmental Profit & Loss account\n\nThe Philips Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account measures our environmental impact on society at large. The EP&L account is based on Life Cycle Analysis methodology in which the environmental impacts are expressed in monetary terms using specific conversion factors. For more information we refer to our methodology report .\n\nPhilips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the locationbased method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total operational carbon footprint.\n\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 - direct CO2e emissions - is reported on in full, with details of direct emissions from our industrial and non-industrial sites. Emissions from industrial sites, which consist of direct emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion and use of refrigerants on our sites, are reported in the sustainability reporting system. Energy use and CO2e emissions from non-industrial sites are based on actual data where available. If this is not the case, they are estimated based on average energy usage per square meter, taking the geographical location and building type of the site into account.\n- \u00b7 Scope 2 - indirect CO2e emissions - is reported on in full, with details of indirect emissions from our industrial and non-industrial sites. CO2e emissions resulting from purchased electricity, steam, heat and other indirect sources are reported in the sustainability reporting system. The indirect emissions of sites not yet reporting are calculated in the same manner as described in Scope 1.\n- \u00b7 The location-based method of scope 2 reporting reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using mostly grid-average emission factor data). For this method our emission factors derive from the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2019 and are based on grid averages.\n- \u00b7 The market-based method of scope 2 reporting allows use of an emission factor that is specific to the energy purchased. The emissions intensity of consumed energy can differ according to the contractual instruments used. For example, so-called 'green electricity contracts' guarantee the purchaser will be supplied with electricity from renewable sources, which typically lowers emissions per energy unit generated. In the market-based method Philips will account for renewable electricity with an emission factor of 0 grams CO2e per kWh. All renewable electricity claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy market where the electricity-consuming operations are located, and is tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of Philips. All certificates were obtained through Green-e certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in the United States, European Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) of the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) and i-RECs for our ASEAN operations. To ensure additionality, all certificates were generated in 2020 in the country of consumption and are retired on behalf Royal Philips. To quantify our emissions we have used the residual mix emission factors derived from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) and Green-e where",

        "page_content": "- available. Where location specific residual mix factors were missing, the grid-average emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used.\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 - other CO2e emissions related to activities not owned or controlled by Royal Philips - is reported on for our business travel and distribution activities.\n\nThe Philips operational carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and 3) is calculated on a quarterly basis and includes the emissions from our:\n\n- \u00b7 industrial sites - manufacturing and assembly sites\n- \u00b7 non-industrial sites - offices, warehouses, IT centers and R&D facilities\n- \u00b7 business travel - lease and rental cars and airplane travel\n- \u00b7 logistics - air, ocean, parcel and road transport\n\nAll emission factors used to transform input data (for example, amount of tonnekilometers transported) into CO2 emissions have been updated to the DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) 2019 and the IEA emission factor set 2019. The total CO2 emission resulting from these calculations serves as input for scope 1, 2 and 3.\n\nCommuting by our employees, upstream distribution (before suppliers ship to us), outsourced activities and emissions resulting from product use by our customers are not included in our operational carbon footprint. The calculations for business travel by lease car are based on actual fuel usage, and for travel by rental car the emissions are based on the actual mileage. Taxis and chauffeur-driven cars used for business travel are not included in the calculations. Emissions from business travel by airplane are calculated based on mileage flown and emission factors from DEFRA 2019, distinguishing between short, medium and long-haul flights. Furthermore, emissions from air freight for distribution are calculated based on the amount of tonne-kilometers transported between airports (distinguishing between short, medium and long-haul flights), including an estimate (based on actual data of the lanes with the largest volumes) for trucking from sites and distribution centers to airports and vice versa. Express shipments are generally a mix of road and air transport, depending on the distance.\n\nIt is therefore assumed that shipments across less than 500 km are transported by road and the rest by air (those emissions by air are calculated in the same way as air freight). For sea transport, only data on transported volume were available, so an estimate had to be made about the average weight of a container. Transportation to and from ports is not registered. This fore and aft part of sea transport was estimated to be around 3% of the total distance (based on actual data of the lanes with the largest volumes), consisting of a mix of modalities, and was added to the total emissions accordingly. CO2e emissions from road transport were also calculated based on tonne-kilometers. Return travel of vehicles is not included in the data for ocean and road distribution.\n\n## Employee Engagement Index (EEI)\n\nThe Employee Engagement Index (EEI) is the single measure of the overall level of employee engagement at Philips. It is a combination of perceptions and attitudes related to employee satisfaction, commitment and advocacy.\n\nThe reported figures are based on the Employee Survey. The total score of the employee engagement is an average of the quarterly results of the survey. The results are calculated by taking the average of the answered questions of the surveys.\n\n## Sustainability governance 13.1.9\n\nSustainability is strongly embedded in our core business processes, like innovation (EcoDesign), sourcing (Supplier Sustainability Program), manufacturing (Sustainable Operations), logistics (Green Logistics) and projects like the Circular Economy initiative.\n\nIn Royal Philips, the Sustainability Board is the highest governing sustainability body and is chaired by the Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer, who is a member of the Executive Committee. Four other Executive Committee members, our Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Legal Officer, our Chief Human Resources Officer and our Chief Business Leader Precision Diagnosis, sit on the Sustainability Board together with segment and functional executives. The Sustainability Board convenes four times per year, defines Philips' sustainability strategy, programs and policies, monitors progress and takes corrective action where needed.\n\nProgress on Sustainability is communicated internally and externally (www.results.philips.com) on a quarterly basis and at least annually in the Executive Committee and Supervisory Board.\n\n## External assurance 13.1.10\n\nEY has provided reasonable assurance on whether the information in Sustainability statements, starting on page 244 and Environmental, Social and Governance, starting on page 43, except for sections Remuneration policy, starting on page 61 and Risk management approach , starting on page 61 and presents fairly, in all material respects, the sustainability performance in accordance with the reporting criteria.

For a full understanding of each of these indicators, see the specific financial statements and notes in this report.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Distribution of direct economic benefits in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Suppliers: goods and services                     | 9,568  | 10,607 | 10,754 |\n| Employees: salaries and wages                     | 4,849  | 5,251  | 5,372  |\n| Shareholders: distribution from retained earnings | 738    | 775    | 758    |\n| Government: corporate income taxes                | 193    | 337    | 284    |\n| Capital providers: net interest                   | 157    | 169    | 159    |\n\nTotal purchased goods and services as included in cost of sales amounted to EUR 10.8 billion, representing 55% of total revenues of the Philips Group. Of this amount, approximately 53% was spent with global suppliers, the remainder with local suppliers.\n\nIn 2020, salaries and wages totaled EUR 5.4 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2019, mainly driven by the growth in employees. See Income from operations, starting on page 150 for more information.\n\nPhilips' shareholders were given EUR 758 million including costs in the form of a dividend.\n\nIncome taxes amounted to EUR 284 million. The effective income tax rate in 2020 was 19.0%, compared to 22.1% in 2019, mainly due to one-off non-cash benefits from a decrease in tax rate, and higher non-taxable results from participations, partly offset by lower non-cash benefits from business integration compared to 2019. For 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be within the 24%-26% range, depending on the geographical mix of taxable income. For more information, see Income taxes, starting on page 155.\n\nPhilips supports global initiatives of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and UN (United Nations) to promote tax transparency and responsible tax management, taking into account the interests of various stakeholders, such as governments, shareholders, customers and the communities in which Philips operates. For more information, please refer to Our approach to taxes.\n\nIn 2020, Philips further reinforced its commitments as a purpose-driven company with the announcement of an enhanced and fully integrated approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably. This section provides additional information on (some of) the environmental performance parameters reported in Environmental performance, starting on page 46.\n\n## Circular Economy 13.3.1\n\nThe transition from a linear to a circular economy is essential to create a sustainable world that operates within the boundary conditions of our one planet. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using these resources more effectively.\n\n## Circular Economy program\n\nThe Circular Economy program at Philips ran for the eighth year in 2020. It consists of seven strategic pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Close the loop with current products through take-back, refurbishment, and recycling\n- \u00b7 Further circular practices across Philips sites, including zero waste to landfill policy\n- \u00b7 Circular design of products and business models\n- \u00b7 Technical competence building\n- \u00b7 Engaging and activating our employees\n- \u00b7 Driving change with (external) coalitions and supply chain\n- \u00b7 Embedding in the Philips Business System\n\nAt Philips, we see huge opportunities for businesses to provide greater value to customers through innovative service models, smart upgrade paths, software supporting resource optimization like tele-health offerings, product take-back and remanufacturing programs.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nPhilips leverages partnerships to help scale the circular economy globally. For example, our CEO is co-chair of the public-private Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE was launched in 2017 with the World Economic Forum in Davos and matured into in an independent organization hosted by the World Resource Institute in The Hague (2019). PACE's vision is to stimulate market transformation for a circular economy at scale and speed, regionally and globally. Its mission is to drive collaborative projects to implementation and scale learnings through global leadership.\n\nAs one of the key pillars under PACE, Philips has spearheaded the Capital Equipment Coalition, a group of front-running large equipment manufacturers, who all have committed to applying circular economy principles to preserve and recover value across the lifecycles of their respective products. Since its formation",

Learnings that may be useful to other capital equipment companies are published on a yearly basis during the World Economic Forum's Annual Meetings in Davos.\n\nThrough PACE and other collaborations, Philips is partnering with the other leading organizations to drive action at scale, such as The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Circle Economy, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and the Dutch Circular Transition Teams.\n\n## Closing the loop for professional medical equipment\n\nAt Philips, we are committed to offering a trade-in on all our professional medical equipment and to take care of responsible repurposing of such trade-in systems. We call this 'Closing the Loop'.\n\nWe are progressing on our ambition in phases. In 2018, Philips made a public commitment at the World Economic Forum to close the loop for Large Medical Equipment by the end of 2020. Large medical equipment refers to systems that are bolted to the floor or ceiling during operation. In 2020, Philips committed to expand these practices to all professional medical equipment by the end of 2025.\n\nIn 2020, Philips delivered on its commitment to close the loop for Large Medical Equipment:\n\n- \u00b7 After two years of month-over-month improvements, Philips succeeded by year-end 2020 in offering a trade-in for all Replacement Philips deals that we won around the globe for Large Medical Equipment\n- \u00b7 We had the process and infrastructure in place to responsibly repurpose all large medical trade-in systems that we won by year-end 2020\n\nThe visual illustrates the scope of Philips' achievement in closing the loop for professional medical equipment in 2020, and also identifies certain specific categories of equipment or situations that Philips has not (yet) covered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilips has made Closing the Loop part of its regular way of working by adopting a process standard in our process framework. In addition, we have created a business category, called Circular Equipment, to own this process on top of their responsibility for Diamond Select refurbished systems sales and spare parts recovery. We have integrated trade-in in our customer relationship management tooling and ensured that all Philips market organizations have a proven capability to initiate trade-in according to standard. We also include Closing the Loop in our top-down performance management processes, and progress is reviewed with all markets and businesses in scope.\n\nBesides process improvements, we have also made a number of infrastructural improvements. In 2020, Philips on-boarded 10 new countries to enable the return of systems to our refurbishing factories. And we have built a network of local partners for responsible material recycling of trade-in systems, which covers the countries where Philips has a commercial presence. We have also developed algorithms to predict the number of systems our customers will be replacing and to assess pro-actively what it will take to close the loop.",

Philips has teamed up with other companies in the Capital Equipment Coalition under PACE, to exchange best practices and to create momentum for change. Philips contributed to the creation of an IEC standard for good refurbishing practices to remove barriers to the use of refurbished medical devices.\n\nPhilips will continue its journey to close the loop for all professional medical equipment by 2025 and to address categories of equipment or situations that it has not yet covered.\n\n## Circular Revenues\n\nThe Circular Revenues percentage reflects our revenues from validated circular products and services as a percentage of total Philips revenues. The validation is based on the following Philips circularity requirements, which have been refined and complemented with software revenue in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we delivered on our ambition to generate a total of 15% of our revenues from circular propositions by 2020, which is double the rate of the 7% baseline achieved in 2015. we are pleased that we achieved this target with 15% Circular Revenues in 2020, and increased the target for 2025 to 25%.\n\n## Service revenue\n\n## Performance and Access-based models\n\nRevenues from hardware where ownership remains with Philips or an affiliated financing company, who will repurpose it in a responsible way across its lifetime.\n\n## Upgrades/lifetime extension on site or remote\n\nRevenues from hardware which is upgraded to better functionality and/or lifetime is extended, e.g. through refurbishment or software upgrade.\n\n## Hardware revenue\n\n## Refurbished/Remanufactured products/systems\n\nRevenues from selling refurbished or remanufactured products/systems with reused components >30% by total weight of product/system\n\n## Refurbished/Remanufactured parts/elements\n\nRevenues from recovered components that must be refurbished/remanufactured or tested/repaired in such a way that they are fit for use again and contain >30% re-used parts or materials by total component weight. The component can either be a stand-alone component or part of a new product/system.\n\n## Products with recycled plastics content\n\nRevenues from products with a recycled plastics content of >25% post-consumer recycled plastics or >30% post-industrial/post-consumer recycled plastics by total weight of eligible plastics.\n\n## Software revenue\n\n## Software optimizing resource use\n\nRevenues from software that enables one or more of the following: Remote interaction, Increased hardware utilization, Cloud computing, Data interoperability, Virtualization.\n\n## Analog to digital\n\nRevenues from products that have been redesigned to connect to generic hardware rather than dedicated hardware, e.g. a sensor that can connect directly to the mobile device of a hospital worker, instead of requiring a dedicated monitor.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nRevenues from our B2C products that contain a large amount of recycled plastics, such as coffeemakers and vacuum cleaners, irons and airfryers. The introduction of the Senseo Viva Caf\u00e9 Eco marked a big step forward as for the first time we introduced recycled plastics in high gloss visible housing parts.\n\n## Diagnosis & Treatment businesses\n\nOur Diamond Select offering of refurbished imaging systems for sale; system upgrades at customer premises to enhance performance and extend lifetime; repair and reuse of spare parts.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nA number of Philips businesses with rental, lease or subscription models, such as ventilators, Monitoring-as-a-Service, Tele-health solutions, and other sustainable software revenue.\n\n## Closing material loops on products and materials\n\nIn addition to tracking circular revenue, we are also working to achieve transparency on the material flows connected with the Philips businesses. In 2020, Philips put an estimated total of some 265,000 tonnes of products on the market. This assessment is based on sales data combined with product-specific weights. 85% of the total product weight was delivered through our B2C businesses in Personal Health and 15% through our B2B businesses (Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Connected Care businesses).",

        "page_content": "## 13.3.2 Sustainability statements\n\nWe can account for some 20,000 tonnes or approximately 8% of these products being collected, re-used or recycled globally. Europe has advanced collection systems in place. In these countries we have an average return rate of around 40-50%. National legislation is required to create the level playing field needed to set up efficient recycling systems beyond the EU. The main pathways and quantities for material re-use in 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Trade-in and return for resale as refurbished products and for spare parts harvesting (Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care): some 1,967 tonnes, a small decrease compared to 2,052 tonnes in 2019.\n- \u00b7 Collective collection and recycling schemes in accordance with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) collection schemes. These products are broken down into the main material fractions and provided to the market via our recycling partners\n- \u00b7 830 tonnes (estimated) from Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care field returns, following the WEEE category 8 classification, indicating a slight increase compared to the previous year (800 tonnes)\n- \u00b7 16,600 tonnes (estimated) from Personal Health, following the WEEE category 2 classification\n\nOn the demand side, the Personal Health businesses re-integrated significantly more recycled plastics in new products than the previous year, closing the material loop for some 1,930 tonnes (1,904 tonnes in 2019) of plastics due to regulatory headwinds on the import of recycled materials.\n\nMore information can be found on the Philips circular economy website.\n\n## Biodiversity 13.3.2\n\nPhilips recognizes the importance of healthy ecosystems and a rich biodiversity for our company, our employees, and society as a whole. By systematically reducing our environmental impact including our operations, supply chain and the use phase of our products, we actively help to protect the environment and biodiversity.\n\nPhilips aims to restore and enhance biodiversity at our sites and to actively promote ecosystem restoration activities through partnerships with, among others, NGOs, local communities, and governments. The Philips Environmental policy was updated in 2020 and progress has been made on biodiversity management, on sites (e.g. impact measurement) and on natural capital valuation. Our Best and Drachten sites in the Netherlands serve as role models on the topic of biodiversity. Improving biodiversity at our sites and thereby also improving the working environment, is a contributor to making Philips the 'best place to work', one of the ESG commitments Philips announced in 2020.\n\nAs can be derived from our Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account, the environmental impact of Philips' sites is limited as they are not very energyintensive, are now 100%-powered with electricity from renewable sources, do not emit large quantities of high-impact substance, and are not water-intensive.\n\nHaving become carbon-neutral in our operations by year-end 2020, and with our drive to send zero waste to landfill, focus on circular materials management, and enhance biodiversity, the environmental impact of our sites will be further optimized. The environmental impact of our supply chain, however, is significantly higher than our own impact. For this reason, we use the identified hotspots in our supply chain as input for our CDP Supply Chain program. More information on this program can be found in Supplier indicators, starting on page 263.\n\n## Sustainable Operations 13.3.3\n\nOur Sustainable Operations programs relate to improving the environmental performance of our manufacturing facilities and focus on most of the contributors to climate change, but also address water, recycling of waste and chemical substances.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Green operations\n\n|                                | baseline year 2015   | target 2020   | 2020 actual   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total CO2 from manufacturing   | 84 Ktonnes           | 0 Ktonnes     | 20 Ktonnes 1) |\n| Water                          | 978,500 m3           | 10% reduction | 777,476 m3    |\n| Zero waste to landfill         | 3.2 Ktonnes          | 0 Ktonnes     | 0.5 Ktonnes   |\n| Operational waste recycling    | 78%                  | 90%           | 90%           |\n| Hazardous substances emissions | 1,419 kilos          | 50% reduction | 576 kilos     |\n| VOC emissions                  | 169 tonnes           | 10% reduction | 83 tonnes     |\n\n1) Excluding carbon offsets. 0 Ktonnes including carbon offsets.\n\n## Energy use in manufacturing\n\nTotal energy usage in manufacturing amounted to 1,297 terajoules in 2020, of which Diagnosis & Treatment accounted for about 45% and Personal Health 38%. Energy consumption at Philips level decreased by 7% compared to 2019. Diagnosis & Treatment energy consumption increased by 6%, mainly due to increased production. Connected Care reported a 19% reduction due to organizational changes. Personal Health energy consumption decreased by 15%, mainly driven by changes in operational footprint and in production volumes at several sites.",

Our carbon footprint decreased by 24% compared to 2019, resulting in a total of 535 kilotonnes CO2.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent\n\n|                           |   2016 |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Logistics                 |    491 |    641 |    572 |    504 |    429 |\n| Business travel           |    158 |    145 |    149 |    153 |     71 |\n| Non-industrial operations |     77 |     40 |     40 |     27 |     15 |\n| Manufacturing             |     85 |     55 |     26 |     22 |     20 |\n\nThe 2020 results can be attributed to several factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting for 4% of our total footprint, total CO2 emissions from manufacturing decreased by 11.5% due to lower overall energy consumption due to COVID-19. All global manufacturing sites are already running on 100% renewable electricity as of 2019.\n- \u00b7 CO2 emissions from non-industrial operations (offices, warehouses, etc.), representing 3% of total emissions, decreased by 43% in 2020 due to a the achieved 100% renewable electricity target, lower heating- and electricity consumption due to COVID-19 and implemented energy efficiency projects.\n- \u00b7 Total CO2 emissions related to business travel, accounting for 13% of our carbon footprint, showed a huge drop of 54% compared to 2019, as a result of COVID-19. We recorded a drop of 78% in air travel-related emissions and a 11% decrease in our lease car-related emissions. The latter is also driven by our continuous electrification efforts of our fleet.\n- \u00b7 Overall CO2 emissions from logistics, representing 80% of the total, decreased by 15% compared to 2019. This was mainly driven by a decrease of 6% in air\n\nfreight as a result of flight restrictions and our air freight reduction program. Additionally, various measures have been introduced to drive down emissions from air freight, such as multi-modal shipments, a transition from air to ocean freight, a stricter air freight policy, and optimization of our warehouse locations. Our ocean freight emissions decreased as a result of improved data insights, allowing us to more accurately measure- and track ocean freight shipments, the shipments related weight and consequently the emissions related to these shipments. This has only been applied to the year 2020.\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Operational carbon footprint for logistics\n\n|                 |   2016 |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Air transport   |    361 |    491 |    393 |    328 |    310 |\n| Road transport  |     67 |     67 |     70 |     75 |     66 |\n| Ocean transport |     63 |     83 |    109 |    101 |     53 |\n| Philips Group   |    491 |    641 |    572 |    504 |    429 |\n\n## Carbon emissions in manufacturing\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from our manufacturing operations totaled 20 kilotonnes CO2-equivalent in 2020, 9% lower than in 2019.

This was driven by changes in our operations and product-mix in various regions. Diagnosis & Treatment CO2 emissions did not change, but Connected Care reported a 20% decrease. At Personal Health, CO2 emissions decreased by 13%.\n\nIn 2020, all manufacturing sites received 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. Our operations in the US were powered by wind energy since 2017. Additionally, our operations in the Netherlands received electricity from the Bouwdokken and Krammer wind farms since 2019, all helping to deliver on the ambition to become carbon-neutral in our operations by year-end 2020.\n\n## Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nOur 2020 integrated financial, social and environmental report aims to follow the recommendations of the TCFD. In 2020, we stepped-up our TCFD efforts, as we worked together with a multi-disciplinary team from Business Continuity Management, Enterprise Risk Management, Real Estate, Innovation and Strategy and Sustainability to assess the risks and opportunities for Philips related to climate change. Together with KPMG, we developed 2 scenarios - a 2 degrees and a 4 degrees global warming scenario - and assessed the impact on our supply chain, our own operations and our customers. The conclusions from our analysis will be incorporated in for example our sourcing strategy. The impact of future carbon pricing on Philips was deemed non-material due to the carbon neutrality in our operations by the end of 2020. More detailed information can be found on the Sustainability website.\n\n## Hazardous substances emissions\n\nIn the Healthy people, Sustainable planet program, chemical-reduction targets have been defined for the most relevant categories of substances for Philips, i.e. hazardous substance emissions and VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions. As part of our program, reduction targets have been agreed with our industrial sites.\n\nIn 2020, emissions of hazardous substances increased by 9%. The increase was driven by our Personal Health businesses, related to a specific production process in Asia, partially mitigated by operational changes. The emissions decreased by 12% in our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, and by 54% at one Connected Care site. Phasing-out harmful chemicals and process optimizations in our manufacturing sites, combined with changes in the production mix at multiple sites also had an upward effect. Changes to manufacturing processes and increased production at multiple sites also helped to reduce emissions.\n\n## VOC emissions\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## VOC emissions in tonnes\n\n|                       |   2016 |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Diagnosis & Treatment |     35 |     48 |     44 |     46 |     44 |\n| Connected Care        |      5 |      6 |      6 |      6 |      3 |\n| Personal Health       |     89 |     88 |     78 |     62 |     36 |\n| Philips Group         |    129 |    142 |    128 |    114 |     83 |\n\nVOC emissions decreased by 27% in 2020 to 83 tonnes. VOC emissions decreased in all segments. The Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, which represents 53% of total VOC emissions, decreased by 4% due to process optimizations and changes in production. VOC emissions in the Connected Care businesses decreased by 50% due to operational changes, partially offset by changes in production, and VOC emissions in the Personal Health businesses (representing 43% of total VOC emissions) decreased by 42% compared to 2019, mainly driven by newly installed filtering systems, process optimizations, changes in production volumes and operational changes.\n\n## ISO 14001 certification\n\nThe majority of Philips manufacturing sites are certified under the umbrella certificates of the businesses. In 2020, 81% of reporting manufacturing sites were certified, compared to 80% in 2019. The increase is caused by newly certified sites and organizational changes. The integration of newly acquired companies is in\n\n## Hazardous substances emissions",

This section provides additional information on (some of) the Social performance parameters reported in Social performance, starting on page 54\n\n## People development 13.4.1\n\nPhilips is on a multi-year journey to focus on experience-based career development, giving our people the opportunity to identify and gain the experiences necessary to support our health technology strategy and strengthen their employability. In 2020 we continued taking experimental learning to a new level across our 70:20:10 approach.\n\nAt the end of 2020 the number of active trainings, which are available to all employees, had increased to 5,852. By year-end, 773,257 courses had been taken with Philips University. In total, 835,575 hours were spent on training through Philips University in 2020, with 763,371 training completions.\n\n## 70% Critical career experiences\n\nWe support our people in navigating their own career and stimulate and educate our managers to have meaningful career dialogues with their people, in line with our \"Continuous Feedback and Continuous Talent Dialog approach\". To that end, we continue to fine-tune our Experience Maps, which describe the experiences people can gain to prepare for, or develop in, strategic roles. These maps are a tool for employees and managers to use during development dialogues and for employees to explore when thinking about career steps, to help them understand how to gain the experiences required to be ready for their next career step. By identifying the roles and experiences critical to our business strategy, we clarify development areas and transferable skills in support of cross-functional, lateral, traditional, as well as non-traditional career opportunities.\n\nWe have integrated the Experience Maps into our talent development approach, helping our people to plan and manage their careers. We also build awareness of experience-based careers through communications, prioritizing strategic roles and capabilities that directly support our health technology strategy.\n\n## 13.4 Sustainability statements",

        "page_content": "## 13.4.2 Sustainability statements\n\nWe continue to stimulate cross-moves (across businesses, between markets or functions) to promote collaboration and give people challenging learning experiences.\n\n## 20% Coaching and mentoring\n\nIn 2020, all leadership programs in Philips University included a coaching and/or mentoring element. In Shifting Gears (Executive Leadership Program), participants are coached by an executive coach and mentored by an Executive Committee member as part of their application projects. In Leading Adaptively, participants are coached by an executive coach, as well as a peer coaching group. The Philips Continuous Feedback process is embedded in these programs as part of the learning journey.\n\nTwo other Senior Leadership Programs - Leading Teams and License to Lead - build coaching and mentoring capabilities in our leaders through role playing and practicing with each other and their teams. In 2021 we will continue to drive the coaching and mentoring culture of our leaders through the following leadership programs and the addition of one at the senior level, Senior Leadership Program:\n\n- \u00b7 License to Lead\n- \u00b7 Leading Teams\n- \u00b7 Leading Adaptively\n\nThe Women in Action program, with female leaders becoming and seeking out coaches and mentors within the organization, was taken by 243 employees in 2020.\n\nThe Philips Mentoring Toolkit is available for all organizations in Philips to leverage and set up an internal mentoring program.\n\n## 10% Learning programs\n\nPhilips University continued to deliver upon its mission of a lifetime of learning in Philips by further optimizing the way learning is created and offered. By mirroring learning requests to company-wide strategic priorities and introducing smarter ways of working and supporting processes, we commit to deliver learning solutions that truly impact our people and Philips as a whole.\n\nIn 2020 we continued to improve the way we measure the development cost and impact of our learning.\n\n## Talent attraction 13.4.2\n\nIn 2020 the Talent Acquisition Business Partner (TABP) team was established to lead our Total Workforce Strategy, considering all sources of skill, capabilities, locations and change in the labor market to deliver the Workforce of the Future. TABPs partner with stakeholders, sharing external workforce intelligence,\n\nidentifying future-focused hiring needs and providing the resourcing strategy, forecast and buy plans. The Right Shoring & Sourcing efforts - steering improvements in workforce composition towards the Right shore (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the Right source (employees, contingent workers and outsourced) - yielded EUR 16.0 million cost savings in 2020.\n\nBy year-end 2020 we had onboarded over 12,900 new hires, with 24% of those roles filled by internal candidates. Our transformation-driven shift to align focused delivery models and strategies to the hardest-to-fill talent segments generated positive results. High-Value Targets are best-in-class companies identified for the skills needed to accelerate our transformation. These companies rank high on cultural fit, focus on business model innovation, and are aligned with strategic workforce planning/future vacancy demand.\n\nIn 2020 we innovated and further automated our recruitment process by using Artificial Intelligence in our selection process. Philips was also able to attract senior executives from High-Value Target companies to strengthen in terms of the strategic leadership needs of the future. 41% of all senior executives hired in 2020 were female.\n\nWe continued to invest in strategic Employer Brand and Recruitment Marketing initiatives as an enabler of our organizational People strategy and commitment to win the best talent in competitive labor market conditions. In addition to ongoing critical-segment talent attraction campaigns, talent pool nurturing programs through our global CRM, and always-on brand management across key careerrelated channels, the following 2020 initiatives supported enterprise-level stability and progress throughout the year:\n\n- \u00b7 Agile response to the COVID-19 pandemic in recruitment . Our response plan included a rapid transition from offline events, interviews and onboarding programs to virtual experiences, experiential employer brand content leveraging virtual reality and 360 video technologies, and communication about our COVID-19 relief efforts and protocols across key candidate information channels.\n- \u00b7 Insights collected on the career needs and wants of minority groups, specifically those identifying as Black . In support of the Black Lives Matter movement, we completed robust primary internal and external research on the Black labor market in 2020. The findings will inform important changes to internal employee experiences in a number of areas and external target recruitment programs in 2021.\n\nAdvancement of employee advocacy and personal brand ambassadorship across key talent segments . We continued to unlock the collective strength of our existing workforce to influence other top professionals, who share our passion for improving lives, to join the company. We did this by driving user growth on our main employee advocacy technology platform ( Social Daily ), running Me, Inc .",

In order to best support those affected, healthcare workers, in particular, employees stood strong to lend a hand or their specific skills. A few examples:\n\n- \u00b7 Employees volunteered for the Dutch Red Cross, where Philips software engineers used their IT expertise to build a digital cash-based aid platform that is fast, fair and safe, for those affected by humanitarian disasters can meet their own needs.\n- \u00b7 Philips employees have supported social entrepreneurs that feature in the partnership between Philips Foundation and Ashoka. Many entrepreneurs responded to the COVID-19 crisis and required our experts' support.\n- \u00b7 In the Netherlands, Philips volunteers supported elderly people, taking on everyday tasks, supporting them during lockdowns.\n- \u00b7 Employees also contributed by fundraising in 2020. Teaming up with NGOs Amref and PATH, employees supported community health workers in Kenya and breast cancer screenings in Peru. The EUR 211,210 raised will enable access to care for 472,000 people in underserved settings in these two countries. In addition, employees stepped up to support healthcare providers battling the COVID-19 pandemic, raising close to EUR 85,000 for emergency relief.\n\nThe structure of the volunteering program changed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety was a major issue. This has implied more skilled volunteering and less hands-on team activities in 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Philips employees will continue to use their time and expertise to support Philips Foundation's mission to provide access to quality healthcare for disadvantaged communities, which only seems to become more critical.\n\n## Building employability 13.4.4\n\nAt Philips, our goal to offer the best place to work for people who share our passion is not limited to employees on our payroll. In the Netherlands, for example, we run a special employment program, WGP (Werkgelegenheidsplan, or Philips Employment Scheme), to offer vulnerable groups of external jobseekers a\n\nwork experience placement, usually combined with training. Since the scheme's launch in 1983, over 13,200 people have participated, and around 70% found a regular job after taking part. In 2020, we had an outflow of 48 candidates, had 49 people joining the program, and offered extensions to 76 persons due to COVID-19. The WGP program is also accessible to refugees.\n\nA scientific study into the long-term impact of the WGP program has shown that the chance of finding a job after participating in the WGP program improved by 18%.\n\n## Philips Foundation 13.4.5\n\nThe Philips Foundation is a registered charity established in July 2014 - founded on the belief that innovation and collaboration can help solve some of the world's toughest healthcare challenges for the underserved and make essential impact. Reflecting our commitment to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) and 17 ( Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development ), the mission of the Philips Foundation is to reduce healthcare inequality by providing access to quality healthcare for disadvantaged communities through innovation. In 2020, Royal Philips supported the Philips Foundation with a contribution of EUR 6.7 million, and provided the operating staff as well as the expert assistance of skilled employees in the execution of the Foundation's programs.\n\nThe Philips Foundation fulfills its mission by deploying Philips' expertise and innovative solutions, by collaborating with key partners around the world and by providing financial support for the collaborative activities. In 2020, through a varied program, it joined forces with organizations such as UNICEF, Amref, Save the Children and the Red Cross. Increasingly, the Foundation is collaborating with social entrepreneurs in order to provide access to quality healthcare for underserved communities and make healthcare provision sustainable.\n\nThe Philips Foundation seeks to identify, develop and prove meaningful solutions and models that improve people's access to healthcare and have the potential to scale for a larger impact.\n\nSince the launch of the Philips Foundation, over 250 projects have been completed or are in progress throughout the world - engaging employees, providing technologies and products and addressing local healthcare system defects in connection with end beneficiaries. The work always starts by understanding the real need on the ground. In 2020, the Philips Foundation initiatives improved access to quality healthcare for more than 7.5 million people.\n\nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, the Philips Foundation has been striving to ensure access to critical care for those most in need by leveraging Philips' expertise, innovative products and solutions, in around 25 heavily",

Done in partnership with Philips offices, local NGOs and leading healthcare providers, the Philips Foundation has responded by providing point-of-care ultrasound solutions, patient monitoring, ventilators, emergency kits, medical supplies, and medical attention through mobile clinics.\n\nIn some cases, financial support was provided to leading response appeals, such as the ICRC, the Chief Ministers Funds of several Indian states and the local response initiatives of several National Societies of the Red Cross and worldwide through many local organizations. The financial support for the Virus Outbreak Data Access Network (VODAN) leads to a sustainable approach that connects collected data throughout Africa. It makes data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by humans and machines to stop the rapid spreading of the virus and share learnings on the virus behavior. The contribution to start a facemask factory by Refugee Company is another example of support aimed at durable effect.\n\nPhilips Foundation continued its regular program of new and running projects, predominantly focused on improving the comprehensive community and primary healthcare, with projects spanning many phases of the health continuum: from youth education and awareness on the health effects of air pollution to diagnosis and treatment, digital advancement, as well as training and task shifting of community health workers and midwives.\n\nIn total, including the initiatives addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, over 75 new projects were approved in 2020 globally, working with Philips employees to improve healthcare access and availability for vulnerable communities.\n\nFor more information about the Philips Foundation, its purpose and scope, as well as its latest annual report, visit the website.\n\n## Health and Safety performance 13.4.6\n\nIn 2020, the Health and Safety (H&S) programs were significantly affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic. However, Philips was able to manage the effects of COVID-19 and continue to develop and mature its Health and Safety programs.\n\nPolicy, Procedures and Management Systems: Philips continued to build a comprehensive global Health & Safety Management System with the deployment of one new and three updated Philips Corporate Safety Standards (PCSS) in 2020. More PCSS were originally planned but delayed due to COVID-19. As a result, a total of 68 PCSS were deployed by the end of 2020. The PCSS are supported with training materials in Philips University and Management Guidance notes. Management System Certifications ISO 45001 are in place for 25 manufacturing locations. Six country organizations are certified to ISO 45001, with further certifications planned for 2021.\n\nCompliance: In 2020, Philips completed the deployment of the Compliance tracking tool ENHESA to all operational sites, having assessed the regulations that may apply to them. The ENHESA tool was also deployed to all the market locations with over 100 employees in 2020, which are currently reviewing regulations to determine applicability. In 2020 one H&S audit was performed in the USA prior to COVID-19 impacting travel capabilities. All other audits scheduled for 2020 were postponed. However, in November 2020 a virtual Audit on a USA site was performed to trial wearable equipment and its effectiveness in remote auditing. Such audits, if successful, will be incorporated in the program going forward in order to reduce travel requirements and impacts.\n\nStructure and Responsibility : In 2020 the H&S organization supporting market activities was improved and consolidated. Health and Safety reviews were established with Market Operations leaders to raise the profile of H&S and drive safety programs with close leadership support.\n\nRisk assessments: In 2020, Health and Safety deployed the high-level risk assessment process to all operational sites and relevant markets to provide a strategic overview of the risk profile in Philips using the Philips Corporate Risk Assessment protocol. This has focused attention on the highest risks at operational sites. As a result, Philips has a better oversight of both exceptional risks and systemic risks that affect the whole company. This analysis will drive programs in 2021.\n\nTraining and Communication: In 2020 we offered an expanded library of Underwriters Ltd. (UL) safety e-learning courses (468 H&S courses in 10 languages) in the Philips University. Three H&S campaigns were held in 2020: Slips, Trips and Falls (Q1), Hand Safety (Q3) and Mental Health and Wellbeing (Q4). Preliminary results showed that the number of recordable accidents involved with Slip, Trips and Falls decreased following the campaign.\n\nOccupational Health: In 2020 focus was placed on enhancing two critical programs, Ergonomics and Mental Health and Wellbeing which were also identified as critical issues during the COVID-19 pandemic (Working from Home requirements). A Stress and Wellbeing campaign was deployed in Q4. The Occupational Health Team had primary involvement in managing the COVID-19 health and safety aspects (case reporting, trouble shooting, policy development and managing the employee inquiries).\n\nMetrics : Health and Safety metrics were further developed in 2020 to support existing metrics:\n\n- \u00b7 Fatalities: Unfortunately, one Philips employee was fatally injured in a road traffic accident in India in 2020. This happened when company transport taking employees home after a shift was involved in an accident during bad weather.",

The LWIC rate decreased to 0.27 compared to 0.33 in 2019. The total number of recordable cases for the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses segment decreased to 66 (80 in 2019), mainly due to fewer recorded incidents in North America.\n\n## Connected Care businesses\n\nHealth and Safety performance in the Connected Care businesses segment in 2020 was comparable with the prior year: 8 LWICs (7 in 2019). Correspondingly, the LWIC rate increased from 0.09 to 0.11 in 2020. The total number of recordable cases for the Connected Care businesses segment decreased to 23 in 2020 (26 in 2019), mainly driven by our factories in North America.\n\n## Personal Health businesses\n\nIn the Personal Health businesses segment, Health and Safety incidents increased in 2020, with 22 registered LWICs, compared to 15 in 2019. The LWIC rate increased from 0.13 in 2019 to 0.21 in 2020. There were 28 recordable cases in the Personal Health businesses segment in 2020 (19 in 2019). This increase was mainly due to more recorded incidents in North America and EMEA.\n\n## Business Continuity & Resilience\n\nPhilips has organized its Business Continuity & Resilience management to increase organization resilience, and maintain customer satisfaction, by continuing the delivery of products, services or solutions to our customers, at acceptable predefined levels, in time of disruption. Philips deployed and maintains a global Business Continuity Management System (BCMS), which is aligned to, and certified against, the international standard for Business Continuity ISO 22301.\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic significantly affected Philips' global operations in many ways, including government-mandated factory and office lockdowns, supply chain shortages, travel restrictions, and ensuring employee health and safety. The first signs of COVID-19 reached Philips at the end of 2019. The Philips Global Business Continuity team activated and led a small taskforce to monitor the unfolding situation in China, which turned into a global pandemic. In this",

Business Continuity validated the recovery scenarios of all organizational entities in scope. The situation was monitored via daily calls with the organizational entities in China, and daily updates were sent to the Executive Committee and Operational Leaders.\n\nMid-February the pandemic was officially designated as a Philips Group crisis, and the Group Crisis Operations Team (GCOT) was activated to provide a global integrated response. The Philips Global Business Continuity team handed over the coordination to the GCOT. This enabled Philips to centralize its crisis activities and to enable a unified approach to develop, deploy and communicate the Work from Home (WFH) and Return to Workplace (RTW) protocols to safeguard Philips' triple duty of care: meeting critical customer needs, safeguarding the health and safety of our employees, and ensuring business continuity. The deployment of mass notification functionality was accelerated to enable alerts to employees and crisis management teams. Based on best practices, a new standard scenario 'Outbreak of a Virus' was pushed to all organizational entities to be used during this crisis.\n\nAs a result, Philips was able to maintain manufacturing operations (and in some cases increase output) and all services to ensure support for our customers, with limited interruption to key service and support activities to hospitals.\n\n## Supplier indicators 13.4.7\n\nPhilips' purpose to improve people's health and well-being extends throughout our value chain. At Philips, we have a direct business relationship with approximately 3,300 product and component suppliers and 16,000 service providers. Our supply chain sustainability strategy is updated annually through a structured process, combined with dedicated multi-stakeholder dialogues. Our most recent stakeholder dialogue took place in June 2019. From this, we have developed multiple programs aimed at driving sustainable improvement. These programs cover compliance with our policies, improvement of our suppliers' sustainability performance, our approach towards responsible sourcing of minerals, and reducing the environmental impact of our supply base.\n\n## Supplier sustainability compliance\n\nTwo core policy documents form the basis of our supplier sustainability compliance approach: the Supplier Sustainability Declaration and the Regulated Substances List.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD)\n\nThe SSD sets out the standards and behaviors Philips requires from its suppliers. The SSD is based on the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct, in alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and key international human rights standards, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the UN Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights. It covers topics such as Labor, Health & Safety, Environment, Ethics, and Management Systems.\n\n## Regulated Substances List (RSL)\n\nThe RSL specifies the chemical substances regulated by legislation. Suppliers are required to follow all the requirements stated in the RSL. Substances are marked as restricted or declarable.\n\nAll suppliers are required to commit to the SSD and RSL. Through integration of a Sustainability Agreement (SA) in our General Purchase Agreement, suppliers declare compliance to both the SSD and RSL. Upon request, they provide additional information and evidence.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Performance (SSP) - 'Beyond Auditing'\n\nIn 2016, Philips moved away from its traditional approach to audit suppliers, which it had been taking since 2004. Insights from data analysis showed this old approach was insufficient to drive sustainable improvements. Our SSP approach, first piloted in 2016, focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 a systematic approach to improve the sustainability of our supply chain\n- \u00b7 continuous improvement against a set of recognized and global references\n- \u00b7 collaboration, increased transparency, clear commitments, and ensuring suppliers meet the agreed targets\n- \u00b7 encouraging our suppliers, industry peers and cross-industry peers to adopt our approach\n\nThis systematic approach is shown in the figure below and is a high-level representation of the SSP program.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 13.4.7 Sustainability statements\n\nFirst, a set of references, international standards and Philips requirements are used to develop the Frame of Reference, which covers management systems, environment, health & safety, business ethics and human rights. For each, the maturity level of suppliers is identified in the Program Execution Wheel, which assesses suppliers against the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. Suppliers are then categorized through the Supplier Classification model, which differentiates on the basis of supplier maturity, resulting in supplier-specific proposals for improvement. The SSP process is monitored and adjusted through continuous feedback loops. The outcome of the SSP assessment is a supplier sustainability score ranging from 0 to 100. This score is based on supplier performance in environmental management, health & safety, business ethics, and human rights.\n\n## Supplier classification\n\nSupplier selection for the program is initially based on criticality, which is determined through an assessment of the supplier's associated risks and opportunities, such as strategic importance and annual spend. After this, the engagement strategy is tailored based on the current performance in terms of sustainability.\n\nThere are four different engagement approaches: BiC (Best in Class), SSIP (Supplier Sustainability Improvement Plan), DIY (Do It Yourself) and PZT (Potential Zero Tolerance). The PZT status is a temporary status and requires immediate attention and action. Depending on the categorization, suppliers are engaged in different ways to improve their sustainability performance.\n\nIf a (Potential) Zero Tolerance is identified, immediate action is taken. If the requested additional information and evidence lead to the conclusion that there is no structural Zero Tolerance, the supplier's status will be changed and the supplier will go back to the original track in the program. If the conclusion gives rise to a structural Zero Tolerance, the supplier is required to:\n\n- \u00b7 propose a plan to mitigate and/or resolve the identified Zero Tolerance(s)\n- \u00b7 commit to structurally resolving the Zero Tolerance\n- \u00b7 provide regular updates and evidence\n- \u00b7 avoid quick-fixing\n\n## Philips defines six Zero Tolerances:\n\n- \u00b7 Fake or falsified records\n- \u00b7 Child and/or forced labor\n- \u00b7 Immediate threats to the environment\n- \u00b7 Immediate threats to worker health and safety\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with regulatory and/or Philips requirements\n- \u00b7 Workers' monthly income (covering salary for regular hours and overtime, tax deductions, social insurance) failing to meet regulatory requirements\n\nFor more details on the SSP process, refer to the SSP brochure.\n\n## Our 2020 results\n\nIn 2020, eight zero tolerances were found across the following categories: health and safety, remuneration, and environmental impact. Most cases related to fire safety risks at our suppliers. Four of the eight cases were successfully closed in 2020. The remaining are still pending closure, while having active mitigation plans in place.\n\nPhilips measures the impact of SSP engagements through the number of lives improved in the supply chain. This is derived from the improvements that suppliers make in their performance. To determine improvements, we calculate the pro rata change in performance from one year to the next.\n\nIn 2020, the overall year-on-year improvement in performance is 36% for suppliers that entered the program in 2019. The number of employees impacted at suppliers participating in the SSP program was approximately 302,000. For those workers, labor conditions improved, the risk of serious injury reduced, and the negative environmental impact of suppliers was brought down. For a detailed break-down of percentage improvements realized in the past year, refer to the table below.",

Of the population of suppliers that entered the program in the years before 2020, 237 suppliers were still active in 2020.\n\nAs part of the 2020 adoption of our new ESG commitments, we have set the target to improve the lives of 1 million workers in our supply chain by 2025. To achieve this, a significant ramp-up is required in the coming years.\n\n## Additional progress made in 2020\n\nApart from the inclusion of additional suppliers annually into the award-winning SSP program, Philips is actively applying the latest insights in data science and machine learning methods to make the SSP program more efficient in determining the sustainability maturity of suppliers, while also increasing the effectiveness of our supplier improvement approach.\n\nIn 2020, a machine learning tool was developed, which is able to predict expert scorings on detailed pieces of evidence, thereby reducing the time spent on assessments. This leaves more room for experts to support suppliers in their capability building, by sharing best practices and creating business cases that enable improvements.\n\nIn addition, Philips launched its newly developed SSP IT platform, which fully supports the entire engagement process, from onboarding to data analysis. It is set up in such a way that other companies can easily start using the system for their own supplier engagements. The program design also enables various codes\n\nof conduct to be included. Through public speaking engagements and 1-on-1 conversations with cross-industry peers, Philips is making the methodology available to other companies that want to make a sustainable impact in their supply chain.\n\n## Responsible Sourcing of Minerals\n\nThe supply chains for minerals are long and complex. Philips does not source minerals directly from mines as there are typically 7+ tiers between end-user companies like Philips and the mines where the minerals are extracted. The extraction of minerals can take place in conflict-affected and high-risk regions, where mining is often informal and unregulated and carried out at artisanal smallscale mines (ASM). These ASMs are vulnerable to exploitation by armed groups and local traders. Within this context, there is an increased risk of severe human rights violations (forced labor, child labor or widespread sexual violence), unsafe working conditions or environmental concerns.\n\nPhilips addresses the complexities of the minerals supply chains through a continuous due diligence process, combined with active participation in multistakeholder initiatives to promote the responsible sourcing of minerals.\n\n## Conflict minerals due diligence\n\nEach year, Philips investigates its supply chain to identify smelters of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in its supply chain and we have committed to not purchasing raw materials, sub-assemblies, or supplies found to contain conflict minerals.\n\nPhilips applies collective cross-industry leverage through active engagement via the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI, formerly known as the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI)). RMI identifies smelters that can demonstrate, through an independent third-party audit, that the minerals they procure are conflict-free. In 2020, Philips continued to actively direct its supply chain towards these smelters.\n\n## 13.4.7 Sustainability statements",

We use cobalt predominantly in lithium-ion batteries. As part of this expansion, we engaged suppliers that provide materials containing cobalt. In 2020, we reached a 100% response rate. In addition, we performed smelter outreach on several occasions. Where appropriate, we worked with direct suppliers to facilitate alternative sourcing.",

        "page_content": "## Women's empowerment through access to credits and savings in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n## Multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing of minerals\n\nWomen represent 45 to 50% of the artisanal small-scale mining workforce. Studies have shown that they often struggle to access formal credit and savings. When they can get credit they often have to accept unfavorable repayment terms, otherwise they have to depend on informal financial practices. The Artisanal Mining Women's Empowerment Credit & Savings project addressed this issue by supporting the creation of village savings and loans associations for women and men in artisanal gold mining communities, in an effort to promote entrepreneurship and economic security.\n\nIn contrast to microfinance institutions, the interest paid on credit go back into the communal fund so members see their savings increase over time. The project also facilitated sensitization on gender equality and led to discussions with female members of associations and their partners about household finances, challenging traditional stereotypes and gender roles. The project provided financial literacy training to women who access credit from their association, to undertake new entrepreneurial activities around mine sites\n\n## Making due diligence activities more efficient and effective for miners in Bolivia and Burkina Faso\n\nThe CADD Project consists of the development and pilot deployment of an open-source, public framework for upstream supply chain stakeholders to operationalize requirements from the OECD Due Diligence Guidance. Such a framework is an essential implementation mechanism for companies operating in, and procuring from countries covered by European regulation 2017/821 where no upstream due diligence program is established. It provides a solution to systemic constraints on upstream due diligence scalability, sustainability, accountability and reliability - the most significant challenge to responsible mineral procurement globally.\n\nMining and mineral trade operators in countries covered by EU regulation are enabled to secure compliant access to international markets while minimizing due diligence costs. This in turn is expected to boost due diligence uptake by upstream operators and incentivize formal trade - an important step towards improving the socio-economic conditions of artisanal small-scale mining communities in conflict-affected and high-risk areas\n\nWe believe that multi-stakeholder collaboration in the responsible sourcing of minerals is the most viable approach for addressing the complexities of minerals value chains.\n\n## European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM)\n\nPhilips is a founding partner of EPRM and has been a strategic member since its inception in May 2016. EPRM is a multi-stakeholder partnership between governments, companies, and civil society actors working toward more sustainable minerals supply chains. The goal of EPRM is to create better social and economic conditions for mine workers and local mining communities by increasing the number of mines that adopt responsible mining practices in Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).\n\nEPRM is an accompanying measure to the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation dedicated to making real change 'on the ground'. Through EPRM, Philips financially supports activities to improve responsible mining practices in mining areas in CAHRAs and shares our knowledge and practice in conducting due diligence. Since 2018, Philips has actively participated in a working group focused on making the on-the-ground projects financially and strategically effective. From here, the call for new proposals was developed, decisions on co-funding were made, and criteria for scale-up potential were created.\n\nSince January 2019, Philips has been an active board member in EPRM, taking the seat of vice-chair by representing the industrials pillar.\n\n## IRBC Responsible Gold Agreement\n\nIn June 2017 Philips signed the Responsible Gold Agreement, joining a coalition to work on improving international responsible business conduct across the gold value chain. Signees include goldsmiths, jewelers, recyclers, NGOs, electronics companies, trade unions, and the Dutch government. This partnership intends to bring about cooperation between companies, government, trade unions, and NGOs to prevent abuses within production chains. From September 2019, Philips represents gold and precious metal, recycling, and electronic companies in the steering committee of the Responsible Gold Agreement. From this partnership, Philips co-developed a project with several other parties including civil society actors, to facilitate sourcing of responsible gold from Uganda. The project is aimed specifically at artisanal and small-scale mines (ASM) and works to establish a sustainable, traceable gold supply chain with improved working conditions for miners and free of child labor. The approach is designed to be scaled up and serves as a potential blueprint for mines in other regions. Since 2019, Philips is also an active member of the steering committee of the Responsible Gold Agreement.",

When it comes to climate change, we have adopted a multipronged approach: reducing the environmental impact of our products, committing to carbon neutrality in our own operations, and engaging with our supply chain to reduce their carbon footprint. Through our partnership with the CDP supply chain program, Philips motivates its suppliers to disclose emissions, embed board responsibility on climate change, and actively work on reduction activities.\n\nSince 2011 we have been partnering with the CDP Supply Chain, through which we invite suppliers to disclose their environmental performance and carbon intensity. This year, there was a response rate of 92% (2019: 80%).\n\n## Philips Group\n\n## Supplier response rate to CDP questionnaire\n\n| 2018   |     | 2019   | 2020   |\n|--------|-----|--------|--------|\n| 77%    | 80% | 92%    |        |\n\nFrom this group, 61% engaged in emission reduction initiatives (2019: 66%). In addition, 61% committed to carbon emission targets (2019: 59%). Furthermore, 43% of the responding suppliers have set science-based targets of which 31% was have been formally approved. Our suppliers undertook projects in 2020 that resulted in savings on carbon emissions amounting to 17 million metric tonnes CO2.\n\nAs part of 2020 adoption of our new ESG commitments, we have set the target to actively engage 80% of our supply base to:\n\n- 1. disclose scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions annually\n- 2. implement de-carbonization strategies in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement\n\n## Governance indicators 13.5\n\nIn 2020, Philips further reinforced its commitments as a purpose-driven company with the announcement of an enhanced and fully integrated approach to doing business responsibly and sustainably. This section provides additional information on (some of) the Governance parameters reported in Governance, starting on page 59\n\nIn 2020, a total of 571 concerns were reported via Philips Speak Up ( Ethics Line ) and through our network of GBP Compliance Officers, an increase of 5% year-onyear (2019: 545 concerns).\n\nWhile this is a continuation of the upward trend reported since 2014, the year when Philips updated its General Business Principles and deployed a strengthened global communication campaign, the increase is flattening. We still believe this upward trend remains in line with our multi-year efforts to encourage our employees to express their concerns, but the extraordinary business conditions in 2020 make it imprudent to draw any specific conclusions from these numbers.\n\nSpecifically in 2020, we once more focused on increasing awareness on Integrity and on the importance of speaking up, also following the conclusions of the deep-dives we executed after our 2019 biennial Business Integrity Survey. Amongst others, we fully revised our GBP Dialogue set-up, a company-wide initiative during which managers were asked to hold Quality and Integrity dialogues with their teams. Furthermore, over 65,000 of our online employees completed their yearly code of conduct e-learning, while at the same time almost 14,000 customer-facing colleagues participated in dedicated compliance trainings. Where we could initially execute these biennial trainings face to face as normal, COVID-travel restrictions forced us to complete these efforts through virtual sessions.\n\nWhen looking at the percentages, the increase in reports is specifically visible in North America, which is now responsible for 45% of all reported concerns (2019: 42%). EMEA and Latin America remained stable at 22% and 12% respectively, while the APAC region showed a small decline to 21%, compared to 23% in 2019. .",

In 2020 there were 342 reports in this category, compared to 320 in 2019. This represents 60% of the total number of concerns, which is again a slight increase on 2019 (59%).\n\nThe majority of the concerns reported in the 'Treatment of employees' category relate to 'Respectful treatment' and 'Equal and fair treatment' (160 and 52 respectively). The 'Respectful treatment' sub-category generally relates to concerns about verbal abuse, (sexual) harassment, and hostile work environments. 'Equal and fair treatment' primarily relates to concerns about favoritism, discrimination and unfair treatment in the workplace. In the 'Treatment of employees' category, 51% of cases originated from North America, which is more than in 2019 (49%).\n\nThe second most-reported type of concern relates to 'Business Integrity', which accounted for 22% of total cases reported in 2020, down from 25% in 2019. These concerns originated primarily from the APAC region (39%), followed by North America (24%), EMEA (22%) and Latin America (15%).\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAlso in the area of GBP concerns, the global COVID-19 pandemic has made a visible impact. The significant increase in especially the number of Health & Safety cases, but also cases relating to working hours, can be attributed to employees raising concerns around how the virus is impacting their work environment. As we attach great importance to our employees' safety, health and well-being, also as part of our triple duty of care, these cases were all addressed swiftly and rigorously.",

The table above gives an overview of the number of reported concerns that were substantiated (i.e. were found to constitute a breach of our General Business Principles) by the subsequent investigation.\n\nOf the 409 reports from 2020 that were closed during the same year, (352 in 2019), 110 were substantiated, which represents 27% of the total number reported and closed (32% in 2019). In 2020, 27% of the 'Treatment of employees' cases were substantiated, compared to 28% in 2019 (2018: 28%, 2017: 26%). In addition, 36% of the 'Business Integrity' reports were closed as substantiated in 2020, compared with 44% in 2019 (2018: 45%, 2017: 42%).\n\nIn addition to the above, 213 concerns that were still open at the end of 2019 were closed during the course of 2020. A total of 77 (36%) of these concerns were substantiated after investigation.\n\nOf the 188 closed concerns that were substantiated, 108 were followed up with disciplinary measures ranging from termination of employment and written warnings to training and coaching. In other cases, corrective action was taken, which varied from strengthening the business processes to increasing awareness of the expected standard of business conduct.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement 13.5.2\n\nPhilips constantly engages in a range of activities and interactions with key stakeholders. Meaningful, effective and informed stakeholder engagement is a cornerstone to achieving the company's commitment to doing business responsibly and sustainably.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nWe look at sustainability within the overarching ESG framework of environmental responsibility, social value creation and corporate governance. With regard to its environmental responsibility, Philips focuses on making a material impact, which means prioritizing initiatives that deliver tangible value. Our strategy is in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals 12 ( Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns ) and 13 ( Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ).\n\nIn the social dimension, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 ( Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages ) and as part of our commitment to improve 2 billion lives by 2025, Philips aims to expand access to care for 300 million people in underserved communities, both in developing and developed countries.\n\nWe team up with our partners to deliver sustainable value, drive global change and reduce our shared environmental footprint, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 17 ( Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development ).\n\n## Collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nCOVID-19 has shown what can be achieved when parties across all sectors work together. Our long-term or newly created partnerships have been key enablers in making impact at scale. We have worked with our partners and key stakeholders to ramp up production, keep our supply chain running, exchange health data, and deliver care remotely with innovative tele-health solutions.\n\n## For example, Philips and the African Union - through the Africa Medical Supplies\n\nPlatform - will provide medical equipment and expertise to help meet the immediate needs of medical practitioners and COVID-19 patients.

Also, Philips entered into a collaboration with the American Telemedicine Association to drive future telehealth strategies across hospital settings into the home.\n\n## Expanding Universal Health coverage\n\nWe can only achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030 if the public, private and non-profit sectors work together. As a member of the UHC2030 Private Sector constituency, Philips is committed to making healthcare accessible, with a focus on innovation.\n\nIn the US, for example, Philips is partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to expand the VA's telehealth capabilities. This will include providing care to rural veterans through telehealth-capable appointment spaces set up in local communities, but also deployment of the world's largest tele-critical care system, further integrating tele-health and delivering quality care for veterans.\n\nAs part of our commitment to improve the lives of 2 billion people by 2025, Philips aims to expand access to care for 300 million people in underserved communities, both in developing and developed countries. For example, as part of an initiative to reduce maternal health by 50% and new-born mortality by 30% in health facilities in Africa over five years, Philips recently partnered with the Government of the Republic of Congo and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA,) to launch the 'EBOTELI' maternal and neonatal healthcare project. After testing the model with 19 facilities across district hospitals in Congo, reaching approximately. 130,000 women and 75,0000 newborns, the partners aim to further scale and replicate the project in neighboring countries, while working with public health staff and public infrastructure at the same time, to make sure interventions last beyond project term.\n\nFinally, together with the Philips Foundation and key strategic partners, Philips is supporting several community-based initiatives, such as the Nairobi 'Maker Space' project in Kenya, which fosters and enables local health technology innovation and entrepreneurship with the aim to improve mother, newborn and child health. Also, via the Philips Foundation, Philips has collaborated with UK-based charity Global Action Plan and other environmental pressure groups tohelp UK government and local authorities improve air quality in and around UK schools.\n\n## Driving sustainable healthcare across Europe\n\nLike elsewhere, the COVID-19 global crisis has dominated the European Union (EU) political scene since March 2020. In the early months of the pandemic, Philips' efforts focused on ensuring the functioning of the global supply chain for life-saving medical equipment. Since May, the European Commission, the European Parliament and EU leaders have been discussing and ultimately agreeing on a recovery plan for Europe. Thanks to regular and structured\n\nconversations with EU policy-makers, Philips was able to share lessons learnt from the crisis, examples of accelerated digital transformation in healthcare, and our vision for future EU health systems - resilient enough to serve all patients in normal times and in times of pandemic.\n\nDue to the lockdown measures, nearly all meetings and events in Brussels have progressively been digitized, postponed or cancelled since the outbreak. Continuing to build its thought leadership and strengthen its reputation as a health technology leader with our key EU stakeholders, Philips leveraged its partnership with POLITICO and hosted virtual high-level panel discussions and working groups with EU policy-makers, medical professionals, patient associations and academics around digital technology and the Green Deal. In particular, Philips sought to help shape the discussion around the European Health Data Space, and played an active role during the Ministerial Summit for the launch of Gaia-x.\n\nThrough its membership of the All Policies for a Healthy Europe Coalition, Philips aims to position citizens' health and well-being at the heart of EU policy-making. Philips was also a partner of the Annual Conference of the European Health Management Association (EHMA), sharing views on the potential of data and AIdriven solutions in healthcare, and defining the different ways to unlock that potential.\n\nAs a member of the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition (DSGC), and together with other parties, a manifest was delivered to the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation (Sigrid Kaag) to reaffirm our commitment to green recovery after COVID-19, on a Dutch, and European level, and to be guided by the SDGs and Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nPhilips has been chairman of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the Netherlands since 2018. Now in its fifth year, and together with other parties, UNGC published a guideline on 'Stakeholder inclusion, as accelerator for the sustainable development goals' in 2020.\n\n## Driving circular economy\n\nAt Philips, we engage with multiple stakeholders to drive circular practices worldwide. Through co-chairmanship of PACE (Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy), Philips CEO Frans van Houten is helping the industry to formulate strategies for change, spearheading implementation, and assembling a coalition of like-minded companies prepared to make circular economy pledges. Currently, PACE activities run across China, South-East Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America. Its Leadership Group grew from over 70 global leaders in 2019 to 90 in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## 13.5.2 Sustainability statements\n\nPhilips is an active driver of the Capital Equipment coalition aimed at accelerating the implementation of circular practices in the business operations of capital equipment manufacturers. Together with other parties, Philips contributed to the Circularity Gap report, providing a clear roadmap for driving circular action. The report references our refurbishing efforts through our Diamond Select Program.\n\nPhilips supports the Ellen MacArthur Foundation . Together with more than 50 global leaders, Philips pledged to build back better and accelerate the transition to a circular economy, creating solutions that combine economic opportunity with benefits to wider society and the environment.\n\nPhilips participates in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), whose Circular Transition Indicators (CTI) framework enables companies to take ownership of their circular transition.\n\n## Driving climate action\n\nWe already source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources, and finance projects in developing regions to compensate unavoidable emissions. And thanks to our focused approach to drive down emissions, we are now carbon-neutral in our operations. We are developing more and more products and services that are circular-ready, and we continue to optimize the design of our products and solutions to make them more energy-efficient. But to really mitigate climate change we need to speed up our efforts and drive scale beyond our own operations.\n\nPhilips received the prestigious double 'A List' award for eighth year in a row, from global environmental impact non-profit CDP, for our efforts to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low-carbon economy.\n\nIn 2020, we teamed up with key strategic stakeholders, partners and customers during high-level events and stakeholder meetings - including annual WEF meetings in Davos, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders and NY Climate Week to scale and drive the adoption of green practices and a smooth transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, to deliver the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Global partnerships and industry research\n\nPhilips maintains a close stakeholder relations network, through strategic global and European partnerships and by commissioning global industry research. Some examples are mentioned below.\n\nPhilips is proud to continue as a strategic partner of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the international organization for public-private cooperation committed to improving the state of the world. The Forum engages political, business and other leaders to help shape global, regional and industry agendas. In 2020, Philips was an active contributor to WEF programs and strategic platforms to catalyze and\n\naccelerate impact-oriented programs on value-based care, AI and digital technologies, and circular economy. Philips is also a part of WEF's Great Reset Platform to cooperate with global stakeholders in managing the direct consequences of the COVID-19.\n\nPhilips worked with WEF International Business Council (IBC) on preparing the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics framework published on September 22, 2020, a set of common metrics for companies to align their mainstream reporting on performance against ESG indicators and track their contributions towards the SDGs on a consistent basis as well as for sustainable value creation.\n\nPhilips contributed to a framework for corporate action published on September 17, 2020 by WEF to drive and harness the uptake of advanced technologies to enable the Global Goals to become a reality by 2030.\n\nPhilips is a member of the European Round Table for Industry (ERT), which includes CEOs and Chairs from around 55 of Europe's leading multinational companies. ERT strives for a strong, open and competitive Europe, with the EU and its Single Market as a driver for inclusive growth and sustainable prosperity. In 2020, ERT announced a declaration of support from the business leaders for a climate-neutral Europe by 2050 and a net greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030.\n\n## Engaging with Healthcare Professionals and Key Opinion Leaders: The Future Health Index\n\nThe Future Health Index (FHI) is a research-based platform designed to help determine the readiness of countries to address global health challenges and build sustainable, fit-for-purpose national health systems. By examining the role of technology in the health system, the aim of FHI is to provide actionable insights to healthcare professionals, governments and patients that will also improve their experience with healthcare.\n\nThe Future Health Index 2020 report features intriguing insights into the next generation of healthcare professionals, a group that will form most of the healthcare workforce over the next 20 years. The research explores this group's expectations around technology, training and job satisfaction, and the reality of their experiences as healthcare professionals. The research gives a clear mandate to healthcare leaders to respond to the concerns of this younger generation of healthcare professionals. Six months into the COVID-19 crisis, we ran an additional survey to find out how the crisis impacted the younger healthcare professionals.",

(the Company) based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. An audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nIn our opinion, the sustainability information presents, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:\n\n- \u00b7 The policy and business operations with regard to sustainability\n- \u00b7 The thereto related events and achievements for the year 2020\n\nin accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards (option Comprehensive) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and applied supplemental reporting criteria as included in section 'Approach to sustainability reporting' of the annual report.\n\nThe sustainability information consists of chapter 'Environmental, Social and Governance' except for sections 'Remuneration policy' and 'Risk management approach', and chapter 'Sustainability statements' of the annual report.\n\n## Basis for our opinion\n\nWe have performed our audit on the sustainability information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N, 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen' (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports), which is a specific Dutch Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, ' Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ' . Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section Our responsibilities for the audit of the sustainability information of our report.\n\nWe are independent of Koninklijke Philips N.V. in accordance with EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. This includes that we do not perform any activities that could result in a conflict of interest with our independent assurance engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## 13.6 Sustainability statements\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe sustainability information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria. Koninklijke Philips N.V. is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting.\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the sustainability information are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in section 'Approach to sustainability reporting' of the annual report.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure sustainability information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Materiality\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for each relevant part of the sustainability information and for the sustainability information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the Company.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified during the audit and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our audit\n\nThe sustainability information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and estimates.
