I would therefore like to once again express our sympathies to all of those who have suffered from this calamity since last year.\n\nAmid the restrictions placed on the movement of and contact  between  people  throughout  the  globe,  Toray  Group  has endeavored to manage our businesses in a way that fulfills our responsibility to continue supplying products as a basic materials\n\nmanufacturer.  Similarly,  we have prioritized the health of our employees in Japan and around the world, as well as the  prevention  of  infection by the virus. Unable to avoid the impacts of stagnation in production  and  consumption activities  across  the  globe, however,  consolidated  revenue for fiscal 2020 declined 9.9% compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a51,883.6 billion, and  core  operating income  fell  28.1%  to  \u00a590.3 billion. Meanwhile, operating income declined 51.3% to \u00a555.9 billion and profit attributable  to  owners  of  parent declined by 45.6% to \u00a545.8 billion as a U.S. carbon fiber subsidiary recorded an impairment loss.\n\nAlthough these challenges show  how  we  were  significantly affected by the COVID19  pandemic  during  fiscal 2020,  this  actually  allowed me  to  fully  experience  the power of Toray Group. First and  foremost,  we  demonstrated our strengths in developing and providing materials for  a  variety  of  applications and met the expectations of a world that demands a sustainable society, thereby expanding  the  ways  in  which  we deliver new value to society. And because our high-performance, high-grade, and innovative  materials  are  realized through  the  ultra-long-term accumulation  of  technology that  is  unique  to  Japanese companies, I am certain the roles played by Toray Group\n\n## Contributing to Build a Sustainable Society by Innovation of Materials\n\nwill only continue to expand into the future. In addition, given that we produce 70 to 80% of our main products outside of Japan due to having advanced local production for local consumption on a global basis, our ability to maintain operations despite the restrictions on movement has served as a major advantage amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Unwavering management with a long-term perspective\n\nIn order to realize the perspectives of the world which consider",

Similarly, we will seize\n\nupon the direction these changes in the world taken under TORAY VISION 2030 (VISION 2030), our 10-year long-term corporate vision formulated as  the  milestone  for  these  efforts,  and  under Project AP-G 2022 (AP-G 2022), a 3-year medium-term management program we established to achieve the long-term vision. Along with our annual plans, we are steadily advancing management in a way that tackles existing problems in a manner that is founded on the three time frames of long-term, medium-term, and present. Steadily building a response to these existing problems will help define a path to the future and solidify our business foundation. In this way, our basic approach to management based on a long-term perspective remains unchanged.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Toray Group's performance has taken a positive turn. Although economic recovery varies by country depending on their progress  in  vaccinations  and  economic  measures, and despite the fact that an end to skyrocketing crude oil prices and other external environmental factors remain as deeply uncertain as ever, automotive applications and IT-related materials are performing strongly. Against this backdrop, we foresee the COVID-19 pandemic coming to an end and the global economy generally returning to a growth trajectory during fiscal 2022, the final year of AP-G 2022. Likewise, Toray Group will, in a timely manner, organize a system to increase production and supply for those markets forecasted\n\nto see a recovery and expansion in demand, and will endeavor to minimize the impact of more immediate  issues,  such  as  skyrocketing  raw material prices, by working to use formula pricing that links market conditions to product prices.\n\n## Materials change our lives\n\nWith materials as the starting point of everything the world produces, we engage in business operations under the conviction that 'materials, which form the base of all products, have the power to intrinsically change society.'\n\nAs the digital economy advances, the makeup of the industrial structure is shifting from a focus on hardware to software, which is evolving to allow the world to steadily realize those ideas that were once only dreams. Yet, even AI, an area that is receiving the greatest amount of attention, cannot exist without development in hardware like high-speed logic elements and high-capacity memory elements. And it is the materials that comprise the hardware that are the basis for the hardware-based innovation, so there is no question that \"innovation starting from materials\" has become ever more common. Even in the technologically mature fibers and textiles industry, for example, we have developed innovative conjugate spinning technologies like NANODESIGN TM , which have enabled us to add completely new functions and textures, and to deliver new added-value. In other words, materials hold an unlimited potential to drive innovation.\n\n## Expanding 'Innovation through Co-creation'\n\n'Innovation through Co-creation' is a unique feature and strength of the Toray Group Value Creation Process. Simply developing innovative materials alone will not give rise to markets, however. Which is why we require partners who will provide applications, who are willing to accept",

In recent years in particular, global environmental issues have become serious topics of discussion in those countries around the world that have experienced torrential rains and severe cold waves as a\n\nresult of abnormal weather.\n\nunfamiliar materials, and who possess a culture and vision overflowing with a readiness to take on new challenges, like Toray.\n\nOur collaboration with Fast Retailing Co., Ltd. (Fast Retailing), which has produced revolutionary  products  like  HEATTECH TM ,  AIRism TM ,  and Ultra Light Down TM , is now in its twenty-second year, and has grown stronger with each passing year. This historic co-creation was the result of the meeting between Toray, with its conviction that 'fibers and textiles is still a growth industry when looked at globally' in an era when many industries were moving away from these, and Fast Retailing, with its philosophy of 'Changing clothes. Changing conventional wisdom. Change the world.' With their leaders sharing the same vision, the burning desire of Toray's engineers to undertake challenges drove breakthroughs in response to the requests of Fast Retailing, which sincerely believes that its clothing concepts can change  the  world.  Similarly,  our  alliance  with The Boeing Company based in the U.S.A., which was only dreaming of building aircraft from carbon fibers at its outset, is a partnership that was achieved  specifically  because  both  companies share a corporate culture that values the continuous pursuit of innovation.\n\nToray Group has a history of focusing on environmental management, and we stated achieving 'a net zero emissions world, where greenhouse gas emissions are completely offset by absorption,' in other words carbon neutrality, as a goal in the Toray Group Sustainability Vision. In order to execute what we propose, we are advancing our 'contributions to solving climate change issues through the value chain' for society as part of the GR Business, while engaging in efforts to 'address climate change across business activities' within the Group, such as reducing GHG emissions at the manufacturing stage.\n\nThe GR Business contributes to reductions in GHG emissions throughout society by supplying various materials such as those that decrease the weight and improve the fuel efficiency of aircraft  and  automobiles.  We  believe  that  'technologies that contribute to a circular economy' and  'hydrogen-related  technologies'  will  also serve as major drivers in achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In contributing to a circular economy, we will work to expand the business for fibers and textiles made of raw materials recycled from used polyester (PET) bottles, and to build a recycling system for release PET films used in electronic component applications. In terms of\n\nIt is likely that more and more companies will seek out innovativeness from the power of materials as the world becomes flooded with things and only those things that offer unprecedented value will be chosen. Against this backdrop, we will increasingly accelerate 'Innovation through Co-creation' together with various partners that boldly challenge breakthroughs.",

Likewise, Toray Group's contributions to carbon neutrality through the value chain will likely increase to an immeasurable scale in the future.\n\nAs Toray Group is advocating for environmental management, in addition to the environmental contributions we are making externally based\n\non the products that we have developed and with our partnerships, we believe that Toray Group's business activities themselves should also be carbon neutral. We will therefore focus our energies on various initiatives for this purpose, including switching to zero-emissions electricity and fuel, increasing the efficiency of existing production processes, developing low-GHG emission manufacturing technologies, developing recycling and bio-related technologies, and absorbing and recycling CO2, etc.\n\n## Accelerating development of innovative technologies through digital technology\n\nWorking styles have undergone significant changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Just as teleworking reduced temporal and distance related restrictions on work, it is also making routine tasks, primarily, more efficient. We therefore believe it will continue to remain entrenched to some degree. From the perspective of communication, however, we have also discovered limits to its potential. Although we have increased the rate of teleworking across the Group as a means of addressing COVID-19, we will closely\n\ninvestigate the merits and demerits of doing so as we pursue ideal working styles.\n\nAt research and development sites, the use of AI and MI (materials informatics) has enhanced productivity.  Meanwhile,  production  sites  also now employ big data analysis and have gained the ability to discover those signs of problems that were only recognizable by skilled workers in the past. Yet, AI and MI do not produce anything from scratch. Despite being able to discover signs of problems at an early stage, without knowledge of the workplace itself these discoveries will not rapidly lead to solutions. Even now that we are faced with restrictions on going to workplaces in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I still say that all solutions can ultimately be found in the Genba (workplace). True digital transformation (DX) relies on the skillful use of digital tools to further increase the level of work, but only when based on an understanding of telework, as well as the rules and principles of the workplace.\n\n## Putting 'People-centric Management' into practice globally\n\nToray has passed down a culture of 'people-centric management' since our founding. Likewise,\n\nwe recognize human resources as an important asset that is not listed on the balance sheet, and that fostering people directly connects to corporate value. This set of values befitting of a Japanese corporation is also accepted by Group companies outside of Japan.\n\nIn the U.S.A., where short-term results are prioritized, where there is a deep-rooted belief that labor costs are variable rather than fixed, and where labor turnover is severe, Toray Plastics (America), Inc., has truly embodied Toray's approach to 'people-centric management.'

This in turn allows the Board to fully deliberate on important issues from a wide range of viewpoints starting from the investigation stage prior to pass-\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, it seized upon the shift to longer food shelf-life and enhanced production capacity for packaging films to adhere to sustainable growth. When it operated as a manufacturer of video tape films in the past, the crushing wave of digitalization even brought it to the precipice of life or death as a company at one point. Even so, it did not consider downsizing and instead successfully turned this crisis into an opportunity by pioneering the window glass protection film market using its technologies. It later made another strategic shift in target applications, maintains a low turnover rate, and has put 'people-centric management' into practice, despite being a company based in the U.S.A. As such, it has since emerged as a group member of which we are very proud.\n\n## Enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, we also revised our governance  structure.  The  Board  of  Directors  must evaluate the various risks that encompass our businesses  from  multiple  standpoints  in  order to fulfill its oversight and decision-making roles. Specifically,  we  believe  it  is  important  for  the Board to fulfill its oversight function by discussing beforehand the general direction of the Company, for example our approach to the long-term vision, large-scale capital investments,  and  M&As, among others, and by verifying the execution status of major initiatives.\n\nAs  part  of  our  reforms  to  the  governance structure for fulfilling these oversight responsibilities,  we  appointed  eight  executive  officers with responsibility for the major businesses and\n\ning down resolutions, which helps lead to rapid decision-making.\n\n## Social contributions through the creation of new value\n\nIn  May  2020,  we  organized  the  'Toray-style Management' passed down since our founding, and announced the 'Toray Philosophy' with our corporate philosophy of 'Contributing to society through the creation of new value with innovative ideas, technologies and products' at its top position. In order for each employee to realize contributions to society through the creation of new value as part of their respective jobs, we hold deep conversations at each group company and site, and repeatedly hold direct dialogue between executives and employees. In this way, we seek to maximize the value the Group delivers to society.\n\nIn part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are currently in a state of global political, economic, and social chaos. Even so, Toray Group remains committed  to  providing  fundamental  solutions to global-scale problems through the creation of innovative technologies and advanced materials, and is determined to fulfill our increasingly important roles as a corporate entity worthy of society's respect. For this reason, we ask that all of our stakeholders grant us their continued understanding and support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Akihiro Nikkaku\n\nPresident Toray Industries, Inc.",

The large-scale themes include lightweight materials, biomass-derived materials, recycled materials, lithium-ion battery separator films, large tow carbon fibers for wind turbine blade applications, water treatment membranes, and hydrogen- and fuel cell-related materials. In fiscal 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy-saving field that includes carbon fibers for aircraft remained sluggish, and the revenue of the GR business decreased 13.2% from the previous fiscal year to \u00a5 711.8 billion . However, revenue from carbon fibers for wind turbine blades, recycling and new energy fields remains strong, and the gross profit margin of the GR business is higher than the group average.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Toray developed and began mass production  of advanced-grade  TORAYFAN TM ,  a highly thermal- and voltage-resistant, biaxially oriented polypropylene (OPP) film for use in capacitors for electric vehicles (xEVs).\n\nIn the water treatment membrane business, the hollow fiber membrane-type ultrafiltration (UF) membrane HFUG-2020AN, which features the largest membrane surface area in the world , was selected for use in a large-scale wastewater treatment facility located in Wuxi, China, the full-scale operation of which began in June 2020. On sale since 2019, this UF membrane has been highly evaluated for its superior operational stability and economic performance due to its compact offering, and its adoption has been expanded to a variety of applications, such as water purification, industrial water purification, and industrial wastewater recycling. To date, this membrane has been adopted in nine countries around the world.\n\nIn addition, with Spain's SP Group, Toray succeeded  in  demonstrating  the  world's  first 100% VOC-free waterless, electron beam (EB) offset printing technology in the field of flexible packaging printing.",

Moreover, by providing solutions that are unique to the Group-thanks to its expertise in materials-to  a  variety  of  health-related  social issues, the Group aims to boost revenue in the LI business to \u00a5 300 billion in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2020, shipments of nonwoven fabrics for medical gowns and masks increased, and the addition of the 'personal safety' area resulted in an increase in revenue of 23.5% compared with the previous fiscal year to \u00a5 275.6 billion . The gross profit margin is also higher than the group average.\n\nIn  fiscal  2020,  Toray  Group  contributed  to the  prevention  of  the  spread  and  the  treatment  of  COVID-19  infections  by  providing TORAYMYXIN TM extracorporeal  hemoperfusion cartridge , single-use medical gowns , and nonwoven fabrics for masks . Based on requests from the Japanese government, the Group has put in place a domestic production system for medical gowns that can reliably deliver the required quantity to medical professionals in a short period of time. For nonwoven fabrics for masks, the Group made full use of its global production facilities and established a supply system five times the size of that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDeveloped as a new concept antibody drug that can be expected to be effective in many types  of  cancer, TRK-950 has  been  administered to more than 100 patients since the start of Phase I clinical trials which began in March 2017, in the U.S.A. and France. Toray has received no reports of safety issues to date*.\n\n* Not the final result\n\nMeanwhile, as a business development of the functional material hitoe TM , Toray has commercialized-in collaboration with NTT TechnoCross Corporation and Goldwin Inc.-a shirt-type sensor that can simultaneously measure heart rate, temperature, and humidity as part of a 'heat countermeasure service' that detects signs of poor physical condition in hot environments.",

        "page_content": "## New Business Creation\n\nTo  generate  sources  of  earnings  for  the  next growth stage under AP-G 2022, several largescale themes were selected that can be expected to lead to the creation of one business domain in the 2020s and promoted under the Future\n\n## TORAY-2020s Project (FT Project) .\n\nSpecifically, the aim is to create new businesses and form a large-scale business domain by accelerating development and business model construction concerning themes geared toward the resolving of global environmental issues and realizing a safe, secure, healthy and long-lived society. These themes include: hydrogen- and fuel  cell-related  materials;  biomass  utilization products and processing technologies; environmentally-friendly printing solutions; hygiene and health-care products; and sensing device-related materials.\n\nFor example, in biomass utilization products and  processing  technologies,  the  Company  is developing  applications  for  products  obtained from a demonstration plant that produces cellulosic sugar from the surplus bagasse generated at  a  sugar  refinery.  In  environmentally-friendly printing solutions, Toray succeeded in giving a practical demonstration of 100% VOC-free waterless electron beam (EB) offset printing technology in the field of flexible packaging printing, a world first, and have launched a dedicated printing plate.\n\n## Basic Strategy Strengthening Competitiveness 2\n\nTo strengthen competitiveness, the Group is working on three priority issues: total cost reduction; business advancement and high added-value creation; and enhancing workplace competency in sales & marketing and production.\n\nFor total cost reduction, Total Cost Reduction Project (NTC Project) is promoted across the Group, and the target is to reduce \u00a5 150 billion over a three-year period through activities to reduce variable and fixed costs and bring about  innovation  in  production  processes.  In this regard, in fiscal 2020, variable costs were reduced  by  \u00a5 32.4 billion,  fixed  costs  by \u00a5 31.7 billion, and production process innovations reduced costs by \u00a5 3.3 billion, for a total  reduction  of  \u00a5 67.4 billion  (progress rate of 45%) .\n\nAs for business advancement and high added-value creation , the Group is working not only to achieve advancement in products but also to add high value by integrating and combining products and services, to create new value through alliances, and to pursue innovation in the value chain by utilizing Information and Communication Technology (ICT). To enhance workplace competency  in  sales  &  marketing  and  production , the Group is devising ways to strengthen the  global  supply  chain,  especially  for  growth markets. To give an example, for the fibers, textiles, and garments for apparel-use, with regard to the 'integrated business from fibers and textiles to garments' supply chain which is based on  applications  and  end-customer  needs,  the Group is working on strengthening the supply chain  in  China,  extending  the  supply  chain  in ASEAN countries, and establishing supply chains in South Asia, centered on India.",

        "page_content": "## Basic Strategy Strengthening the Management Foundation 3\n\nIn strengthening the management foundation, two themes are promoted: strengthening the financial structure by improving cash efficiency; and the business structure reform of low-growth and low-profitability businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith regard to strengthening the financial structure by improving cash efficiency , business operations will be carried out with a stronger awareness of cash flow, which is the certainty of a return on investment, toward 'sound, sustainable growth.' Excluding M&A, the target is to generate more than \u00a5 120 billion in free cash flow during the period covered by AP-G 2022. In fiscal 2020, the business environment was harsh due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but free cash flow expanded to \u00a5 113.7 billion . In addition, the D/E ratio was 0.79 , which was below the guideline set at around 0.8.\n\nIn the case of the business structure reform of low-growth and low-profitability businesses, structural reform of the polyester/cotton blended textile (T/C) business is underway in the fibers and textiles business. Specifically, in response to the irreversible decrease in demand for business shirts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision to close the spin-\n\nning mills of Penfabric Sdn. Berhad was taken in June 2020. In light of this situation, cooperation within the Group is further strengthened, in areas such as the supply of greige (textiles before dyeing and post-processing), and expansion into areas such as workwear, casual wear, and anti-epidemic applications are also promoted. In addition, in the domestic textile subsidiaries, Toray Group is working as one to reform the business structure centered on withdrawing from low-profitability businesses and shifting to highly profitable businesses in response to the gradual decline in domestic textile demand. Based on plans to cut aircraft production that were triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, a carbon fiber composite materials subsidiary in the U.S.A. optimized its workforce and recorded impairment losses, while the surplus equipment of the Group are being used for production of carbon fiber for other applications.\n\n## Sustainability Targets\n\n## Initiatives for Sustainability\n\nWith regard to sustainability targets, the growth in the revenue of the GR business has temporarily slowed down due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the revenue of the LI business is steadily increasing . In addition, the avoided CO2 emissions and the contributed annual water filtration throughput are steadily expanding . In addition to promoting the recycling of raw materials, biotechnology, the utilization of renewable energy, and the reuse of water resources, Toray is aiming to realize a circular economy by contributing to the development of hydrogen production (water electrolysis), hydrogen infrastructure (compression and storage), and hydrogen utilization (fuel cell) technologies that enable carbon neutrality. This will be achieved through the development, manufacture and sale of materials for water electrolysis, hydrogen compression, and fuel cells, such as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and electrode base materials.\n\n|                                                                      | FY 2013 Actual (baseline year) (J-GAAP)   | FY 2020 Actual (compared with FY 2013) (IFRS)     | FY 2022 Target (compared with FY 2013) (IFRS)   | FY 2030 Target (compared with FY 2013) (IFRS)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| GR Net sales / Revenue                                               | 463.1  billion yen                        | 711.8  billion yen (1.5 fold)                     | 1,000.0  billion yen (2.2 fold)                 | 4  fold                                         |\n| LI Net sales / Revenue                                               | 119.6  billion yen                        | 275.6  billion yen (2.3 fold)                     | 300.0  billion yen (2.5 fold)                   | 6  fold                                         |\n| Avoided CO2 emissions                                                | 38.4  million tons                        | 6.4  fold                                         | 5.3  fold                                       | 8  fold                                         |\n| Contributed Annual water filtration  throughput                      | 27.23  million tons/day                   | 2.0  fold                                         | 2.4  fold                                       | 3  fold                                         |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions per unit  of sales in production activities | 3.37  thousand tons/billion yen           | 2.90  thousand  tons/billion yen (14% reduction)  | 20 % reduction                                  | 30 % reduction                                  |\n| Water consumption per unit of sales  in production activities        | 152  thousand tons/billion yen            | 125.2  thousand  tons/billion yen (18% reduction) | 25 % reduction                                  | 30 % reduction                                  |\n\n23",

On the other hand, to  strengthen  its  financial  structure, the Company aims to generate more than \u00a5 120 billion in free cash flow over a three-year period and has set an even stricter D/E ratio guideline of around 0.8 to enhance its financial discipline.\n\n## Working Capital and CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInventories (left) CCC (right) Net receivables and payables (left)\n\n## Measures to Strengthen Financial Structure\n\n## 1. Enhance Cash Flow Management\n\nIn order to improve cash flow company-wide, the Company introduced a system to manage free cash flow for each division in fiscal 2020, in which each division autonomously manages cash inflows from revenue and core operating income as well as cash outflows for capital expenditures and changes in working capital such as inventories. In addition, the Company continues to implement the '3C-i (Cash Conversion Cycle Improvement) Activity' in order to\n\nreduce working capital .\n\n## 2. Increase Certainty of Return on Capital Investment\n\nToray  engages  in  economic  evaluation  of  capital investment plans by setting and checking investment profitability standards (hurdle rates) able to reach  ROA  and  ROE  targets.  After  the  projects are  implemented,  the  Company  conducts  regular follow-ups, and it discusses how to make up for underperforming projects and then implements countermeasures.\n\nIn addition, Toray has reviewed its capital investment management and operation methods since fiscal 2020 based on an analysis that the main reasons why past capital investments have not generated returns as planned were the occurrence of unexpected risks and not sufficiently responding to the risks that actually materialized. The Company identifies risks from every angle, starting from the",

Business Structure Reform of Low-Growth, Low-Profitability Businesses\n\nTo improve company-wide profitability and capital efficiency, Toray has introduced return on invested capital (ROIC) as a profitability indicator for screening low-growth and low-profitability businesses. The Company calculates ROIC for each business and product, and for businesses\n\nand products where ROIC is below the cost of capital and growth potential is low, the Executive Committee discusses  how  to  improve  profitability and growth potential through restructuring and implements measures to restore the original profitability of the business.\n\nInterest-bearing Liabilities, Owner's Equity and Debt/equity Ratio (D/E Ratio)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cash Flows and Balance Sheets\n\nFree cash flow for fiscal 2020 was \u00a5113.7 billion  (up  \u00a518.3  billion  year-on-year),  securing  a high level of cash flow. Although core operating  income  decreased  to  \u00a590.3  billion  (down \u00a535.3 billion year-on-year), cash flows provided by  operating  activities  came  to  \u00a5211.6  billion (down \u00a526.7 billion year-on-year) due to efforts to strengthen  working  capital  management through 3C-i activities. In addition, net cash used in investing activities amounted to \u00a597.9 billion (a decrease of \u00a545.0 billion year-on-year), since while Toray made the necessary capital investments for growth based on strict project selection, it sold assets no longer worth holding. For fiscal 2021, Toray expects to maintain positive free cash flow by working to increase core operating income and thoroughly managing working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nThe D/E  ratio for  fiscal  2020  was  0.79,  a decrease of 0.10 from the previous fiscal year due to an increase in owner's equity and a decrease in interest-bearing liabilities, which is in line with the guideline of around 0.8.\n\n## Shareholder Returns\n\nToray considers the appropriate distribution of profits to shareholders to be an important management issue, and its basic policy is to pay appropriate dividends by comprehensively taking into account business earnings trends, financial structure, and the securing of retained earnings necessary for future growth. Under AP-G 2022, Toray aims to continuously hike dividends, targeting a dividend payout ratio of about 30%.\n\n25",

Kennedy, the U.S.A.  promoted  a  desalination  project  using Reverse Osmosis membranes (RO membranes) as  a  national  project,  and  developed  Cellulose Acetate membranes (CA membranes).\n\nToray  began  research  on  RO  membranes  in 1968  and  has  been  developing  RO  membrane technologies, expanding its business for over 50 years, and introducing numerous RO membranes to the world.\n\n## Basic research, establishment of fundamental technologies and start of production\n\nThe history of Toray's RO membrane business can be divided into two periods: the emergence period from the start of research until around 2000, and the global business expansion period after 2006.\n\nIn the emergence period, Toray conducted R&D of membrane itself and developed manufacturing technologies, such as the assembly of membrane elements . In 1980, Toray started CA membrane production in Shiga, Japan, and in 1985, a fullscale RO production plant for polyamide composite membranes was completed in Ehime, Japan.\n\nWith the completion of the Ehime Plant, RO membranes for brackish water desalination were commercialized and sales were started.\n\nAlthough CA membranes had been shipped for the original purpose of seawater desalination for small seawater desalination systems for remote islands in Japan, the demand was still small. The market for brackish desalination and wastewater treatment had not yet grown sufficiently, and the business situation remained severe.\n\n## Continuation of business with RO membranes for ultra-pure water production process and start of the seawater desalination business\n\nIn  the  1980s,  the  semiconductor  industry  had grown into a huge market, leading the growth of the Japanese industrial sector, and RO membranes were used for the production of ultra-pure water used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nHowever, as the semiconductor manufacturing hub shifted to the Republic of Korea and China, Toray decided on full-scale entry to the seawater desalination membrane, which was its original intention.\n\nIn 1991, Toray commercialized polyamide composite membranes for seawater desalination and received an order for membranes for the Okinawa seawater desalination Plant (40,000 m 3 /day), the largest plant in Japan at the time. However, the demand for seawater desalination were small in Japan, where water was basically in plenty, and Toray decided to enter the overseas market in earnest.",

(TMA) was established as a joint venture with IONICS (an engineering company that was later acquired by GE) in the U.S.A., which was the world's largest RO membrane market at the time. TMA began producing  RO  elements  by  importing  seawater desalination RO membranes produced in Ehime and started sales of those elements. TMA supplied membranes to the Trinidad and Tobago Seawater Desalination Plant which was the biggest in the western  hemisphere  in  2002,  and  the  Sulaibia Wastewater Treatment Plant in Kuwait which was the largest in the world, in 2005. Later, TMA was dissolved and Toray Membrane USA, Inc. (TMUS) was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Toray. From TMUS, Toray Group established production,  sales  and  Marketig,  and  development bases in various regions around the world, and during this time, Toray formed the basic concept for expanding its water treatment business. Specifically,\n\n- \u00b7  The quality of the feed water for water treatment (seawater, river water, etc.) differs from country to country and region to region, and the requirements for water treatment also differ. In order to\n\ngrasp the needs of customers accurately, local sales representatives who are familiar with the local situation are necessary.\n\n- \u00b7  In many cases, global giant water business companies  and  construction  companies  execute water treatment projects of large-scale seawater desalination in the world, so in order to respond to global business schemes such as borderless inquiries  and  procurement,  it  is  necessary  to have sales offices around the world and a global coordination system for each office.\n- \u00b7  In addition, in order to reflect market trends and customer needs in products and services, it is necessary to have local development, production, and sales bases.\n\nBased on this principle the GST was organized by inviting the finest people in the water treatment industry to each sales base as managers and hiring people with local sales experience.\n\nThe decision to make a full entry into the global market and the establishment of the GST system enabled Toray to directly grasp the actual situation of the market and customers, and it became a source of accelerating the creation of new value for the Company, which had previously conducted sales and marketing in overseas only through trading companies or distributors.\n\nInterview\n\n## The reason for the establishment of TMUS and the situation at the time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tatsuya Tamura, General Manager of RO Membrane Product Dept. (MC)\n\nIn this discussion, we have Mr. Steven Cappos  and  Mr.  Kwak  Soon-chul,  who  have been with us since the beginning of the GST. First, we would like to hear from Mr. Cappos, who was the plant manager when TMUS was established in 2006 and is currently the president of TMUS, about the situation at the time of the company's launch and the key points of sales in the Americas since then.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steven Cappos, President of TMUS\n\nWhen TMUS was established, experts of the RO membrane industry not only from the U.S.A. but also from around the world gathered. All of them knew the characteristics of the RO market in the U.S.A. and the needs of customers, and due to their experience, they were able to move around the U.S.A. to contribute to the sales expansion of TMUS.

For example, we have captured the needs of membranes for boiler pure water for industrial use, and for food industry and drinking water, and utilized them in the development of TMUS's own products. In addition, the market for brackish RO membranes for industrial water is quite large in the U.S.A., and we formulated a business strategy for brackish RO that is different from that for large-scale seawater projects, and we have been constantly  competing  with  large-scale  competitors. Since the early stage of the launch of GST, we have accurately grasped the market information and have taken several measures, which have led to our current business expansion.\n\n## Sales by GST: Winning the Shuaibah project\n\nMC One of the purposes of forming the GST was to win large projects through global collaboration. I would like to ask Mr. Kwak, who was mainly in charge of winning large seawater projects, about the situation and strategy at that time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kwak-Soon Chul, President of Toray Asia Pte. Ltd. (TAS)\n\nIn those days, I was mainly in charge of acquiring orders of large-scale projects. Since Toray was a new player in the RO membrane market for large-scale projects at the time, our primary target was emerging engineering companies that did not have strong relation to existing membrane manufacturers. One of the first successful examples of a large-scale project was the Shuaibah project in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).\n\nIn this project, concerned parties were scattered around the world, as the operating company and the commission company were located in KSA, the investor was in KSA, the plant construction company was in the Republic of Korea, the plant design company was in the U.S.A., and the consultant was in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In order to deal with this, each party worked together to negotiate and win the order. For example, TMUS handled the U.S.A., Toray HQ handled Republic of Korea, and TMEu handled KSA and Dubai in UAE. Since we were able to negotiate closely in each region, we were\n\nable to conduct sales activities by grasping the needs of customers in each area.\n\n## Entering the Singapore Market\n\nMC Mr. Kwak, after winning the Shuaibah project, you moved to Singapore as the President of  TAS  in  2008,  and  now  you  are  the  GST Chairman. Could you tell us about the status of project acquisition in Singapore at the time?\n\nKwak Singapore is an island nation where water is limited, and it depends on Malaysia for most of its water supply, so securing water is important for its national security. For this reason, Singapore has been actively promoting seawater desalination and reuse of wastewater (NEWater), in order to promote self-sufficiency of water resources. Since around 2006, GST has been working to win orders for RO membranes for large-scale plants to be constructed in Singapore, which we have targeted as our most important region for the RO membrane business. At that time, Singapore was aiming to become a global water technology hub and was trying to research and incorporate water treatment technologies from around the world, so we collaborated with a local university and established  Toray  Singapore  Water  Research  Center (TSWRC) as a new water treatment research base for the Group. We also developed sales activities to win orders for large-scale projects by utilizing the GST network around the world, and the knowledge we gained from winning the Shuaibah project was very useful.\n\n## Entering the Chinese market, establishing JV\n\nMC In China, which is currently the world's largest market for RO membranes, Toray BlueStar Membrane Co., Ltd. (TBMC) was established as a joint venture with ChemChina in 2009, and started production and sales activities in 2010. Mr. Gao, who has been a GST member since TBMC's  establishment,  as  well  as  Chairman and President of Toray Industries (China) Co., Ltd., will talk about the situation at the time of TBMC's establishment and its subsequent sales activities.",

Unless you understand them well, you cannot capture the needs of local market and customers. When TBMC was established, sales leader with foreign nationality started to develop the Chinese market, but couldn't achieve satisfactory results because the person did not understand the market characteristics. In 2015, I was entrusted as the leader of the sales team. Based on the management up until that point, we gradually expanded our business by conducting sales and technical service activities by the Chinese peo-\n\nple who were very familiar with the Chinese culture and market, and who have a good network of contacts, thus gaining the trust of customers.\n\n## Sales Volume of Toray RO Membranes Based on Cumulative Water Production Rate and History of Expansion of the Water Treatment Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCumulative water supply of 91,400,000 m 3 /day: equivalent to 8% of the world's population, or 640 million people (as of March 31, 2021)\n\n## Value Creation Process 2 DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS\n\n## Interview\n\n## Development of high boron removal membrane for seawater desalination\n\nMC By interacting directly with customers, GST has been able to accurately capture the different needs of each country, region and customer, and based on this information, R&D and technical departments have been able to develop new products, and in particular, there have been many cases of dramatic improvements in technology and product value. Mr. Cappos, could you give us examples of this?\n\nCappos I would like to mention the development of technology to improve boron removal performance.\n\nIn  2006,  in  accordance  with  WHO's  Boron Guidelines, the tightening of its regulation value had a major impact on the operation and management of water utilities around the world and on the designs of plant manufacturers. In addition, the actual boron concentration  setting  values  are  determined  by each country where the plant is installed, and the required removal performance varies from country\n\nto country. In order to respond to these changes, it was important for the GST to work closely with each region, government and users. The GST shared this information, as well as information on the market trends of each country and region, and collaborated with HQ to set targets for membrane development and consider how to respond to each project.\n\nMC Due to tightening boron regulations, improvement of boron removal performance was required, and the technical department was subjected to quite challenging demands at the time. Let's hear about the difficulties from the General Manager of the Global Environment Research Laboratory and the General Manager of the membrane technical department, who were in charge of technological development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKozo Takahashi, General Manager of Global Environment Research Laboratories The performance requirements for RO",

Since the water produced by newly constructed desalination plants must comply with these regulations (0.5~1.0 ppm or below), higher boron removal performance was required for RO membranes.\n\nSince boron has a small atomic diameter, RO membranes, which are based on filtration separation by size, are required to have smaller and uniform pore size. In order to develop such a new RO membrane, it is necessary to measure the pore size of the membrane, but there was no way to measure the pore size of organic matter at the sub-nanometer level.\n\nTherefore, in collaboration with Toray Research Center (TRC), a subsidiary of Toray that has one of the world's leading analytical technologies, we investigated a method to measure the pore size distribution  of  RO  membranes  using  Positron Annihilation  Lifetime  Spectroscopy  (PALS),  and developed a technology to measure the membrane pore size (the size of the pores in the membrane) at the nanometer level. The measurement results were correlated with the boron removal rate, and the required pore size of the RO membrane was determined, and finally a high boron removal RO membrane was obtained on a bench scale.\n\nCorrelation between Boron Removal Ratio and Pore Diameter * of Membrane\n\n100\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Pore size is measured by PALS (Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Takao Sasaki, General Manager of Membrane Technical Department\n\nSpecifications of final products are defined and mass production technology is established at the Membrane Technical Department. The specifications for the high boron removal membrane were clarified at the Global Environment Research Laboratories,  and  the  target  RO  membrane  was obtained on a bench scale. Taking over this technology, the Membrane Technical Department started to study the production conditions for the actual production machine. In order to control the pore size and obtain uniformity of membranes, we analyzed the factors of membrane production conditions, and after repeated prototyping and evaluation, we finally developed the target product. We followed up on the operation of the prototype RO membrane in an actual plant, confirmed its initial performance stability and durability, and launched it as a new product.\n\nMC The technology obtained through this development was not only for the development of high boron removal RO membranes, but also for the uniformity of pore size control of the entire RO membrane, which greatly improved our subsequent research and new product development capabilities.  This  has  been  the  driving  force behind the expansion of our global market share to more than 60% of seawater RO membranes.\n\n## Development of highly durable brackish water desalination membrane (Tough Membrane)\n\nMC The development, production, and sales of RO membranes for seawater desalination, which require state-of-the-art high performance, has been the concept since the start of the business, but the demand for large-scale seawater desalination plant construction fluctuates greatly from year to year depending on the global economic situation. In order to realize a stable expansion of business, it was necessary to focus on the area of RO membranes for brackish water applications, where the market is large and the needs are stable. The market share of brackish RO membranes has expanded to the point where it is now competing for the top share in the world market, but please tell us about the events that triggered this expansion, Mr. Gao.",

The customer's plant experienced a number of troubles that caused the water quality to drop within a relatively short period of time after the start of operation. We investigated the plant, but couldn't find the cause. The HQ investigation concluded that it was probably an operational error where chlorine came into contact with the RO membrane during operation. We replaced elements, but the situation did not improve, and rumors spread that Toray RO was not durable enough, and TBMC was facing a critical situation. So we asked HQ to conduct a thorough investigation again.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Masahide Taniguchi, General Manager of  Water Treatment  Technical Department\n\nAt the time, brackish RO membranes were  sold  all  over  the  world.  We  obtained  the degraded RO membranes from the customer and investigated them. As a result, we found that the degradation of performance was due to oxidation of the membrane surface, and we thought that the oxidation was caused by chlorine contact due to operational errors by the operator.\n\nIn response to repeated requests for investigation from TBMC, we dispatched a technical service team from HQ to the customer in China. As a result of thorough investigation, including parallel operation with another company's RO membranes, we found that there was an issue with our membranes when chemical cleaning method was used. This cleaning method, at the time, was becoming mainstream in China.\n\nTBMC immediately asked the customers who were experiencing problems to improve their chemical cleaning methods and started development at the Global Environment Research Laboratory to enhance the durability of the membrane against chemicals.\n\nTakahashi We  started  development  to  enhance the chemical durabilities (oxidation tolerance) of brackish RO membranes by establishing a proj-\n\nect  structure  with  sales  and  marketing,  technical, and research departments becoming as one. Membrane performance is affected by the minor constituents in the raw water, so in order to determine the durability of the membrane, we repeatedly conducted  durability  tests  using  various  prototype membranes with different formulations and using Chinese water at Toray Advanced Materials Research Laboratories (China) Co., Ltd. (TARC), our research base in China. As a result of promoting the development of highly durable RO membranes as a project team, we were able to develop a brackish RO membrane that is more durable than competitors and launch it into the market.\n\nSasaki These  internal  relevant  departments  analyzed the phenomenon, researched new products, and  improved  operational  technology,  while  the Membrane Technical Department established manufacturing technology of new products.\n\nGao By quickly reporting requests from users to the  R&D  team,  conducting  joint  evaluation  and cause  investigation  by  the  Global  Environment Research  Laboratories  and  TARC,  and  developing technology to enhance durability based on the findings, we were able to develop a brackish RO membrane with strong chemical durability that surpassed that of competitors. We named this product 'Tough Membrane' and launched it, which rapidly expanded sales and led to a large increase in market share in China.\n\nCappos The  sales  volume  of  Tough  Membranes greatly expanded not only in China where performance of RO membrane easily deteriorated, but also in the U.S.A. and Europe, where there were no occurrences of such deterioration, and they grew to become a representative product of Toray Brackish RO membranes. In addition, Toray developed and launched a series of new products (Tough Series) that added new values to Tough Membrane, such as high productivity, energy saving, and low fouling, and became a driving force for Toray to compete for the world's top share in brackish RO.\n\nKwak The  GST  learned  a  lot  from  the  development of the Tough Membrane as well.

We came to realize through this case is the fact that customers don't say anything does not mean they are satisfied, but they just think this product is the way it is. By materializing such hidden problems and needs, we were able to improve customer satisfaction. I recognized that it is very important for GST and technical service teams to work together to uncover the hidden needs of customers.\n\nMC GST receives a complaint, and the technical service team conducts various investigations and tests at the customer's plant to determine the cause of the performance degradation problem, which is then passed on to R&D. Then, in the process of evaluating and analyzing the developed membrane at the customer's plant in collaboration with GST, the customer and the technical service team, we gained the customer's trust by responding to various information and questions from the customer, and as a result, though it looks troublesome at a glance, we were able to smoothly proceed with the development of the Tough Membrane.\n\nTaniguchi In  order  improve  customer  satisfaction with GST members at each base, currently, we have placed technical service teams at GST locations  around  the  world  and  organized  them  as Global Technical Service Team (GTST) under the control of HQ to strengthen our capabilities. The role of the GTST team is to design RO membranes\n\nfor large-scale seawater desalination  projects and reuse  of  sewage  wastewater,  start-up  and  support operation of plant, investigate the causes of customer  complaints  and  defects,  identify  product weaknesses and provide feedback to the R&D department, and evaluate the performance of new products. Regarding the RO membrane plant, in particular, as our business expands, the number of new requests including energy conservation, complaints and requests for cooperation from customers has also increased. Our company develops and sells high-performance  membrane  products,  but    we believe that it is important to get deeply involved with our customers in terms of usage rules and operational technology to let them handle the product perfectly. By cooperating and communicating with our customers, we can understand their true needs that even they are not aware of, and give an advice and make a proposal to them. Reflecting the knowledge acquired in new development themes, and 'create new value' in cooperation with our customers. Taking advantage of GTST which is the strong point of our water treatment business, I would like to further strengthen such an initiative.\n\n## About the value chain in the company\n\nMC In terms of value creation in the RO business, which is the main objective of the roundtable discussion, Toray Group's value chain has also made a significant contribution.

In addition, TRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toray, possesses one of the world's leading analytical facilities and technologies, which are essential for analyzing the used products, as well as for developing new products and technologies that pursue the ultimate limits of recent years.\n\nAnd for RO production facilities, the Engineering Division, a group of professionals in equipment development and design, works together with the technology development department of the Water Treatment Division to develop, design, construct, and maintain the facilities. The engineering department contributes to the realization of highly competitive production facilities that include not only product performance and production capacity, but also ease of operation and maintainability of the facilities.\n\nSasaki Functional polymer is used as a base material for RO membranes, and it helps to maintain the strength and durability of RO membranes and RO elements. When RO membranes were first developed in the U.S.A., taffeta, which is used for yacht sails, was used as the base material, but today, staple nonwoven fabrics (paper-formed nonwoven fabrics) are the mainstream.\n\nAs a manufacturer of fibers and textiles materials, Toray supplied fibers used as raw materials for taffeta and nonwoven fabrics, but in order to meet the needs for enhanced pressure resistance due to the high-pressure operation of RO membranes in the desalination of high-temperature, high-concentration seawater in the Middle East, Toray worked on the development of base materials.\n\nThe key point in developing the technology to use the filament nonwoven fabric AXTER TM , which is overwhelmingly superior in terms of strength and cost to the staple nonwoven fabric that is the industry standard, was the technology to equalize the thickness across the entire membrane surface (longitudinal and width directions) so that the chemical solution applied on the substrate would not leak. Toray's technology development departments of fibers and textiles and nonwoven fabrics, the  Global  Environment  Research  Laboratories,\n\nand  the  Membrane  Technology  Department worked together to develop AXTER TM , a filament nonwoven fabric that can be used as a base material for RO membranes, through repeated facility modifications and trial evaluations, and were able to significantly strengthen the competitiveness of seawater RO membranes.\n\nMC Toray's sales organization (GST), which grasps information  on  markets  and  customers  and responds closely to them, and its technical service organization (GTST), which digs deeper into the activities of the GST from a technical perspective and identifies essential issues, have been creating new value by analyzing issues that have been obtained and by the technology development department, which creates new technologies and products, in cooperation with the internal value chain.\n\nThanks to the accumulation of such value creation, sales of RO membranes have expanded steadily, and in recent years, with the successive acquisition of large-scale seawater projects by Toray Membrane Middle East LLC (TMME) in the Middle East region, we have acquired a global market share of more than 60% for seawater RO membranes, and have expanded our business to compete for the top share in the world for brackish RO membranes.\n\nLet's further strengthen these efforts and continue to create new value, aiming to ensure world's top share in RO during the current Medium-Term Management Program, AP-G 2022, as well as exceed 50% of world's market share which is the target of the Long-Term Corporate Vision, VISION 2030, so that we can realize our determination of 'providing safe, secure, and affordable water to people suffering from water shortages around the world' at a higher level.\n\nSales of RO Element for Industrial Use (FY 2013 is set to an index of 100 \uff09\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## TCFD INITIATIVES\n\n## Impact Analysis of Climate Change\n\nUpon announcing its support for the TCFD recommendations in May 2019, Toray Group took the opportunity to identify opportunities and risks related to climate change, which are both difficult to predict and uncertain. To determine how the opportunities and risks could impact Toray Group, a scenario analysis was conducted as per the TCFD recommendations.\n\nThe Paris Agreement target is to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Looking to help achieve this target and build a decarbonized society, Toray Group primarily analyzed the 1.5\u00b0C increase scenario, but also considered the 2\u00b0C increase scenario.\n\nThe Group also looked at the 4\u00b0C increase scenario  assuming  insufficient  progress  on  efforts  to ameliorate global climate change.\n\nThe Toray Group Sustainability Vision outlines the KPIs for fiscal 2030 as interim targets toward the world it envisions for 2050. Accordingly, the scenario analysis covered the period from 2030 to 2050. Toray Group also broadly summarized the impacts of climate change on the Group and conducted analysis emphasizing markets that are thought to have a particularly significant impact on the Group. These markets are synthetic fibers for apparel, electric vehicles, aircraft, wind power generation, lithium-ion batteries, next-generation batteries, fuel cells, and water treatment.\n\n## Results of Opportunity Analysis\n\nThere are significant opportunities for businesses that\n\nmitigate climate change, focusing on GR businesses. There is a possibility that the business opportunities will increase as efforts to address climate change continue to advance. There are also significant business opportunities related to adapting to climate change in segments such as water treatment. While there are significant opportunities in the scenario where efforts to address climate change make insufficient progress (world with a 4\u00b0C increase), there are expected to be ample business opportunities in the scenarios where progress is made on efforts to address climate change (world with a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C increase). Furthermore, there are expected to be business opportunities for adapting to climate change in Life Innovation (LI) businesses in segments such as infectious disease protection garments.\n\n## Results of Risk Analysis\n\nFor the climate change risks, there is a particularly significant risk of carbon tax burdens and restrictions on GHG emissions. The carbon tax burden in the scenario where progress is made on efforts to address climate change was found to be around US$800 million  (equivalent  to  approximately  85  billion  yen).* Furthermore, Toray Group is engaged in a wide range of businesses worldwide and there is a possibility that some operating bases will be significantly impacted by water intake restrictions. Therefore, water usage restrictions were determined to be a significant risk.\n\n- *  Calculated by multiplying the fiscal 2019 GHG emissions (5.75 million tons-CO2) by the estimated carbon tax (US$140 per ton) under the 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios.\n\nMain opportunities, risks, and responses related to climate change (excerpts *1 ) *1 Excerpts from Toray Group TCFD Report 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Social change                                   | Main risks, opportunities   | Main risks, opportunities                                                                      | Responses by Toray Group                                                                     | Magnitude of opportunity, risk *2   | Magnitude of opportunity, risk *2   | Magnitude of opportunity, risk *2   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                 |                             |                                                                                                |                                                                                              | 1.5\u00b0C                               | 2\u00b0C                                 | 4\u00b0C                                 |\n| Increase in ratio  of renewable  energy         | Opportunities               | \u00b7  Growth of renewable energy- related business \u00b7  Growth of storage battery- related business | \u00b7 Carbon fiber for wind turbine blades \u00b7 Battery separator film GR                           | large                               |                                     |                                     |\n|                                                 | Risks                       | \u00b7 Increased electricity costs                                                                  | \u00b7 Energy conservation initiatives                                                            | large                               |                                     |                                     |\n| Establishment  and raising of  carbon taxes and | Opportunities               | \u00b7  Growth of energy  conservation-related business                                             | \u00b7 Lightweight materials \u00b7 Insulating and heat shielding products \u00b7 Functional garments GR LI | large                               |                                     |                                     |\n| GHG emissions  reduction targets                | Risks                       | \u00b7  Carbon tax burden, increased  procurement costs for fossil- based raw materials and fuels   | \u00b7 Reduce GHG emissions                                                                       | large                               |                                     |                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2  The magnitude of the impact was assessed to be large, moderate or small.

Development of these and other similar technologies is aimed at helping to achieve a circular economy and to reduce CO2 emissions as a result.\n\nIn terms  of  recycling,  Toray  developed  and released &+\u2122, a recycled fiber made from used polyester (PET) bottles as a raw material. In addition, we more recently developed a new technology to strip various types of coating materials and resins from the surface of used PET films and a new technology to remove foreign matter during each manufacturing process. Toray released Ecouse TM series of environmentally-friendly PET films made from raw materials\n\nrecovered and recycled using these technologies. In addition to reducing fossil-based raw materials and waste plastic, this series of environmentally-friendly PET films is expected to decrease CO2 emissions by up to 50% compared to existing products.\n\nAlong  with  developing  materials  made  from plant-derived  raw  materials  and  applying  membrane-integrated biotechnology to efficiently produce raw materials from biomass, Toray is also engaged in creating CO2 recovery technologies using gas separation membranes. Based on an all-carbon material with a two-ply structure consisting of a hollow porous carbon fiber layer and a separation layer, Toray developed a new separation membrane that combines a CO2 separation function with high durability. We envision this membrane being deployed and put into practical application for natural gas and biogas purification, as well as for hydrogen production and purification, and exhaust gas CO2 separation.\n\nContribute to initiatives including biomass plastics, recycling, promoting of enewable energy and the use of hydrogen, and water reuse\n\n<!-- image -->",

Toray conducts R&D for various materials and technologies used in each phase of hydrogen production, transport, storage, and use in an effort to help achieve a carbon-free hydrogen society.\n\nFor example, carbon paper (CP) and gas diffusion layers (GDL), both products made from Toray carbon fibers, are used in the cell stacks for the fuel cells that function as the heart of fuel cell vehicles. Similarly, high-strength carbon fibers and plastic tank liners that leverage the cutting-edge technologies Toray has accumulated in the aerospace field are incorporated into the high-pressure hydrogen tanks used to store hydrogen.\n\nThe Group's Germany-based subsidiary Greenerity is engaged in the R&D, production, and sale of the catalyst coated membranes (CCM) and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) used for fuel cells and water electrolysis. Greenerity is currently the world's largest supplier of CCM. In 2022, a second plant is scheduled to begin operations and will primarily supply CCM and MEA for the fuel cells used in commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as well as for the water electrolyzers required to produce green hydrogen, both of which are expected to see growth in demand throughout the world.\n\nIn regard to reducing the costs of green hydrogen as the greatest challenge in achieving a hydrogen society, Toray is collaborating with partner corporations in Japan and abroad to develop and demonstrate a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis technology using our proprietary hydrocarbon (HC) type PEM. As part of the 'P2G (Power-to-Gas) System  Technology  Development  Project,'  Toray worked with Hitachi Zosen Corporation to develop Japan's first megawatt class PEM water electrolyzer. This project was commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)  in  partnership  with  Yamanashi  Prefecture and Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, Inc., to\n\nproduce green hydrogen using power from renewable energy. The water electrolyzer that resulted from this project has been demonstrated to produce twice the volume of hydrogen as other technologies using conventional fluorine membranes with the same voltage area. In April 2021, the project began delivering green hydrogen to factories and super markets in Yamanashi Prefecture.\n\nHaving been selected as eligible for funding from NEDO under the Green Innovation Funding Project, in September, Toray formed the consortium Yamanashi Hydrogen  Energy  Society  (H2-YES)  with  Yamanashi Prefecture and Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, Inc., and began a project involved in energy demand conversion and usage technology development based on a large-scale P2G system. In order to further expand upon  the  achievements  of  green  hydrogen  demonstrated thus far, the Project is planning to develop and implement a large-scale 16-megawatt class PEM water electrolyzer  using  Toray's  polymer  electrolyte  membrane, as well as demonstrate the potential to convert heat demand to carbon-free options, over the five-year period from fiscal 2021 to 2025.\n\nAt the same time, in September, Toray also entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding the building  of  a  Strategic  Partnership  with  Siemens Energy  AG.  This  partnership  is  intended  to  help achieve a carbon neutral society through the creation of hydrogen technologies leveraging innovative PEM water hydrolysis. Going forward, the partnership will provide optimum solutions to customers in countries and regions around the world by leveraging the hydrogen and fuel cell related technologies and businesses owned and operated by both companies, as well as their global networks, in aims of capturing the global market, which is expected to expand dramatically. Likewise, the two companies will jointly advance the introduction and expansion of green hydrogen produced using renewable energy and the deployment of a strategic global business.\n\nPromote R&D of various products for the realization of decarbonized hydrogen society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMEA : Membrane Electrode Assembly\n\n39",

In this respect, Toray Group practices life cycle management (LCM). LCM is the basis for Green Innovation (GR) products, and the Group has adopted life cycle assessment *1 and the Toray Eco-Efficiency Analysis (T-E2A) *2 tool and is working to establish LCM as a tool to measure CO2 reduction in the entire life cycle of products and services. Those products that are able to demonstrate objective evidence of providing an effective solution for global environmental issues are certified as GR products, only after the products are subjected to a two-stage screening process by the divisional committees and the group-wide Green Innovation Certification Committee.\n\n- *1  Life cycle assessment is a method for quantitatively assessing the resources that have gone into a product and the impact the product will have on the environment and ecosystems over its life cycle.\n- *2  T-E2A is an environmental analysis tool developed by Toray Industries, Inc. It produces a map of multiple products plotted along the axes of environmental impact and economic performance, enabling users to select the most environmentally-friendly and economical products.\n\n## Fifth Medium-Term Environmental Plan Target\n\n## Environmental Accounting\n\nToray  has  been  practicing  environmental  accounting since 1999, to track investments and gauge their cost effectiveness. In fiscal 2020, the Company's environmental facility investment amounted to 1.52 billion yen , up 0.21 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Environmental preservation costs totaled 7.56 billion yen , up 0.43 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Fifth Medium-Term Environmental Plan\n\nToray  Group  implemented  its Fifth  Medium-Term Environmental Plan , which runs from fiscal 2016 to 2020. For the purpose of further reducing its environmental impact, Toray Group raised the following targets under the Toray Group Sustainability Vision in July 2018.\n\n- \u00b7 Toray Group: Achieve a 30% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue by fiscal 2030, compared with the fiscal 2013 level.\n- \u00b7 Toray Industries and plants in Japan: Achieve a 7% reduction in the absolute volume of greenhouse emissions by fiscal 2030, compared with the fiscal 2013 level.\n\nSince  fiscal  2020,  Toray  Group  has  continued  its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in aims of achieving the targets outlined in the Toray Group Sustainability  Vision.  In  regard  to  reducing  atmospheric VOC emissions and waste recycling, Toray Group is also taking action based on the numeric targets outlined in the CSR Roadmap.\n\n| Area                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Toray Group fiscal 2020 target   | Fiscal 2020 results   |                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintain greenhouse gas emissions at least 15% below the fiscal  1990 level (Toray Industries, Inc.)                                                                                                                     | 35.0% reduction 29.7% reduction  | Curb global  warming  |                                                                                 |\n| 15% or greater reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per unit of  revenue compared to fiscal 1990 (Toray Group in Japan)                                                                                                 |                                  |                       |                                                                                 |\n| Management  of chemical  substances Atmospheric emissions of PRTR Law-Specified substances:  Maintain at least 70% below the fiscal 2000 level (Toray Group) Atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): | 69.7% reduction                  |                       | Maintain at least 70% below the fiscal 2000 level (Toray Group) 73.8% reduction |\n| Zero emissions goal: Achieve at 45 or more Toray Group plants                                                                                                                                                            |                                  |                       | Achieved at 48 plants                                                           |\n| Waste  Simply disposed waste rate: 22.5% or lower (Toray Group)                                                                                                                                                          | 20.8%                            |                       |                                                                                 |\n| reduction Recycling rate: Maintain at 86% or more (Toray Group)                                                                                                                                                          | 86.2%                            |                       |                                                                                 |\n| Landfill waste rate: 1.3% or lower (Toray Group in Japan)                                                                                                                                                                | 2.4%                             |                       |                                                                                 |",

        "page_content": "## Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Initiatives\n\nToray has systematically worked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of maintaining greenhouse gas emissions at least 15% lower than the fiscal 1990 level by fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, the Company's CO2 emissions decreased by 188,000 tons-CO2 year-on-year. Greenhouse gas emissions were  down  10.9%  year-on-year  at  1.66  million tons-CO2, which was 35.0 % below the fiscal 1990 level , continuing to meet the target.\n\nToray  and  its  group  companies  in  Japan  are addressing climate change under a goal of reducing emissions by 15% on a per-unit-of-revenue basis by fiscal 2020 compared to the fiscal 1990 level. Greenhouse gas emissions for Toray and its group companies in Japan were down 10.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to the previous fiscal year. Although greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue rose by 3.1 points, emissions declined 29.7 % below the\n\nbaseline year .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, greenhouse gas emissions for Toray Group as a whole in fiscal 2020 declined 13.7% to 4.97 million tons-CO2 due to lower production volumes coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic and to the achievements of initiatives purposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On a per-unit-of-revenue basis, the Group achieved a 13.7 % reduction compared with fiscal 2013 as the baseline year established in the Sustainability Vision and CSR Roadmap 2022 . Moving forward, despite higher production volumes projected due to business growth, the Group will work to reduce per-unit energy consumption* by 2% annually at all manufacturing companies  and  plants  operated  by  Toray  Group,  and will endeavor to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the Group in an effort to achieve the reduction targets for fiscal 2030 as outlined in the Sustainability Vision.\n\n- * Energy consumption per converted production volume\n\n## Installing Renewable Energy Systems\n\nToray Group is systematically installing renewable energy systems. The Group installed a solar power\n\ngeneration system at Toray Sakai Weaving & Dyeing (Nantong)  Co.,  Ltd.,  in  fiscal  2019,  and  at  Toray Plastics Precision (Zhongshan) Ltd., in fiscal 2020. Both  systems  are  currently  in  operation.  In  addition, Toray Tokai Plant began co-combusting sludge fuel, which is carbon neutral, as boiler fuel from fiscal 2017.\n\n## Energy Conservation Measures\n\nToray is vigorously working on energy conservation activities with the goal of reducing its per-unit energy consumption  by  2%  annually.  In  fiscal  2020,  the Company's energy consumption was down 9.3 % year-on-year due mainly to a decrease in production volumes that resulted primarily from the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, its per-unit energy consumption deteriorated 4.6% as the ratio of fixed energy, which does not contribute to production, increased, due to lower production volumes.\n\n## Biodiversity Initiatives\n\nToray Group views conservation of biodiversity as a critical global environmental issue that is of equal importance to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As one of its biodiversity conservation initiatives, the Group deploys and applies a set of rules formulated in fiscal 2015 for checking impact on biodiversity to all products. In particular, the Group views palm oil as a raw material that should be followed with priority given the growing amount of interest focused on the risk of its environmental impact. Over the three-year period from fiscal 2020 to 2022, the Group will investigate whether each of its products uses certified raw materials and advance the switch to alternative materials. In fiscal 2020, the Group investigated whether certified raw materials were used in regard to raw materials  made  from  palm  oil,  and  completed  its investigation of 93% of relevant suppliers, although some suppliers did not respond. Going forward, the Group will continue to investigate those suppliers who did not respond, and determine the possibility of switching each raw material to a certified raw material, and advance this transition.\n\n41",

In order to facilitate reviews and discussions  regarding  group-wide  efforts  to promote DX, Toray established the Toray Digital Transformation  (TDX)  Promotion  Committee, chaired by the President, and under that the Technology Center DX Promotion Committee and  the  Business  Division  DX  Promotion Committee.  The  Company  is  advancing  the group-wide TDX Promotion Project in addition to conventional departmental initiatives.\n\nThe  Technology  Center  DX  Promotion Committee  streamlines  R&D  activities  by leveraging material design prior to trials, relying on simulations to shed light on the true\n\nnature of materials and informatics for predictive design. It also works to enhance quality and productivity through the utilization of AI-based automation, among other efforts.\n\nThe Business Division DX Promotion Committee  is  engaged  in  operations  with themes that can be applied horizontally, serving as leading examples across the Group, such as improving the sophistication and efficiency of global supply chain management (SCM), introduction  of  a  customer  relationship  management (CRM) system to visualize the information communicated with customers, and marketing automation (MA)-driven digital marketing.\n\nIn addition, the Information Systems Division is  working  to  build  out  IT  infrastructure  and strengthen information security in support of global business expansion.\n\n## Toray Digital Transformation (TDX) Promotion Committee\n\nTechnology Center DX Promotion Committee\n\nDrive advancement and streamlining by leveraging digital technology in research and technological development(R&D), and production\n\nBusiness Division DX Promotion Committee\n\nVisualize global management information in sales & marketing, finance & accounting, and purchasing & logistics, and advance business management\n\n## The Strengthening and Development of Digital Human Resources\n\nBased on its policy of 'improving the digital skills of personnel with a good grasp of Genba (workplace)  operations,'  the  Company's  DX program  will  immediately  train  dozens  of experts with digital expertise and at least 100 key personnel who can utilize digital technology to proactively promote business, as well as research and technological development.\n\nThese key people, being personnel engaged\n\nin research and technological development, as well as being active in on-site production activities, will be educated in digital operations, by means  including  on-the-job  training.  To  that end Toray has established in-house training programs to develop such digital personnel, and are also actively pursuing the recruitment of personnel who possess an exceptional affinity with digital initiatives.",

The results Toray achieved have been spotlighted as the cover story in a prestigious chemistry journal in the U.S.A., and following that, received the 2020 CSJ Award for Technical Development from the Chemical Society of Japan. This has also been highly evaluated academically.\n\n## Example of Informatics\n\nTo design resin materials for automobiles, Toray built a model that uses machine learning to simultaneously predict two types of characteristic values, searched for the optimal composition ratio utilizing inverse analysis, and discovered a new composition that exceeds conventional limits. The product that resulted satisfies the characteristics required by automobile manufacturers and its adoption has been finalized.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProperty value 1\n\n## Improving Production Sites (Enhancing Quality and Productivity)\n\n## Example of AI Utilization\n\nDefect detectors are used in a variety of applications, leveraging the ability to inspect products that are being transported. On the other hand, in line with the rising quality requirements of customers, it has become necessary to set stricter judgment criteria  to  prevent  non-standard  products  from drifting outside of processes. As a result, there have been cases where defects that would normally pass the testing process were determined to not meet specifications (over-detection). In the past, this was remedied by having such over-detected products be visually re-inspected to determine whether they passed or failed.\n\nAs a solution to this problem, by having AI learn the details of qualified products, it became possible to determine a pass or fail grade for over-detection while the product was being conveyed, which greatly improved efficiency. In this way, by applying AI to various product inspections, Toray can realize improved productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApplication of AI to reduce the re-inspection process and achieve significant efficiency improvements\n\n43",

        "page_content": "## Human Resources Management\n\n## Commitment to Human Rights\n\nWe at Toray Group believe respect for human rights is a mandatory management principle for ensuring the continuity of corporate activities and building positive relationships with all of the Group's stakeholders. Working to promote and raise awareness of human rights, the Group also has declared its commitment to the respect of human rights in its Corporate Guiding Principles and Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct . In the Code, discrimination of any kind based on race, creed, skin color,  gender,  religion,  nationality,  language,  physical characteristics, socioeconomic status, place of birth, or any other personal characteristics, is strictly forbidden in every process from recruiting and hiring to work placement, treatment, training, and retirement.\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct also explicitly states that sexual, maternity, and power harassment in the workplace shall not be tolerated. In addition, Toray has established a system for preventing and dealing with harassment in the workplace in its 'Guidelines for Preventing Harassment in the Workplace,' which is thoroughly conveyed to all executives and employees. The Group has also been tackling the issue of discrimination based on gender identification and sexual orientation. In January 2017, the Group established a dedicated hotline for LGBT (sexual minority) issues,\n\n## Nijiiro Consultation Service .\n\nIn addition, as a global enterprise, the Group respects international norms such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's conventions, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Group has also established the Toray Group Policy for Human Rights , which lays out the Group's commitment to ensuring that it is not complicit in any human rights violations in the overall supply chain, which includes not only itself, but also suppliers and contract processing destinations, and to promptly and appropriately addressing issues if and when they arise. In addition, Toray respects human rights upon purchase of raw materials, and makes sure that the purchase  is  in  accordance  with  its CSR  Procurement Guidelines and that there is no forced labor, slave labor, or unfair low-wage labor upon production. In the event it has tentative confirmation that there are any problems, Toray's policy is to immediately suspend transactions.\n\n## Identifying, Assessing, and Preventing Human Rights Risk\n\nToray  Group  conducts surveys  related  to  awareness, education, and other human rights promotion activities once per year at all offices and plants, major group companies in Japan, and overseas subsidiaries and affiliated companies. The Group verifies the\n\nresults of these through the Human Rights Promotion Committee  in  Japan  and  the  Global  Human  Rights Promotion Committee. From among the results, the Group identifies human rights related issues and problematic points, as well as points of concern, and investigates and implements initiatives in accordance with the human rights promotion framework. Moreover, the Group has designed systems that enable group employees to report and consult on human rights issues as part of its efforts to take prompt, appropriate action when a problem occurs and to help reduce human rights risk.\n\n## Implementation of Human Rights Training\n\nIn order to promote a correct understanding and awareness of human rights, Toray conducts an annual human rights  awareness  campaign,  and  at  each  office  and plant, the Company holds training sessions for personnel in charge of operations and managers, as well as study sessions that utilize workplace meetings, in order to raise the human rights awareness of each and every employee. In fiscal 2020, remote training was provided to each office and plant in conjunction with the human rights awareness campaign. In addition, in March 2021, the Company held an annual e-learning program on corporate ethics and legal compliance, specifically on human rights , for all executives and employees (including temporary, part-time, and dispatched employees), with 6,849 participants attending.\n\n## Securing and Developing Human Resources\n\nBased on on-the-job training, Toray systematically implements specialized training by grade and business field, and through personnel systems such as rotations and assessments,  seeks  to  develop  professional  human resources who can perform globally. Toray also makes efforts to expand and raise the level of key personnel who are ready to put their strong capabilities to use in taking action on the frontlines, and strengthens their skills as future management candidates who can lead the next generation. The Company also dispatch personnel to the world's top universities and public institutions where they endeavor to acquire the foremost knowledge and techniques in various fields and to conduct joint research.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, to prevent the spread of COVID-19, many internal training programs were cancelled, as was the dispatch of personnel to domestic and overseas universities and public institutions, while participation in training and academic conferences was limited to those that were held online. As a result, the training expenditures per employee in fiscal 2020 was \u00a536,092 , compared to \u00a596,821 in the previous fiscal year.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of its efforts to secure employment at its production plants where production fell due to the worsening of market conditions, Toray provided  education  and  training  for  approximately 2,200 personnel involved in production to improve various skills that will be useful when production volume recovers.",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives for Career Development Utilizing New HR Information System\n\nToray has introduced its ' career sheet ' as a human resources  development  tool  to  promote  employee growth. By using the career sheet, employees reflect on their own past work experience and the level of skills required in their field, and in-depth career-focused discussions take place between supervisors and their subordinates. In fiscal 2020, 23% of employees had made use of the career sheet, exceeding the target of 20%.\n\n## Systematically Securing, Developing and Promoting National Staff Outside Japan\n\nOne of Toray Group's management issues is to systematically secure, train, and promote national staff at its affiliated companies outside Japan, and the Group is actively promoting them to the management level of each company. In addition, in fiscal 2020, two core personnel from overseas affiliates were appointed as Toray's Vice Presidents, and three as Toray's directors (a position equivalent to a senior management in terms of duties and responsibilities), and these executives are participating in Toray Group management.\n\n## Promoting Diversity\n\nToray Group is endeavoring to promote diversity toward the creation of thriving workplaces in which a diverse range of individuals can fully demonstrate their potential.\n\n## Fostering an Organizational Culture Conducive to the Career Advancement of Women\n\nToray has long advanced the creation of workplace envi-\n\nronments in which women will feel comfortable in performing their duties. The number of female employees in upper-level positions has increased steadily, and as of April 2021, women held 9.8% of unit manager or higher positions , and 5.6% of section manager or higher positions . In addition, in June 2015, Toray appointed its first female director (a position equivalent to a senior management in terms of duties and responsibilities). As of March 2021, there was one female director.\n\nIn March  2021,  the  Company  formulated  and announced a five-year action plan (April 2021 to March 2026) with the aim of increasing the retention rate of female employees and the ratio of female employees in management positions. The targets set in this action plan are as follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Raise the ratio of female managers from the fiscal 2020 level of 5.1% to 6.5%.\n- \u00b7 For employees who have been with the Company for up to 10 years, the ratio of female to male employees who continue to be employed shall be 1.0 for each human resources management category.\n\n## Hiring Diverse Human Resources\n\nToray  Group  is  committed  to  securing  outstanding human resources who have a high sense of ambition and who can play an active role in global business, regardless of gender, nationality, or career history at the time of hiring. In promoting globalization, Toray has\n\nbeen hiring regardless of nationality since 1998, and has hired 112 foreign nationals as full-time employees by fiscal 2020. The Company is actively recruiting  non-Japanese  employees,  mainly  international students to Japan, as well as Japanese students who have graduated from overseas universities. Each of these hires is playing an active role by utilizing his/her outstanding abilities and individuality.\n\n## Employment of Persons with Disabilities\n\nToray Group hires and employs persons with disabilities, from those with physical challenges to persons with intellectual and mental challenges. The Group is making workplace improvements to remove physical barriers for persons with handicaps as well as instituting safety measures. Additionally, the Group provides comprehensive training upon work placement and gathers feedback from persons with disabilities to make workplace improvements. Further, Toray meets Japan's legal minimum of 2.2% persons with disabilities, as do 62.5% of Toray group companies in Japan. Group companies actively seek to hire persons with disabilities through public organizations and job placement agencies. However, some individual group companies do not meet the mandated legal requirement due to hiring difficulties.\n\n## Creating a Positive Workplace for Employees\n\nToray has worked to further improve systems that help employees  achieve  a  harmonious  balance  between work and family life by offering a wider variety of lifestyle options for both men and women. In particular, the systems Toray provides for childcare, family care, and maternity protection exceed the legally mandated minimums and have been improved for easy use. In 2007, Toray was certified as an employer that complies with the action plan standards under the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising NextGeneration Children . From fiscal 2020, the Company is introducing an hourly annual paid leave system that allows employees to take hourly leave, an interoffice interval system, and hourly nursing and care leave.\n\n## Employee Health\n\nToray views employee health management as a management priority, and thus actively implements measures  that  encourage  employee  health,  including sharing  health  information  via  in-house  communication tools, holding participatory events that utilize health related  information  sites,  and  organizing  awareness seminars for the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases. Toray is also addressing mental health, and has been independently  implementing  employee  stress  checkups through an external provider. Toray uses the results of these checkups in helping employees to recognize their own stress levels, supporting approaches to dealing with stress, and improving the workplace environment. In recognition of these efforts, Toray has received\n\nconsecutive Health  and  Productivity  Management Organization certification .",

Certainly, Toray's success in building great teams depends on hiring the best people, but that's only the beginning of the story. To inspire the best from the best, a leader must give his teams a creative stake in their work and control over their outcomes. That requires a lot of trust. It means trusting your people to work things out and make the right calls. As the leader, I have to be the coach who listens carefully, who creates an environment that fosters success, and who then praises his people for what they've accomplished.\n\nAnother  core  value  is  'safety  first,'  which  is especially important during these challenging times. We're  a  manufacturing  company,  and  we  greatly value high output. What I tell my team, though, is not at the sacrifice of safety. If something's wrong, don't run a broken process. Take a step back. Ask, 'What do we need to do to fix the equipment or adjust the environment so that no one on the team is injured?' Our commitment to safety extends to our local communities in the U.S. and to the global society, as well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMike Brandmeier\n\nPresident & CEO, Toray Plastics (America) Inc.\n\nHow does your leadership vision tie in with the 'Toray way' of business and innovation to build solutions for humanity?

The corporation exists to serve society, not the other way around. It's a message I took to heart.\n\nTo  be  a  successful  leader,  you  have  to  move beyond the straight management-by-objectives approach. Don't misunderstand me; at Toray we're goal-focused and our success hinges upon our meeting objectives. To meet targets, however, you have to inspire people, make them believe that the team's objectives are truly important. By working together as one, we achieve goals for the good of society. That's the Toray way.\n\nAn excellent example of how the Toray spirit has flourished  at  Toray  Plastics  (America),  or  TPA,  is found in our story. TPA was established in 1985 and for the first ten years it was a manufacturing extension of Toray Industries. That meant 100% of products were designed in Japan and manufactured in the U.S. Jump ahead to 2021, and 80% of what we produce is designed, developed and commercialized based on our U.S. R&D team's efforts. We're proud of that achievement, but it could never have happened without the support of our parent company. Investing heavily in R&D with the goal of contributing to society is in Toray's genetic make-up, and it is what makes Toray Group, and TPA, the preferred partner of choice among our largest customers. We are a dynamic organization that has entrusted its teams with creative responsibility, inspired by the common goal of working for the benefit of humanity and the planet.",

        "page_content": "Your team is focused on the R&D of eco-friendly plastics, and yet within the pursuit of that goal resides a paradox: the development of sustainable solutions may require the consumption of more resources than are affordable or even available. How does TPA forge collaborative strategies for renewable innovation?\n\nIt's true that we face huge challenges across the materials industry. According to recent research, the world needs as much as a tenfold improvement in the eco-efficiency of resources and materials by 2050 so that an estimated population of nine billion will be able to live comfortably within the planet's means. At TPA, one of our greatest challenges is the development of food packaging that phases out hydrocarbons [compounds made from fossil fuels]. The final product must provide to the food the same protection that we have today and simultaneously meet the long-term economic targets set by the current film options. It's a big challenge!\n\nWe  believe  that  Toray  is  ideally  positioned  to meet that challenge. Our winning will be based on the same collaborative spirit that has driven all Toray breakthroughs-from carbon fiber that reduces the Boeing Dreamliner's carbon footprint to biofuel made from sugarcane waste in Thailand.\n\nOur breakthroughs will be built on R&D synergies between TPA and the entire Toray Group, as we work together as a team to devise cutting-edge packaging solutions. Once again, global teamwork will enable the critical task of bringing viable products to market.  It  also  means  collaborating  with  global  food companies  to  understand  their  needs  and  objectives. The Toray Group's fundamental understanding of 'Innovation by Chemistry' and its commitment to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontribute to society position us to tackle this complex problem and be the innovator of new sustainable products that we believe can have a positive impact on the world in which we live.\n\nIn leading a firm with a Japanese parent company,  how  do  you  in  Rhode  Island  and  Toray Industries in Japan foster team spirit across cultures that can be quite different?\n\nI'm an admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt and in particular his speech 'Citizenship in a Republic.' It offers a message that transcends East and West and captures the 'never give up' spirit for which the Japanese people and Toray are renowned.\n\nIn the speech, Roosevelt salutes the indomitable spirit of people who, no matter how difficult the challenge, rise up time after time and continue to do their best. Among them is that individual 'whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause.'\n\nIt is that kind of spirit, which I find every day in the men and women who work across the Toray Group, that leads our people and our teams to make such a positive contribution to society. In cherishing it, we embody the best of both worlds-we share common traits of curiosity, perseverance, diversity, creativity and, above all, commitment, which make a difference to humanity's common journey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWritten by The Wall Street Journal Custom Studios, 2020-2021 https://partners.wsj.com/toray/essential-materials/",

        "page_content": "Toray Industries, Inc. Integrated Annual Report 2021\n\n## The Value of Developing Cultural Bridges in Business\n\nCan you explain why you believe that a profound understanding and respect for local culture is so critical to building a meaningful worldwide presence?\n\nHaving worked at Toray for almost 30 years, I believe localization that organically links people and products through a deep understanding of local cultures is the key to our company's global success. From consumers to business partners to employees, local people are crucial to establishing strong foundations in a particular market. Recognizing this has enabled Toray to understand the tastes and psychology of Chinese consumers, to respond to the needs of business partners and customers, and to improve motivation and productivity by strengthening internal communication with employees. The Chinese market is huge and competition is intense, so global manufacturers must make it their mission to produce and sell high-spec, low-cost products that local manufacturers cannot match.\n\nThere is a saying in Sun Tzu's Art of War that I'm particularly fond of: 'If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.' I constantly reflect on these words when seeking solutions to management problems. I believe that if Toray can understand and respect the culture of the country or region in which it operates, it will be able to fully understand the logic and philosophy that shape the market economy, policies and other factors, so that globalization can follow naturally.\n\nIn your career with Toray, how have you personally built bridges between cultures and fostered inspirational local bonds to drive innovation and manufacturing excellence?\n\nAs  a  high-tech  company  engaged  in  the  manufacture  of advanced materials, Toray has been actively pursuing business opportunities in China since the 1990s. At that time, China had not yet joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). As the head of our textile operations in Nantong, I realized that the level of technology at midstream and downstream manufacturers was still relatively low, and that Toray did not fully understand the needs of Chinese customers. Convinced that this was the key to success, I proposed a number of business reforms to make us more competitive, including greater use of locally produced materials and the streamlining of logistics. To better understand the business environment in China, I tried to get senior management to engage more actively with the Chinese market. On one occasion, I drove my Japanese staff to an employee's country home far from our workplace where we ate dumplings and talked with the employee's family to gain a deeper understanding of what Chinese consumers think.\n\nBy gathering raw information through many channels, I've been able to get top management to better understand my proposals, while strengthening ties with Chinese customers has allowed us to achieve a better balance between the mix of standard, mass-produced products and differentiated, high value-added products that we offer. Today, Toray Nantong's textile business is stronger than ever.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gao Zhiwen\n\nDirector of the Board & Vice President, Toray Industries (China), Co., Ltd.\n\nPlease  discuss  your  unique  cultural  take  on  leveraging ancient Chinese philosophy to drive a 21st-century corporate mission. What are the lessons global businesspeople can learn from The Analects of Confucius or Records of the Three Kingdoms?\n\nChina is rich in schools of thought and philosophies. We study the Records of the Three Kingdoms and The Water Margin in elementary school, and The Four Books and Five Classics and The Analects in junior high and high school. And we incorporate the five cardinal Confucian virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom and fidelity into our work and lives. These values have influenced my understanding of what it means to be a member of society and of the Toray organization.\n\nPeople in China often say that The Analects of Confucius enable you to rule the world because they contain countless management philosophies. The core philosophy of The Analects is harmony, which in terms of corporate management I understand to mean co-operation and integration with all stakeholders. The Records of the Three Kingdoms is another work that contains sound management advice. In a homogeneous market environment, I think the key to gaining market share is to grasp the needs and psychology of the target group and provide differentiated products that other companies cannot imitate.\n\nIf we adapt these ancient precepts to today's business world we can 'strategize in our tent to win battles a thousand leagues away.'\n\nCultural difference isn't only about countries; it can also mean different perspectives between business strategists and researchers, or management and the factory floor. How do you deploy your bridge-building vision to foster common purpose among different layers of the organization?\n\nI believe that diversity is what makes things interesting and that a company's development can be accelerated by people who come up with outstanding ideas. I also believe that making good use of the different personalities in a hierarchy can be a driving force for the development of a company and for individual growth. Based on this thinking, and with a good understanding of Japanese companies and business in China and Japan, I have been able to reliably serve as a bridge between Japanese and Chinese people by valuing three principles. First, understanding and respect: seeing things from the perspective of others, fulfilling one's own role, and building mutual trust and co-operation. Second, knowledge of others: making the most of their strengths, boldly entrusting them with tasks, and providing strong backup. Finally, sharing and promoting: communicating the company's vision and strategy correctly and sharing goals. These principles create an atmosphere where people and the organization are full of vitality and enthusiasm.\n\nI was born in Xi'an, where the Silk Road begins-the historical trade route connecting East and West, where both cultures were strongly connected and influenced one another, playing an important role in the development of the global economy and social systems. As such, this perspective is engrained in my DNA.",

        "page_content": "How does your personal experience developing the RO-110 water membrane system influence your vision of corporate management-and your overall commitment to building teams that forge transformative sustainability solutions?\n\nLooking ahead to the sort of world the Toray Group wants to see in 2050, one of the greatest challenges is to ensure that everyone has access to safe water and air, and that the natural environment around the world is restored. That's why we're promoting Green Innovation (GR) business activities across the company.\n\nAs the lead inventor of the RO-110 system, I created a tool that enables end users to maintain stable reverse-osmosis membrane operations by employing a unique diagnostic method and Big Data processing to monitor RO membrane use and predict operational errors in advance. With the launch of this system, we've been able to establish a complete aftersales service network for RO membranes throughout China, and can advise customers on economical treatment methods, which has strengthened the bonds of trust we have with them.\n\nAs one of the world's leading manufacturers of water treatment membranes, Toray provides customers with more comprehensive and efficient solutions. We also analyze operational data from all customer sites to ensure intelligent system management and optimal membrane performance, delivering high added value to our customers that enhances the competitiveness of our brand.\n\nHaving  led  the  development  of  the  RO-110,  I  strongly believe that close collaboration between salespeople and the R&D team is necessary for the creation of any product or service. By enabling sales staff to communicate user requests to the R&D team in real time, research and development of differentiated products can proceed smoothly and new business opportunities can be realized.\n\n## Can you share an anecdote of a creative or commercial breakthrough made possible through an approach of building cultural bridges?\n\nIn 1994, Toray secured an industrial site of one million square meters in the Economic and Technological Development Zone of Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, China, to prepare for the establishment of certain of our subsidiaries and the start of fullscale integrated textile products polymerization, yarn making, weaving and dyeing. But when China joined the WTO in 2001, transportation infrastructure in regional cities was still rather underdeveloped.  Supervisory  personnel  often  had  to  travel back and forth between Japan and Nantong to oversee construction of our project and they had to go through Shanghai, which was inconvenient. Toray's then-president, Katsunosuke Maeda, suggested we call for the opening of direct flights between Nantong and Japan. Acting on this, I worked directly with relevant people inside and outside the company to call on local and central governments and encourage them to improve infrastructure access. As a result, there are now several flights a week between Nantong and Nagoya and Osaka. I believe that much of the region's subsequent economic development owes a great deal to the foresight of Toray's management at that time.\n\nHow  have  you  been  able  to  deploy  your  principles  of respect for difference, loyalty and sincerity, and motivation for innovation to attract the best Chinese talent to Toray?\n\nToray currently has more than 46,000 employees, of which about 29,000 are overseas. As a truly global company, Toray respects the cultures and social norms of the countries and regions in which it operates. One of the basic management policies  outlined  in  our  corporate  philosophy  is  to  provide\n\nmeaningful  work  and  fair  opportunities.  In  this  way,  Toray ensures that employees are loyal and faithful to each other, and able to communicate freely, which in turn enables them to build good relationships and work efficiently. I believe that creating such an environment is one of the key reasons we are able to attract so many excellent Chinese employees.\n\n## What makes China such an important market, both from a business point of view and the broader perspective of Toray's mission to innovate for the betterment of humanity in an age of COVID-19 and climate change?\n\nToray's business development in China started with the establishment of a trading company in Hong Kong in 1955, and as of March 2021 it has invested approximately 20.1 billion RMB in facilities in China, and has 38 consolidated subsidiaries employing close to 10,000 people. This is comparable to the number of employees at Toray's headquarters in Japan.\n\nThe Chinese economy is the second-largest in the world, and despite the impact of COVID-19 its GDP is expected to grow by 8% in 2021. It is an extremely important market for Toray, and the country's rising standard of living and the sophistication of its industrial development coincide with the goals of our Green Innovation and Life Innovation business strategies. We will continue to provide products and services that offer new value and high quality, while at the same time actively working to improve the global environment. Since the start of the pandemic, China has struck a balance between measures to control the virus and the resumption of economic activities. Toray's protective clothing, nonwoven fabrics for masks and hygienic air filtration, and materials for IT equipment have all played a role in helping China achieve that balance.\n\n## Please discuss the future of Toray Industries (China) Co., Ltd. (TCH), especially in terms of exciting innovations and how your unique approach to globally-minded, locally-focused management will contribute to ongoing success.\n\nTCH conducts business in China worth more than 400 billion yen a year. We remain fully committed to expanding this business. Looking 10, 20, and even 30 years ahead, it's clear that society will not be able to develop sustainably unless problems such as environmental issues, declining birth rates and aging populations, and the increasing sophistication of medical care are solved. At the same time, China is leading the world in the development of 5G and AI-technologies necessary for the betterment of human society, and in which dramatic progress will be possible if appropriate new materials can be made available. TCH's mission is to 'produce in the right place and sell in the right place' the materials necessary for the development of the Chinese economy. We are already using materials informatics (MI) and AI to research and develop electronic information materials that take into account the various characteristics and structures that those new materials will be required to offer. Projects related to 5G and AI materials are being steadily promoted to expand our business.\n\nOn a personal level, I will continue to place the highest priority on the realization of Toray's corporate philosophy, and do my utmost to contribute to the further growth of our business in China by strengthening internal communication and deepening external collaboration through the application of the philosophies I've described here today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWritten by The Wall Street Journal Custom Studios, 2020-2021 https://partners.wsj.com/toray/essential-materials/",

The Company also expanded the composition of the Governance Committee, which, chaired by an outside director, serves as an advisory board to the Board of Directors and acts as the nomination and remuneration committee, to 3 internal members of the Board and 4 outside directors. In addition, the Company introduced an executive officer system to make management execution more flexible and efficient. In this roundtable discussion, the 4 outside directors exchanged their frank opinions on the new governance structure, Toray's issues, and their expectations for the Company.\n\nIto How would you like to be involved and what role would you like to play in the Board of Directors and Governance Committee in which you participate as an outside director?\n\nNoyori With the introduction of the executive officer system, I think the roles of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee have become clearer. Companies must properly manage their businesses in accordance with their respective philosophies and as public institutions trusted by society. Directors are responsible for weighing the appropriateness of various subjects for\n\ndiscussion from this perspective. In addition, I think it is important to discuss medium- and long-term direction and issues. I believe that outside directors, in particular, must not only respond promptly to individual situations from an outside perspective, but also express their opinions more objectively and more fairly.\n\nKaminaga As a member of the Board of Directors, I believe that my fundamental role is to contribute to the realization of Toray's long-term corporate vision as outlined in the Toray Group Sustainability Vision, which sets out the world as envisioned by the Toray Group in 2050, and TORAY VISION 2030 (VISION 2030), which I see as an extension of all that Toray has cultivated over the years since its founding. With this in mind, I strive to monitor and provide advice from the perspective of how each operational issue is positioned in the Company as a whole, and how it demonstrates comprehensive capabilities across the entire Company, including horizontal expansion.\n\nWithin the Governance Committee, I would like to set out issues to be discussed on all governance matters and raise them to the Board of Directors. In addition, regarding its capacity as the nomination and remuneration committee, I intend to provide advice on how we should utilize core personnel for business promotion and on incentive and compensation systems from my business experience globally.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Futagawa Besides the essential role of deciding what is required by law and the Articles of Incorporation, I believe that the Board of Directors must also discuss Toray's overall direction. As a newcomer to the Company, I actively attended not only Board of Directors meetings, but also Vice Presidents meetings, as well as other meetings, including research presentations, that I was invited to, in order to gain a better understanding of the Company. I think I probably qualify for a perfect attendance award (laughs). As I had been working as an office worker for a long time in the hierarchy of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, I understand people tend to make comments gauging their bosses' feelings. Outside directors, on the other hand, are in a position to speak freely and independently of the organization, and I believe that discussions are becoming more active by raising issues from that perspective. I also think that the Governance Committee system is one that respects diverse ways of thinking, which I intend to bear in mind in my monitoring role.\n\nIto I attend Board of Directors meetings with the motto  'read  the  context,  not  the  mood'  about agenda items. I know that it takes a long time to put the agenda together. But my feeling is that if I try to sense the mood of the people in charge and think too much about their efforts, I will be unable to say anything, so I steer clear of trying to 'read the mood.' That is number one.\n\nNumber two is to make judgements on a mediumto long-term basis. As those who are engaged in practical  business  submit  items  to  pass,  sometimes the medium- to long-term time perspective is overlooked. As an outsider, I'm very aware of this. However, Toray is a company where 'long-term continuity' has taken root, so we may not have to worry too much about it. Number three, I am conscious of whether or not the Company's activities and the decisions made by the Board of Directors can be explained  to  stakeholders,  including  shareholders and other investors, and whether or not they have\n\nbeen sorted and fine-tuned to an explainable level.\n\nAs chair of the Governance Committee, I am very conscious of making sure that governance is not only a question of form but also has substance. Substance is about action; it is not something that can be written into the rules of the Corporate Governance Code. There is no rule book to guide us, that means, how do we improve the quality and effectiveness of Toray's governance? In this respect, I think there have been great improvements. One example is the succession plan, which is now being discussed along with the names of candidates. I believe this is a reflection of our collective efforts to make the Governance Committee work.\n\n## Ito How do you apply your expertise and experience in the Board of Directors and Governance Committee?\n\nNoyori My  focus  has  been  on  education  and research for a long time, and I have been involved in science and technology policy, keenly interested in the development of industrial technology. I do not have any knowledge of business management. But we have people with vast experience and knowledge in this field here, and I see my role as offering a different perspective. In the first place, I understand that the Board of Directors is a public-spirited organization consisting of people in leadership positions with broad management skills and high-level expertise. The CEO is then required to comprehensively synthesize this wisdom and make the final management decision. Under these circumstances, we cannot expect any individual to be omniscient Rather, each individual director must recognize issues from their  different  perspectives,  provide  diverse  opinions, and contribute to the overall judgment of the CEO. I hope that I can contribute to this.\n\nKaminaga I have been in positions involving corporate management from a medium- to long-term perspective, gaining experience in global business",

        "page_content": "development, from R&D to commercialization, and then  to  industrialization.  Against  that  backdrop,  I think I can say my skills include technology, business management, and global experience. As Mr. Ito has mentioned, Toray is engaging in unwavering management from a medium- to long-term perspective. However, if the medium- to long-term is the big picture, getting there also hinges on the details and the here and now. Even if Toray has a medium-to longterm perspective, what must be done today and tomorrow should not be neglected and postponed. In doing so, any medium- to long-term vision will be nothing more than a pie in the sky. From what I have seen over the past year, I do not think Toray has any concerns here, but I will continue to monitor it firmly based on my own experience.\n\nFutagawa I have been involved in public administration and have learned the importance of disclosing negative information such as scandals to the public as soon as possible to show how they are being dealt with. I am ashamed to say that I had an experience where the situation got worse because of a delay in the disclosure of information. Thinking of it as an example of how not to behave, I would like to help the Company in the area of information disclosure and compliance.\n\nIto I have continued to make frequent comments based on my expertise in mainly governance, business  administration,  accounting,  and  ESG  theory. From that standpoint, I would like Board members to have a strong awareness of the cost of capital. However, just having that awareness is not enough; I would like to participate in bringing this awareness into the Board's deliberations and up to the decision-making process. As a result, for example, the term cost of capital was introduced upon the discussion of the reduction of strategic holdings. During the past year, one issue that came up for discussion was that of listed subsidiaries. However, this issue was properly discussed, and the content of the disclosure\n\nwas selected as a best practice by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\nFrom an ESG perspective, I have been paying particular attention to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Amid growing interest in climate change issues globally, I would like to discuss TCFD at Board meetings. As digital transformation (DX) is also gaining traction, I hope to encourage efforts to raise Toray's DX level even higher.\n\n## Ito In fiscal 2020, the number of members of the Board of Directors was reduced and its composition was altered. What changes do you feel this has brought about?\n\nNoyori With the introduction of the executive officer system, I think the agenda of Board of Directors meetings has become much more organized. On the other hand, I think we should probably have discussions on Toray's long-term vision and future plans for the post-COVID-19 era. There are people of all ages working at Toray, and I see this as our duty to the younger generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIto The reduction in the size of the Board of Directors and the increase in the number of outside directors did not happen overnight, but were the result of the sincere efforts of President Nikkaku and the members of the Governance Committee to address related issues. The smaller scale has made discussions easier. The number of outside directors has increased, but their comments have actually become more frequent, and I feel that outside corporate auditors have also become more active in contributing comments. What I realized very keenly is that while we may say that governance is not about form but about substance, the changes in Toray's Board of Directors show that improving the form enhances the substance.\n\nIn  addition  to  deliberations  and  reports,  the Governance Committee discussed the inclusion of Discussion Items, which were promptly agreed to by",

        "page_content": "President Nikkaku and others.\n\nRather than just throwing out a proposal like an M&A deal and saying, 'let's discuss it and decide,' we  should  hold  discussions  on  agenda  items  in advance that will be decided later. I think this has really improved the level of the Board of Directors.\n\nKaminaga I cannot say how things have changed as I did not know how things were last fiscal year. However,  I  believe  I  had  some  understanding  of Toray's business from the outside, and I attended all the meetings where participation was voluntary, as  did  Mr.  Futagawa,  to  confirm  my  understanding. As a result, my impression was that the Vice Presidents Meetings functioned very well, and also that cross-functional capabilities such as R&D and marketing operated admirably.\n\nTo be honest, however, and as Mr. Noyori mentioned, I feel that the Board of Directors has not yet fully discussed Toray's future. I believe this to be an agenda item that should be taken up and discussed at Board of Directors' meetings. I think it is important for the Governance Committee to sort out those issues and bring them to the Board for discussion. The year 2030, which is the target year of VISION 2030, is just around the corner, and I think it is time for us to think more about what exactly we should do.\n\nI also think that the Toray Group Sustainability Vision, envisioned by Toray Group in 2050, is also not that far off considering the theme of the vision. I am raising an issue, rather than stating the rate of change from last fiscal year.\n\nIto It is certainly hard to discuss things that are not on the agenda at Board meetings. I think it is very important for the effectiveness of the Board of Directors to deliberate on matters including the agenda as much as  possible  at  the  Governance  Committee.  Also, while resolutions need to be decided at the time they arise, Discussion Items do not. There is a lot of flexibility in agenda setting and I would like to see\n\nus make better use of the Discussion Items section during Board meetings.\n\n## Ito Moving  on,  what  are  your  thoughts  on Toray's value creation?\n\nFutagawa It is vital to acquire earnings power to meet the expectations of shareholders and to properly return profits. At the same time, I believe that we  cannot  create  lasting  value  unless  we  manage our business from a medium- to long-term perspective while taking into consideration our various stakeholders. In this respect, Toray has an excellent corporate philosophy: of 'contributing to society through the creation of new value with innovative ideas, technologies and products.' I highly appreciate this philosophy as a corporate culture that motivates all employees to create new value.\n\nKaminaga Toray  has  many  businesses  and  its strengths  are  disseminated  in  various  ways,  but they are all derived from its core technologies, and I believe that is its true strength. From what I have seen over the past year, I believe that Toray has established an excellent system to demonstrate its comprehensive strengths through technological fusion. Corporate management means to develop strengths and reduce weaknesses. With that in mind, I would like to see the Company dig deeper into its strengths and further expand them to create new value.\n\nNoyori It is essential that Toray's technological capabilities, which are the lifeline of the Company, remain at the top level globally. All employees of Toray, operating under the banner of leading-edge technologies, must commit themselves to this task. Industrial technologies are destined to continue the process of evolution and transformation through scientific progress. There is no such thing as maintaining the status quo. The fact that Toray has earned a deep trust from society as a technology-based materials company is due to the efforts of successive",

        "page_content": "generations of technology leaders, and the combination of a 'pursuit of the ultimate limits' attitude and technological fusion. Toray has identified the Green Innovation (GR) and Life Innovation (LI) businesses as growth areas for the future, and I think this is the right direction. In addition, the Company has accumulated a wide range of technologies and knowledge that will enable it to grow in the medium- and longterm, and I feel that it is maintaining a level of competence that is unrivaled in the world. This is a great accomplishment, and I hope that the Company will continue to develop new technologies that contribute to the world without becoming overconfident.\n\nIto Toray is a company that specializes in materials and is also very focused on value-added products. It is also a treasure trove of new technologies. I think that 'long-term continuity' is also a key feature and strength. The Company also has outstanding materials from the perspective of environmental issues and has affinity with the SDGs. Nowadays, the world is focusing on 'ambidextrous management' because it is essential to not only deepen existing technologies but also to explore opportunities for new technologies. I believe that Toray is doing this very well.\n\nHowever, I am not sure that the Company has done enough to get this across to investors, it seems to be a bit of a waste. Ambidextrous management is a difficult thing to pull off. Toray has been able to monetize its GR and LI businesses, and I hope the Company can communicate more about them in the dialogue with investors.\n\n## Ito Next, what are your views on the risks and issues facing Toray?\n\nNoyori From the standpoint of risk, while it is easy to become complacent in light of past successes and fall into the trap of merely continuing existing businesses, I think this is an issue that is common to all manufacturing industries in Japan. Again, technologies continue to advance. With the rise of companies\n\nfrom Asia, Japanese companies, including Toray, will not be able to maintain global competitiveness if they are on the defensive. Toray's businesses span the large and small, and have a wide variety of products, but I think there needs to be courage to exit those areas where the Company is not in the top five in the world. And of course, new winning products need to be created.\n\nI believe that in the future, the emphasis will be on functionality rather than the structural properties of materials. We cannot break away from mass production and mass consumption by simply producing versatile structures such as fibers and plastics from petroleum raw materials. Looking to the future, we need materials that contribute to a circular economy, such as those that will lead to a fundamental reduction of plastic waste. At the same time, the physical functions required for electronic materials and the  biological  functions  required  for  pharmaceutical materials are becoming evermore sophisticated, and highly useful materials that provide these functions are becoming more and more necessary. After all, we cannot create value without new materials. I believe that the world has very high expectations for Toray. I think the idea that materials have the power to fundamentally change society is absolutely true. To meet such expectations, I would like to see all of Toray's people embrace 'inner innovation' and focus on inventing innovative materials with a view to the future, as the Company did with carbon fiber in the past. To this end, we need the spirit of a researcher, and I would ask for patience and tolerance on the part of management.\n\nKaminaga As Mr. Noyori aptly pointed out, I am keenly aware that the 'functional' aspects of materials is becoming more important than their 'structural' properties. In past business activities, I have been engaged in the microfabrication of new materials. Now, the Company is facing a situation where it needs to think of processing that enhances the functionality of the material itself, rather than just saying,",

        "page_content": "'we invented a new material, please process it.' For example, the brightness of LEDs varies considerably depending on how the material is processed as the material itself has its innate properties. This makes us think how we can bring materials to the fore, which is a golden opportunity, or conversely poses a risk if we make one false step.\n\nAlso, the business environment is changing at an accelerated pace. To be honest, as we are coexisting with COVID-19, anything can happen in this world. That is why I have often said that companies need to have a medium- to long-term vision, and actions need to be taken swiftly. I have seen Toray facing the COVID-19 pandemic, and I think it has excellent risk tolerance. However, I believe that we should make ourselves more resilient by being prepared for the unexpected to happen again. Also, given the diverse nature of the businesses, I am a little worried about sectionalism. I feel that everyone is very conscious about avoiding this. But I think it can happen before you know it. So, I think this is one of the points that I should monitor as an outside director. One of the issues is that there is a limit to what Toray alone can do, even if it had materials with the power to change society. So when it is better to work with a partner, I think the question is how far we can proceed and still successfully secure commercial application.\n\nFutagawa With carbon fiber, Toray has reaped the fruits of a sustained commitment over 50 years while never giving up. That represents nothing but longterm continuity as most companies gave up halfway through. However, we must not expect the same in all areas of our research. If we do that, the risk of research items not bearing fruit is incalculable. It is important for us to think about a risk-taking approach appropriate for our size, and seek ways to reduce risks in every way possible, while maintaining our long-term continuity.\n\nMeanwhile over the past year, I have had the opportunity to see a variety of research presentations, ranging from laboratory-level talks about how\n\ngood a product is, to discussions about something that could be ready for commercialization in two to three years. I have been excited and impressed. By the same token, it would be a danger signal if there were only a handful of laboratory-level presentations. In this regard, I think one of the issues and risks is whether we can maintain the motivation of employees who are trying to create something with their unfettered thought.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIto As I mentioned earlier, I think there is still room for improvement in such areas as the frequency of dialogue with investors. Even though we have had very positive feedback, is it reflected in our corporate value? Frankly, I think there is a gap between the intrinsic value of Toray and the share price as set in the capital markets. I do not think Toray has fallen into a conglomerate discount because of its wide range of businesses, but I think there is room for improvement in ensuring that investors really understand Toray's potential. Even if there is a little negative talk about Toray in the market, investors who believe that Toray has outstanding capabilities will not sell the Company's shares, and even if the stock price drops temporarily, it will soon bounce back. Dialogue is important to increase such supportive investors.\n\nAnother issue I see is the need to think more about our strategies regarding the balance between prices and added value. In addition, as is often said, strengths sometimes become risks. How do we deal with the fact that what we identified as value-added products see their potential erode in the face of mass production by price-competitive Chinese companies? Also, I would like the Board of Directors to discuss how to allocate capital across the Company, and in particular how to position the pharmaceutical and medical device fields in the overall business portfolio. Since Toray is engaged in such a wide range of businesses, insufficient resources tend to be allocated to each. How can we apply selection and focus in this context? While focusing on long-term continuity, which is considered a strength, the Company",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance\n\n## Basic Policy\n\nFrom the outset, one of Toray Group's managerial principles has been that the purpose of a company is to contribute to society. The Group has developed the Toray Philosophy that incorporates this principle. The Group systematizes  the  Toray  Philosophy  as  a  Corporate Philosophy,  Corporate  Missions,  Corporate  Guiding Principles, etc. The Corporate Missions clearly enunciate that the Group will practice 'sincere and trustworthy management' with regard to its shareholders. The Corporate Guiding Principles stipulate the Group's commitment to 'acting with fairness, high ethical standards and a strong sense of responsibility while complying with laws, regulations and social norms to earn trust and meet social expectations.' When establishing the corporate governance structure, the Group seeks to realize these philosophies as its basic policy.\n\n## Outline of Governance System and Reasons for Adopting the System\n\nToray operates as a company with a Board of Corporate Auditors and Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, which includes outside directors, decides on the business execution and supervises the execution of duties by the members of the Board. The Board of Corporate Auditors includes outside corporate auditors and independently audits the execution of duties by the members of the Board, separately from the Board of Directors and  the  executing  organization.  This  framework  is designed to secure the transparency and fairness of\n\ndecision made by the Board of Directors. In addition, there is a Governance Committee, which serves as a voluntary advisory body to the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee deliberates on all matters relating to corporate governance, enhancing the effectiveness of governance by the Board of Directors.\n\nToray Group operates in a broad spectrum of business fields at a global level. Business management and decision-making, as well as oversight, require assessment of a wide variety of risks from multiple perspectives based on expertise related to the day-to-day operations of the Group's worksites. To that end, the composition of the Board of Directors is designed to ensure that members bring a diverse range of perspectives to management oversight and decision-making. Meanwhile, outside directors are elected to the Board to ensure transparency and fairness, to ensure management oversight from an even broader perspective, and to obtain appropriate managerial advice from a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\nThe Board of Corporate Auditors is entirely independent of the Board of Directors. Based on professional expertise in finance, accounting, and law, as well as an understanding of the Group's businesses, the Board of Corporate Auditors exercises oversight over directors' execution of their duties.\n\n## Strengthening the Governance Framework\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Toray Group set the number of members of the Board of Directors to 12 and the number of outside directors to four in order to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and to strengthen the business execution framework. The Group also introduced an executive officer system for the purpose of flexibly  implementing  management  execution  based on quick decision-making that accurately reflects the\n\n## Corporate Governance Structures\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the Company conducted interviews with seven outside directors and outside corporate auditors to hear their opinions in relation to their responses to the questionnaire. The collection and tabulation of the questionnaire, and interviews were outsourced to a third-party organization to ensure transparency and objectivity. The survey results were analyzed and evaluated at the Governance Committee held on May 21, 2021, and the results of the analysis and evaluation were deliberated at the Board\n\n- of Directors' meeting held on June 16, 2021. The overview of the results of the analysis and evaluation shown below describes the contents resolved at the Board of Directors' meeting.\n- (1)  In fiscal 2020, the Board of Directors performed oversight and decision-making based on a deep understanding  and  sympathy  with  the  Management Philosophy and Corporate Missions. As a result, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in indicating the direction of corporate strategies and other major courses of action in an appropriate manner.\n- (2)  In fiscal 2020, the Board of Directors held 14 meetings in total to perform oversight and decision-making in a timely and appropriate manner. Furthermore, it promoted reviews on the scope of delegating decision-making authority. Through these initiatives, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in establishing an environment conducive to appropriate risk-taking by the senior management in an appropriate manner.\n- (3)  With respect to the 14 Board of Directors meetings held in fiscal 2020, the attendance rate of the members  of  the  Board  was  99.6%.  Outside  directors made remarks mainly from their respective professional viewpoints. The opinions, etc. at the Board of Directors meetings, including the abovementioned remarks, were appropriately reflected in measures taken by the management. With respect to transactions causing possible conflicts of interest, internal procedures to handle them were appropriately carried out.

And in order to gain this trust, it is essential to comply with the laws and regulations related to our business activities in each country in which we operate and maintain the highest level of integrity in all our actions. Therefore, top management focuses on its leadership role in making compliance a priority, while both the Group and its suppliers are required to promote ethics and compliance.\n\n## Ethics and Compliance Structure\n\nToray  has  established  an  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee chaired by the President and consisting of vice presidents. At this committee, management and workers come together to consider and discuss policies related to ethics and compliance. Moreover, this Committee  reports  on  the  operational  status  of  the whistle-blowing  system  established  by  Toray  Group, including  the  number  of  reports  (consultations)  and other details, to members of the Board.\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, this Committee met twice to deliberate and discuss Toray Group's ethics and compliance activity results for fiscal 2019 and the activity plans and progress updates for fiscal 2020. This Committee also discussed individual measures, including revision of the Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct and implementation  of  Compliance  Month.  Acting  as  leaders, divisional and departmental general managers at each workplace adopt a top-down approach toward promoting initiatives.\n\nIn initiatives for group companies around the world, Toray Group has established the Affiliate Companies' Compliance  Meeting  and  the  Overseas  Affiliate Companies' Compliance Meetings under the Ethics and Compliance  Committee.  Through  these  committees, Toray Group is promoting compliance activities in each company, country and region.\n\n## Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct\n\nToray reviewed the content of the Corporate Ethics and Legal Compliance Code of Conduct, and revised it as the Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct in May 2020. The revised code summarizes the compliance helpline, the promotion framework for ethics and compliance, and codes of conduct, which serve as a series of core\n\nrules that must be observed in different areas of business by Toray group companies and all executives and employees, including contracted, part-time and temporary workers, as a means of fully informing employees of these obligations and tools.\n\n- 1. Compliance for safety and the environment (1) Building a safe working environment (2) Caring for the environment\n- 2. Compliance for quality\n- (1)  Providing safe and satisfactory products to customers\n- (2) Proper quality data management\n- 3. Compliance for human rights\n- (1)  Respect for the character and individuality of employees\n- (2) Preventing harassment and discrimination\n- (3)  Respect for the human rights of all stakeholders\n- 4. Compliance for fair business activities\n- (1) Competing fairly\n- (2) Fair transaction and asset management\n- (3)  International trade control and security trade administration\n- (4) Compliance with applicable laws in general\n- 5. Compliance for intellectual property\n- (1) Respect for intellectual property rights of others\n- 6. Compliance for information management\n- (1) Information management\n- (2) Proper reporting and public disclosures\n\n## Corporate Ethics and Legal Compliance Education\n\nToray posts information on CSR and legal compliance on its corporate intranet. Toray Group circulates important information about legal and compliance matters that are highly relevant to its business in Japan and overseas. Group companies implement workshops to examine these matters and study cases of corporate misconduct in an effort to foster discussion in the workplace.\n\nSince  fiscal  2012,  Toray  has  provided  e-learning courses on corporate ethics and legal compliance for all  executives  and  employees,  including  contracted, part-time and temporary workers. In fiscal 2020, the Company covered the Ethics and Compliance Code of Conduct, which had been revised in May 2020, and human rights in training course themes. With regard to human rights issues, the Company used case studies based on actual reports and consultations within Toray Group as models to raise awareness among participants that issues can occur in their own departments. Group companies in Japan are using these materials to implement their own training.",

(TI) , a trading subsidiary of Toray Group, received a warning, which included a request to implement recurrence prevention measures and strict security export controls, under the name of the director of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau. The warning deemed that the carbon fiber for which TI had obtained an export license under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act and exported to China had been sold to third parties that TI had not obtained the license for, and that as a background, there were deficiencies  such  as  unproper  examinations  of transactions. With regard to what caused this situation to arise, Toray Group will thoroughly address the export controls and compliance for the entire group to prevent any recurrence.\n\n## Expanding the Whistle-Blowing System\n\nToray  established  the  Corporate  Ethics  and  Legal Compliance Helpline as a whistle-blowing system in fiscal 2003 and expanded the system to include all group companies in Japan in fiscal 2010. The Company has processed reports received based on internal rules. The number  of  inquiries  (consultations)  received  through the hotline and the details of the cases are reported to the Board of Directors by the Ethics and Compliance Committee, which convenes twice a year.\n\n## Reinforcing Compliance in Product Quality Assurance\n\nToray Group is pursuing five major issues to reinforce product quality assurance compliance throughout the Group.\n\n## 1.  Reinforcement of structures related to quality assurance systems of the entire Toray Group\n\nThe Group provides guidance to each division and group companies regarding their quality assurance system, and audits the effectiveness of these systems and the work done under them. Based on the formulated product quality assurance vision, the organizations design initiatives to close the gap between the vision and actual performance.\n\n## 2.  Development of human resources and creation of workplace culture not allowing any misconduct\n\nToray  has  designated  November  as  Quality  Month. Coinciding  with  this  initiative,  the  Company  has\n\nconducted  quality  assurance  compliance  education since fiscal 2020. By providing educational materials to Toray Industries as well as Group companies in and outside Japan, each department and company is taking the initiative in promoting training.\n\n## 3.  Understanding of actual state of agreements with customers and establishment of guidelines related to product quality (assurance)\n\nThe  Group  is  preparing  guidelines  for  product  quality assurance agreements and will use them to assess agreements and review their provisions as necessary.\n\n## 4.  Appropriate maintenance or control and modernization or fulfillment of measuring equipment\n\nThe Group prepared a risk assessment table for judging the necessity of upgrading or conducting maintenance on measuring equipment, and used them to identify devices in need of an upgrade.\n\n## 5.  Improvement of quality data management system to not allow any misconduct\n\nThe Group is developing data management systems that minimize human involvement, such as by automating measurement and transfer of measurement data, and issuance of inspection reports.\n\n## Improving Security Trade Controls\n\n## 1.  Sharing the Latest Trends and Management Strategies for Security Trade Controls\n\nConcerns about the spread of conventional mass weapons  of  destruction  and  changes  in  the  international security balance necessitate risk management addressing security trade controls.\n\nToray  convenes  a  Security  Trade  Administration Committee comprising executives of divisions that are involved  in  exports  and  technology  transfer.  In  fiscal 2020, the committee decided on measures to implement for the fiscal year after considering pressing risks based on recent international circumstances and regulatory trends. The committee members also convene a Divisional Security Trade Administration Committee that communicates corporate measures and implements supplementary programs, such as precautions to be taken by departments and group companies under its supervision.\n\n## 2. Practically Addressing Risks\n\nToray  Group  performs  risk  management  of  security trade controls with regard to the export of all products, devices, materials, and samples, as well as the transfer of technologies outside Japan.

Toray conducted training to provide the necessary practical knowledge to the mid-level employees that play a central role in implementing security trade controls, as well as training to newly appointed managers to encourage appropriate on-site management. (In the total of nine courses, 670 employees participated in Web conferences, and 4,758 via e-learning.)\n\nThe Company also conducted a series of advanced courses  for  employees  with  specialized  expertise. These hands-on courses were designed to better equip them with the skills necessary to conduct classifications, export transactions and technology transfers. (A total of 176 employees participated in Web conferences in four courses.)\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company  systematically  encourages employees to take the exam authorized by the Center for Information on Security Trade Controls in Japan. A total of 166 Toray group employees passed the exam in fiscal 2020, bringing the cumulative number of Toray Group employees who have passed the exam to 4,159 persons.\n\n## (2) Conduct regular audits\n\nToray  carried  out  paper  audits  and  onsite  audits  of group companies, and provided individualized guidance based on the results to help group companies make improvements.\n\n## (3) Enhanced information sharing and reporting\n\nToray integrated and centralized information on concerns such as suspicious trade inquiries, reported or consulted with the appropriate authorities as required, and took the appropriate measures. The Company also shared suspicious trade information at various company meetings, and took steps to improve its risk management.\n\n## (4) Improved inspection systems\n\nToray  established  a  link  between  the  security  trade administration system and the sales backbone system as part of regular operations in order to improve the infrastructure for preventing mistaken shipments due to human error. Moreover, the Company supported innovative initiatives designed to improve the efficiency of administration through the use of these systems, and widely deployed cases that have produced results.\n\n## Competition Law Compliance, Anti-Corruption, and Anti-Bribery\n\n## 1. Competition Law Compliance\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct, revised in May 2020, defines the code of conduct related to competition laws that must be observed by all Toray Group executives and employees. Educational materials related to competition laws have been prepared in Japanese and English for all Toray Group employees. Within Japan, the Group prepares and utilizes compliance training materials and gathers examples of compliance violations related to competition laws. In fiscal 2020, no legal action was taken against Toray Group on the grounds of antitrust law violations.\n\n## 2. Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery\n\nIn  January  2020,  Toray  Group  formulated  the  AntiBribery Regulations that explicitly prohibit offering and accepting bribes to or from public officials and business partners, and established the rules for approval and reporting when offering or receiving money or other benefits to or from public officials and business partners. Similar rules have also been introduced at both domestic and overseas group companies.\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct defines the  code  of  conduct  related  to  anti-corruption  and anti-bribery measures that must be observed by all Toray Group executives and employees. Accompanying guidelines and educational materials covering to the anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures have been prepared in Japanese and English for all Toray group employees and these are shared on a group-wide basis. In March 2020, Toray conducted e-learning training sessions for all executives and employees (including contracted, parttime and temporary workers) that covered the anti-bribery measures. Domestic affiliated companies also use similar teaching materials to provide education. No legal action was taken against Toray Group on anti-corruption or anti-bribery grounds in fiscal 2020.\n\n## Protection of Personal Information\n\nIn order to comply with Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information, Toray has established Regulations",

Audits are regularly conducted into the management conditions in each department.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company received no complaints concerning personal information and there were no data breaches. Major Toray Group companies in and outside Japan appropriately conduct management in accordance  with  the  management  systems  and  methods specified by the internal rules of each company.\n\n## Promotion of Mission B.E.A.R. Activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn fiscal 2018, Toray Group launched a new initiative with the slogan 'Have the integrity to do the right thing in the right way.' The initiative includes the following four principles for taking more effective action to ensure compliance.\n\n## Compliance Action Principles\n\n- B : Be fair, be honest and have integrity\n- E : Encourage respect and communication\n- A : Adopt  a genba (workplace) approach - Look to the facts!\n- R :  Responsibility  as  a  member  of  our  excellent company\n\nUnder the name 'Mission B.E.A.R.,' taking its acronym from the first word of each principle, Toray group companies  formulate  declarations  and  action  plans related to compliance, and implement initiatives that correspond to their individual situations. Toray Group implements  periodic  follow-ups  for  the  initiatives  of  each company, shares the effective initiatives of each company within the Group, and encourages each company to take the initiative in evolving their compliance activities.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Toray continued to assist each company's compliance promotion activities. Beginning with Compliance  Promotion  Month,  steps  were  actively taken to share compliance-related initiatives, new educational tools, and educational materials via video as a part of the Company's remote work endeavors. Through these activities every effort is being made to strengthen risk response that emphasizes factors unique to each region  and  type  of  business  while  reinforcing  Toray Group's integrity-driven corporate culture.\n\n## Implementing Internal Legal Audits\n\nIn fiscal 2016, Toray Group adopted a group-wide system for self-inspections and mutual internal control audits. Designated  divisions  of  Toray  and  designated  group companies in and outside Japan must receive an internal legal and compliance audit once in every three years.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, internal legal compliance audits were implemented for the designated departments of Toray and its group companies in Japan. In fiscal 2020, the Company confirmed the improvement status of problems found in the audit, verifying that 100% of the companies had  made  improvements  (including  companies  under improvement). To increase the effectiveness of audits related  to  high-priority  items-including,  antitrust  law, bribery regulations, insider trading regulations, and entry into  agreements-Toray  reviewed  the  audit  methods related to legal affairs and compliance in fiscal 2019 and implemented an internal legal audit in fiscal 2020. Nothing inappropriate was found in any of the items covered.\n\n## Tax Compliance\n\nToray Group is committed to meeting its tax responsibilities in accordance with local and national tax laws and related rules, as well as to meeting international standards such as OECD guidelines. With the growth of international transactions, transfer pricing is increasing in importance. The Group endeavors to suitably allocate its income by calculating transfer pricing based on the arm's length principle. Under the awareness that it is important to fulfill its social responsibilities as a corporation by administering taxes in a highly transparent manner, the Group redefined its basic approach to tax policies with which each employee must comply, and established the Toray Group Tax Policy in order to reliably implement tax compliance related initiatives to a greater extent. This policy has been applied globally starting in May 2020.\n\n## Basic Policy\n\n- 1.  Toray Group makes efforts to pay taxes appropriately by complying with the tax laws of each country and international taxation rules.\n- 2.  Toray Group makes efforts to enhance corporate value and maximize shareholder value while minimizing tax risks and optimizing tax expenses.\n- 3.  Toray Group will not conduct arbitrary tax avoidance using tax havens or other methods.\n- 4.  Toray Group establishes good relationships with the tax authorities of each country.",

Having  succeeded  in  absorbing  the  agent  within  the polyester fibers by means of our unique immobilization technology, MAKSPEC TM V received antiviral certification for enveloped  viruses  from  the  Japan  Textile  Evaluation  Technology Council. It also offers excellent commercial laundry washability. Furthermore, in a test conducted in accordance with the JIS standard antiviral test for textile products, for which COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was used, the virus was attached to the surface. When, after two hours, the concentration of remaining virus was measured, it was confirmed that this had decreased by 99.9% or more, similar to the test results using other enveloped viruses. Taking advantage of these features, we are expanding into a wide range of fields which have high needs for this effect, from uniform applications, such as customer service clothing, nursing, and school uniforms, to sports, casual apparel, fashionwear, and children's clothing.",

In contrast, the demand structure in some fields, for example fibers and textiles for apparel use, has changed significantly compared with prior to COVID-19 due to changes in lifestyles and consumption brought about by the pandemic.\n\nIn fiscal 2020 , the fibers & textiles business in general had struggled due to the stagnation of the global economy. However, under the MediumTerm Management Program, Project AP-G 2022 (AP-G 2022) basic policies of the Fibers & Textiles Division-continuously strengthen the business structure;  expand  in  growth  regions  and  growth  business  fields;  and enhance profitability by promoting a differentiation strategy and addressing sustainability-in the nonwoven fabric business, we responded to growing demand in the field of masks and protective clothing and also commenced operations at new PP spunbond bases in China and India. Also, we steadily addressed sustainability issues, such as our efforts with the &+ TM brand that makes use of recycled polyester (PET) bottles.\n\nIn fiscal 2021 , the challenges of the Fibers & Textiles Division are to capture demand that is recovering on a global basis and to return to the growth trajectory that the Division was aiming for under the medium-term management program, by accurately responding to new market needs in an era in which the Company coexists with COVID-19. We will continue to promote AP-G 2022 initiatives such as business expansion in growth business fields and regions and enhancement of profitability by promoting a differentiation strategy, driven by airbags, nonwoven fabrics, nonwoven material created using ultra-fine fibers, and integrated business from fiber to textiles and further to garments. Also, we will promote business expansion by addressing sustainability, by the expansion of the GR businesses, which are centered on energy saving materials, biomass, and recycling, to help address global environmental problems, and the LI businesses centered on the medical and healthcare fields.\n\nTo all shareholders and investors :  Going forward, by freely utilizing and combining the strengths of Toray's fibers & textiles business of (1) technological development capabilities and variety of products; (2) customer responsiveness in supply chains comprising of fibers, textiles, and garments; and (3) global business network, we will provide solutions to our customers and aim for sustainable growth that adapts to changes in the world through the world's only 'three-dimensional business development.'",

Previously, the films from electronic components had been mainly treated as  waste  or  used  in  thermal  recycling.  Now,  by  combining mechanical recycling* process technology, which removes a wide variety of coating materials and resins from film surfaces, with foreign matter removal technology for each manufacturing process, Toray is able to reuse the material in films without impairing its mechanical characteristics or reliability. Toray then collaborated with supply chain companies, built a system to collect and reuse used PET film from electronic component applications and commenced operations. This series of environmentally-friendly PET films could help to lower the consumption of raw materials derived from fossil fuels and waste plastics while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 50% compared with conventional Toray products.\n\n- * A physical recycling method for recycling after crushing and cleaning plastic.",

One of the companies spearheading the quest to develop Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles, which are referred to as 'flying cars,' Lilium is aiming to start commercial operations in 2025. They are promoting the development of the small, all-electric, five-seat, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft Lilium Jet that will fly at speeds of 300 km/h or more. Carbon fiber composite materials will be employed for its fuselage, main wings, rotor vanes, and other structural components. In addition, Toray Advanced Composites, a Toray subsidiary, has signed a longterm supply contract for carbon fiber composite materials for the UAM being developed by Joby Aviation, Inc. in the U.S.A. This is also a small, all-electric, five-seat VTOL aircraft that will fly at speeds of 300 km/h or more. Carbon fiber composites are being used, for example, in its structures, propulsion system, and interior parts, with the goal of starting commercial operations in 2023 at the earliest. UAMs are expected to provide a new transportation system that will help to resolve the problems of traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution in urban areas. Toray is working on the development of innovative composite materials to enhance performance, conserve energy, and lower the cost of these 'flying cars' while deepening its collaboration with their manufacturers.",

When newly constructing a seawater desalination plant, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is taken into consideration, and there are increasing cases of the reverse osmosis (RO) membrane method being adopted over the distillation method, which consumes large amounts of energy. Under such circumstances, in addition to its track record, Toray was highly evaluated for its technical proposals necessary for stable operation. For the Al Dur 2 Desalination Plant  in  the  Kingdom  of  Bahrain  and  the  Umm  Al  Quwain Desalination Plant in the United Arab Emirates, Toray received orders for RO membrane that will generate large-scale water production said to total 911,000 m 3 /day. Umm Al Quwain is one of the world's largest seawater desalination plants using the RO membrane method. Product supply and technical services will be provided by Toray Membrane Middle East LLC (TMME), the Toray Group's local subsidiary. The plants are scheduled to commence operations in 2022.",

In the early months of fiscal 2021, market conditions gradually recovered, mainly in China, Europe, and the U.S.A. Although risk factors remain, such as the spread of COVID-19 variants and soaring raw material prices, there is no change in the trend of strong demand for water treatment membranes in the medium- to long- term.\n\nMain initiatives: In our main business, reverse osmosis (RO) membrane business, we will increase our RO membrane production capacity by 1.7 times during the course of the medium-term management program. This increase comes against the backdrop of growing demand in China, where environmental regulations are becoming more stringent, and in the Middle East, where large-scale seawater desalination plants continue to be built. Our aim is to significantly increase revenue and profits and secure the No. 1 share of the global market through full production and maximum sales expansion. At the same time, we will thoroughly strengthen our competitiveness by continuously launching new high-performance products, promoting cost reductions, and building a strong supply chain. In both the Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane and Membrane Bio Reactor (MBR) module businesses, we will expand sales of new high-performance products launched in fiscal 2019 and reinforce our business foundation.\n\nMedium-term management program: We are aggressively operating the business in line with the basic policies and promoting business expansion as planned. In the RO membrane business in fiscal 2020, we achieved significant year-on-year increases in revenue and profits-in an environment in which the global market was shrinking-by making full use of production capacity that had been expanded 1.3 times from the previous fiscal year and by supplying high-performance membranes to large desalination project applications in the Middle East. In the UF and MBR membrane businesses, Toray is further strengthening our global sales structure and promoting sales expansion of new products as planned.\n\nTo all shareholders and investors: Toray's water treatment business has been helping to solve water shortages and reduce environmental impact by developing the world's most advanced technologies, which are centered on seawater desalination and wastewater reuse applications. We will continue to expand and meet the diversifying demand for water treatment membranes, while contributing to the realization of a sustainable and prosperous planet Earth by improving water problems.",

This visual reality (VR) content is a high-definition version of the SATAKE-HotBalloon TM catheter procedure manufactured and sold by Toray for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. An estimated 720,000 patients are said to undergo atrial fibrillation in Japan. The treatment generally necessitates advanced operative procedures. A physician inserts a catheter treatment device into the body and uses X-ray fluoroscopy to visually guide the instrument to the treatment site in the heart. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to observe the procedure at facilities that use the HotBalloon TM . In the medical field, there was a need for a tour tool that did not involve the movement of physicians and avoided people crowding in a clinical environment. Under such circumstances, the VR content developed on this occasion provides an opportunity for hands-on learning with a sense of realism-as if the participants were watching the actual operating procedure right next to the physician-wherever and whenever they want and as many times as they like. The VR content fulfills the role of complementing the traditional on-site training at facilities where the physician uses the HotBalloon TM procedure.",

Camifu TM is environmentally-friendly, as one of its constituent polymers is made from recycled materials. The Company also developed the antiviral textile MAKSPEC TM V, which delivers exceptional washing durability  and  wearing  comfort. In addition, Toray has developed LIVMOA TM 4000, a single-use protective clothing that has the breathability to reduce stuffiness inside  clothing  while  protecting wearers from dust and water.\n\n## Performance Chemicals\n\nToray has developed Ultra-Thin and Flexible  Tough  Polymers  which retains  the  outstanding  thermal resistance,  elastic  modulus  and strength  of  polyamide  6  resin, while  delivering  an  exceptional bending  fatigue  resistance  15 times higher than that of conventional polymers. The new material is expected to be used in automobiles, home appliances, and sports equipment with its superior bending fatigue resistance.\n\n86\n\nToray has also created a non-porous separator for lithium-ion secondary batteries (LiBs) using lithium  metal  as  the  anode.  By suppressing lithium dendrites formation and maintaining high ionic conductivity, the non-porous separator  will  increase  the  capacity and enhance the safety of Lithium Metal Anode Batteries.\n\n## Carbon Fiber Composite Materials\n\nToray  has  concluded  an  agreement  with  Lilium  GmbH  of Germany to supply carbon fiber composite materials for the Lilium  Jet  urban  air  mobility (UAM) vehicle that the company is developing. The development of the UAM, which is also referred to as a 'flying car,' is progressing mainly in the small electric motors that will enable vertical takeoff and landing. Toray will help to resolve urban environmental issues by developing carbon  fiber  composite  materials that cater to the unique challenges of UAM applications.\n\nToray  has  also  jointly  developed, with Tokyo-based MODEC, Inc., a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP)-based repair technology for oil and gas floating production, storage  and  offloading  (FPSO) and floating storage and offloading  (FSO)  facilities.  Approval  for the technology as a repair method",

Since the membrane effectively removes viruses and does not reduce water permeability, it can be expected to contribute to safe and economical water supplies-treated with minimal energy at low cost-in a wide range of water treatment fields, from food and beverages to wastewater reuse.\n\n## Life Science\n\nA  new  concept  antibody  drug that is expected to be effective in  treating  many  types  of  cancer,  TRK-950  started  Phase  I clinical  trials  in  the  U.S.A.  and France in March 2017. To date, the drug has been administered to more than 100 patients, and according to reports there have been no safety problems so far. The  drug's  safety  and  efficacy is being confirmed and the aim is to apply for approval as a cancer treatment drug at the earliest possible time.\n\n## Received Display Component of the Year Award for 2020\n\nAt the Society for Information Display (SID*), Toray received Display Industry Awards, the Display Component of the Year Award for its Spectrum Conversion by Organic Phosphor (SCO) sheet. This honor is in recognition of the sheet's significant contribution to the development of the display industry.\n\nToray has developed an organic luminescent material that exhibits sharp emission spectra and successfully commercialized the product. It is the world first organic luminescent material that helps liquid crystal displays to deliver high color gamuts, enabling colorful displays that cannot be rendered by conventional inorganic phosphors. SID highly appreciated the SCO sheet, because the sheet is composed of organic materials with environmentally-friendly technology and thus free of heavy metals and other toxic substances.\n\n- * Founded in 1962, SID is the world's largest academic society for electronic displays.\n\n## Received JCIA Technology Award for Anti-Thrombogenic Artificial Kidney\n\nToray received the 53rd JCIA Technology Award from the Japan  Chemical  Industry  Association  (JCIA)  for  developing and commercializing an anti-thrombogenic artificial kidney. This marked the sixth time for the Company to win that award, the previous occasion having been the 49th in fiscal 2016.\n\nThe need to enhance the anti-thrombogenic performance of artificial kidneys in line with advances in dialysis treatment is growing year by year. Given that situation, Toray was acclaimed for having fully drawn on its nanotechnology and computational chemistry capabilities in succeeding in commercializing an artificial kidney, a polysulfone membrane, with significantly improved anti-thrombogenic properties.\n\nThis development will lead to the commercialization of artificial kidneys to treat not only chronic but also acute renal failure, thereby contributing to improving patients' quality of life (QOL) and ease burdens on medical professionals.",

        "page_content": "## Intellectual Property\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Patents Filed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Patents Held\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Basic Policies on Intellectual Property\n\nToray Group has formulated and executes the  following  four  intellectual  property strategies as its basic policies on intellectual property.\n\n## 1.  Intellectual property strategies, as a part of the strategy trinity, that conform to management principles\n\nToray Group regards intellectual property as one of its vital management resources. We integrate our intellectual property strategies  mutually  and  organically  with  our business strategies and R&D strategies, and as part of this 'trinity,' we designate intellectual property strategies as one of the most important elements of our management strategies.\n\n## 2. Promoting the procurement of rights\n\nIn order to protect Toray Group's products and technologies and to ensure profits in terms of intellectual property, we hold as many useful patent rights as possible and build patent portfolios. At the same time, we are committed to patent rights acquisition made efficient by enhancing the quality of individual patents.\n\n## 3. Respecting the rights of others\n\nToray  has  operated  a  system  for  comprehensively  investigating  the  relations between  its  own  products  and  technologies and patents owned by other companies, and we thoroughly educate employees to prevent infringement on patent rights of other parties.\n\n## 4. Rightful enforcement of our own rights\n\nWhen  Toray  Group's  patent  rights  are infringed upon by another party, we take proper  steps  depending  on  the  circumstances  by  exercising  our  patent  rights, such  as  demanding  that  infringement cease,  receiving  monetary  profits  from licensing, and using our patent rights for cross-licensing with the patent rights of other parties.\n\n## Intellectual Property Strategies in Line with Management Strategies\n\nUnder Toray Group's Medium-Term Management Program, Project AP-G 2022, a medium-term management program was formulated not only for R&D, but also for intellectual property, and the following five measures are promoted.\n\n## 1.  Strengthening Toray Group's intellectual property capabilities to address global business expansion\n\nUnder the guidance of Toray's Executive Vice  President  in  charge,  the  Group  is advancing intellectual property activities through the construction of a framework in which the intellectual property for group companies in and outside of Japan are managed. Particular attention is paid to nurturing group companies that play a central role in respective regions, and to\n\n88\n\nsupporting  group  companies  that  have newly joined the Group.\n\n## 2.  Strategic patent application and building barriers to entry by protecting knowhow\n\nConsidering  the  risk  of  imitations  that arises following the publication of applications, a scheme where barriers to entry are put in place by creatively leveraging patent applications and the protecting our knowhow is reinforced. Moreover, continuous efforts to further boost the quality of patent specifications are made, as well as promotion of initiatives to strengthen patent applications and patenting of rights outside of Japan.\n\n## 3.  Promoting intellectual property strategies that contribute to the longterm corporate vision\n\nIntellectual  property  activities  are  promoted, in order to achieve sound, sustainable growth espoused in the Long-Term Corporate Vision, TORAY VISION 2030.\n\n## 4.  Establishing an environment to support the promotion of efficient intellectual property strategies\n\nBy digitizing and streamlining workflow for business tasks, such as internal and external  contacts,  queries  and  responses,  or the paperwork involved in forms for circular-type consultations, transition to paperless offices and enhancement of efficiency in intellectual property  operations  are promoted.\n\n## 5.  Developing intellectual property-focused human resources\n\nExperts  capable  of  promoting  intellectual property strategies across the Group are  being  developed,  specific  to  business areas and regions. In particular, the Group  is  elevating  the  intellectual  property competency and capabilities of human resources at group companies, including national staff at group companies outside of Japan, while pursuing patent applications and patenting of rights across the Group, and promoting effective and efficient infringement prevention activities.\n\n## Toray Takes Top Spot on Patent Result's Ranking for Fiber, Paper and Pulp Industry\n\nThe  '2020  Ranking  of  Capability  to Prevent Other Companies from Obtaining Patent  Rights,'  published  annually  by Patent Result Co., Ltd., is an advanced patent  application  index  that  compiles the  number  of  patents  by  a  company that were cited as reasons for rejection of another company's patent application in the course of the patent deliberation process, in any particular year. Toray was ranked No. 1 in the fiber, paper and pulp category for the eighth consecutive year. As the same index benchmarks are used, if 'fiber, paper and pulp,' and 'chemicals' categories are treated as a single industry, Toray's ranking becomes No. 3.",

The figures for the year ended March 31, 2020 are restated in accordance with IFRS for comparison and analysis in the following analysis of financial performance, financial position and cash flows.\n\n## 1. Financial performance\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the global economy  was  hit  hard  by  the  novel  coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The stagnation in production and consumption activities as well as the disruption to supply chains caused by the restrictions on international  movement  of  people  and  goods  resulted in  chaos  in  both  Japanese  and  overseas  economies, causing a record-setting drop in the economy. Subsequently, the global economy rebounded around July, as economic activities resumed, initially in China\n\nand followed by the U.S. and Europe. There were times when growth rate slowed, depending on the country,  due  to  restrictions  on  economic  activities caused by the resurgence of COVID-19 infections, but the global economy has been maintaining a recovery trend in general.\n\nUnder such circumstances, Toray Group in May 2020 launched the new medium-term management program  'Project  AP-G  2022'  aimed  at  achieving sound, sustainable growth through the implementation of basic strategies such as global expansion in growth  business  fields,  strengthening  competitiveness, and strengthening the management foundation.\n\nAs a result, consolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2021, declined 9.9% compared with the previous year to \u00a51,883.6 billion, and core operating income fell 28.1% to \u00a590.3 billion. Operating income declined 51.3% to \u00a555.9 billion and profit attributable to owners of parent declined by 45.6% to \u00a545.8 billion as a U.S. subsidiary recorded an impairment loss.\n\nBillions of yen\n\n|                                         | 2020    | 2021    | Year-over-year (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                                 | 2,091.2 | 1,883.6 | (9.9)                |\n| Core operating income *                 | 125.5   | 90.3    | (28.1)               |\n| Operating income                        | 114.7   | 55.9    | (51.3)               |\n| Profit attributable to owners of parent | 84.2    | 45.8    | (45.6)               |\n\nRevenue  for  the  year  ended  March  31,  2021 dropped  in  all  the  reportable  segments  except Environment & Engineering segment compared with the previous year.

Reporting Entity\n\nToray Industries, Inc. (the Company) is a stock company domiciled in Japan and the registered address of its head office is Chuo-ku, Tokyo. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 (from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the Group's interests in associates and joint arrangements. The ultimate parent of the Group is the Company.\n\nThe Group's main businesses include 'Fibers & Textiles,' 'Performance Chemicals,' 'Carbon Fiber Composite Materials,' 'Environment & Engineering' and 'Life Science' businesses (see 'Note 6. Segment Information').\n\n## Note 2. Basis of Preparation\n\n## 1. Statement of compliance with IFRS and matters related to first-time adoption\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) pursuant to Article 93 of the Regulation on Terminology, Forms, and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements (Ministry of Finance Order No. 28 of 1976), as the Group meets the requirements for a 'specified company complying with designated international accounting standards' set forth in Article 1-2 of the regulation. The Group has adopted IFRS starting from the year ended March 31, 2021, and the date of transition to IFRS is April 1, 2019.\n\nUpon transition to IFRS, the Group has applied IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' (IFRS 1). The impact of the transition to IFRS on the Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows is stated in 'Note 38. First-time Adoption.'\n\n## 2. Approval of consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue on June 22, 2021 by Akihiro Nikkaku, President and Representative Member of the Board.\n\n## 3. Basis of measurement\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain items including financial instruments measured at fair value.\n\n## 4. Presentation currency\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen (millions of yen, rounded off to the nearest million yen), which is the Company's functional currency.\n\n## Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements (including the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of transition to IFRS).\n\n## 1. Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared based on uniform accounting policies.\n\n## (1) Subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group from the date on which the Company obtains control over the subsidiaries until the date on which the Company loses that control.",

        "page_content": "All intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealized gains or losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAny changes in the Company's ownership interests in the consolidated subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity as equity attributable to owners of parent.\n\nIf the Company loses control of a subsidiary, the Group measures and recognizes any investment retained at its fair value at the date when control is lost. Any gain or loss resulting from loss of control is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to owners of parent and to non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nIf the fiscal year-end of a subsidiary is not the same as that of the consolidated financial statements, the subsidiary provisionally closes its accounts for consolidation purposes at the fiscal year-end of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (2) Associates\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control in the entity's decision-making on the financial and operating policies. If the Group holds 20 to 50 percent of the voting power of an entity, it is usually presumed that the Group has significant influence.\n\nInvestments in associates are recognized at cost at the date of acquisition and accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the Group obtains significant influence over the associates to the date on which the Group loses that influence.\n\nInvestments in associates include goodwill recognized upon acquisition.\n\n## (3) Joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is an arrangement where decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. For investments in joint operations, the Group recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses according to the Group's shares in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation.\n\n## 2. Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for an acquisition is measured as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred in exchange for control of the acquiree, the liabilities incurred by former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group.\n\nWhen the Group acquires a business, the Group classifies and designates the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of the contractual terms, economic conditions and other pertinent conditions as they exist at the acquisition date. Those assets and liabilities are, in principle, measured at their acquisition-date fair values.\n\nNon-controlling interests in an acquiree are measured at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nThe excess of (a) the aggregate of the consideration for an acquisition, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (b) the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. If (b) is in excess of (a), the gain is recognized in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "Acquisition-related costs incurred in a business combination are recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred.\n\n## 3. Foreign currency translation\n\n## (1) Foreign currency transactions\n\nEach individual entity within the Group has its own functional currency, and their transactions are measured at their own functional currencies.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction or at the rate that approximates the spot exchange rate.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and measured at cost are translated to the functional currency using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation or settlement are recognized in profit or loss. However, exchange differences arising from equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (2) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen using the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, and the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen using the average exchange rate for the reporting period, except in cases where the exchange rate fluctuates significantly. Exchange differences arising from the translation of a foreign operation's financial statements are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences relating to the foreign operation are reclassified to profit or loss for the period of disposal.\n\n## 4. Financial instruments\n\n## (1) Non-derivative financial assets\n\n## (a) Initial recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group initially recognizes trade and other receivables on the date when they arise and other financial assets on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contract.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as either of the followings at initial recognition:\n\n(i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe Group classifies a financial asset as those measured at amortized cost only if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7  the financial asset is held within a business model with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- \u00b7  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n(ii) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThe Group classifies a financial asset as a debt instrument measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7  the financial asset is held within a business model with an objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and\n- \u00b7  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.",

        "page_content": "(iii) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nEquity instruments such as shares held primarily for the purposes of strengthening business relationships with customers and expanding businesses are designated as those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. This designation is applied consistently.\n\n(iv) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets that are not classified as any of the above are classified as those measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nExcept for financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Transaction costs of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as profit or loss.\n\n## (b) Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets are measured based on their classification as follows:\n\n## (i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\n- Such assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n- (ii) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nSuch debt instruments are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, except that foreign exchange gains or losses, impairment losses, and finance income based on the effective interest method are recognized in profit or loss. When these debt instruments are derecognized, cumulative gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss as reclassification adjustments.\n\n(iii) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nSuch equity instruments are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen these equity instruments are derecognized, cumulative gains or losses recognized through other comprehensive income are reclassified from other components of equity to retained earnings. Dividends and interest income from these equity instruments are recognized as finance income in profit or loss.\n\n(iv) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nSuch financial assets are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## (c) Derecognition\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.\n\n## (d) Impairment of financial assets\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts is recognized for expected credit losses in respect of financial assets measured at amortized cost. Accordingly, the Group assesses whether the credit risk on these financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition at the end of each reporting period. If the credit risk on a financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. However, an allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables without any significant financing components is always measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nWhether the credit risk has increased significantly or not is determined mainly based on past due information and credit ratings. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired primarily when there is a substantial delay in payment or a significant financial difficulty of the borrower.\n\nThe expected credit loss is measured by reflecting the time value of money on the difference between the total contractual cash flows that are due to the Group and the total cash flows that the Group expects to receive, and is recognized in profit or loss.",

All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, which are measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## (b) Subsequent measurement\n\n(i) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nSuch liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortization using the effective interest method and gains or losses on derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- (ii) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nSuch financial liabilities are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## (c) Derecognition\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when it is extinguished, i.e., when the obligation specified in the contract is performed, discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## (3) Hedge accounting and derivatives\n\n## (a) Qualifying hedging instruments and hedged items\n\nThe Group enters into derivative transactions, including forward exchange contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to manage currency risk and interest rate risk. As the prerequisite for application of hedge accounting, at the inception of a hedge, the Group formally designates and documents the relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, and its risk management objectives and strategies. The documentation includes concrete items or transactions of hedging instruments and hedged items, the nature of the risks being hedged, and methods to assess effectiveness of hedging relationships. Furthermore, the Group evaluates on an ongoing basis whether a hedging instrument is highly effective during its term in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the relevant hedged item.\n\nDerivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied are classified as 'financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss' or 'financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss' and accounted for based on their classification.\n\n## (b) Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income as cash flow hedges and the cumulative gain or loss is included in other components of equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The portion of the foreign currency basis spread related to cross-currency swaps is excluded from hedging instruments and recognized in other comprehensive income as deferred costs of hedging, and the cumulative amount is included in other components of equity.\n\nThe amount accumulated in other components of equity is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period when the hedged items affect profit or loss. However, if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amount accumulated in other components of equity is accounted for as an adjustment to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.\n\nIf a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or ceases to meet the hedge accounting criteria, the application of hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gain or loss recognized through other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.",

Changes in the fair value of a hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in profit or loss after adjusting the carrying amount of the hedged item. If the hedged item is a financial instrument measured at amortized cost, amortization of the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item begins when the application of hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\n## 5. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 6. Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, and are mainly determined using the moving-average cost method. Net realizable value is determined by the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 7. Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group applies the cost model for measurement of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCosts of property, plant and equipment include costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located, and borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, except for land and construction in progress, are depreciated mainly using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of major items of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings and structures: 3-60 years\n- \u00b7 Machinery and vehicles: 2-20 years\n\nThe depreciation method, useful life and residual value of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each fiscal year-end, and any changes, if necessary, are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting estimates.\n\n## 8. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## (1) Goodwill\n\nThe measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is described in '2. Business combinations.' Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.\n\n## (2) Intangible assets\n\nThe Group applies the cost model for measurement of intangible assets. Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost at initial recognition and those acquired in a business combination are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.\n\nExpenditures generated internally at a research phase are recognized as expenses as incurred. Expenditures generated internally at a development phase are recognized as intangible assets only if all of the requirements for capitalization are met.",

The estimated useful lives of major intangible assets are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer-related intangible assets: 14-21 years\n- \u00b7 Technology-based intangible assets: 8-24 years\n- \u00b7 Software: Mainly 5 years\n\nThe amortization method, useful life and residual value of an intangible asset are reviewed at each fiscal year-end, and any changes, if necessary, are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting estimates.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are not amortized, and are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.\n\n## 9. Leases\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAt the commencement date, a lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. An incremental borrowing rate is used for a discount rate unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined. A right-of-use asset is measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, adjusted by initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments, plus an estimated cost of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which the asset is located.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated mainly over the lease term after the commencement date of the lease. The lease term is determined by adding a period when it is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, to the non-cancellable period of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and repayments of lease liabilities based on the effective interest method.\n\nFor leases with a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the related lease payments are recognized as expenses on a systematic basis over the lease term.\n\n## 10. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that non-financial assets, including property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. For goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use, their recoverable amounts are estimated annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use. When the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be estimated, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The value in use is determined as the discounted present value of future cash flows to be derived from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal. The discount rate used for determining the value in use is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset, a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for a cash-generating unit (group of units) is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit (group of units) and is then allocated to the other assets pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the individual asset or cash-generating unit is estimated. If the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, impairment losses are reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the lower of its recoverable amount determined and the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been",

Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. When the effect of the time value of money is material, a provision is measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate used for determining the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## 12. Employee benefits\n\n## (1) Post-employment benefits\n\nThe Group has defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans as retirement benefit plans for employees. (a) Defined contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expenses when services are rendered by employees.\n\n## (b) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe present value of defined benefit obligations and current service cost, as well as past service costs are determined using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate is determined based on market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds for the corresponding period up to the estimated date of future benefit payments.\n\nThe net defined benefit liability (asset) is recognized at the present value of defined benefit obligations net of the fair value of plan assets.\n\nService costs and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized in profit or loss. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period when they occur and transferred immediately to retained earnings. Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period when they are incurred.\n\n## (2) Other employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are recognized as expenses when the associated services are rendered by employees at undiscounted amounts.\n\nWhen the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to make payments of bonuses and paid leave expenses and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation, a liability is recognized for the estimated amount to be paid based on the respective programs.\n\n## 13. Equity\n\nCommon shares are recorded at issue value in share capital and capital surplus.\n\nTreasury shares are valued at cost and deducted from equity. When treasury shares are disposed of, the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received is recognized as capital surplus.\n\n## 14. Share-based payments\n\nThe Company has adopted a share option plan as an equity-settled share-based remuneration plan. The grant-date fair value of share options is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, and the corresponding amount is recognized as an increase in equity. The fair value of options granted is determined using the Black-Scholes model.",

Revenue recognition\n\nThe Group's revenue is recognized based on the following five-step model:\n\n- Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer\n- Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n- Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n- Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation\n\nThe Group operates Fibers & Textiles, Performance Chemicals, Carbon Fiber Composite Materials, Environment & Engineering, Life Science and other businesses and, with regard to sales of products of these businesses, the Group determines that its performance obligation is satisfied typically when a customer obtains control of the product upon the delivery. Accordingly, revenue is mainly recognized when the product is delivered. For engineering and other service contracts at certain subsidiaries operating the Environment & Engineering business, revenue is recognized over time based on the progress in satisfying the performance obligation because control of a product or service is transferred over time. The progress is measured by a ratio of the actual cost to the total estimated cost.\n\nRevenue is recognized at the consideration promised in a contract with a customer, less discounts, rebates, returned products and other items, and only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. In addition, contracts do not contain a significant financing component because consideration is normally collected about within one year from the time when the performance obligation is satisfied.\n\n## 16. Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes consist of current taxes and deferred taxes. They are recognized in profit or loss, except for those related to business combinations and items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent taxes are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the accounting carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities and for the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses at the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are, in principle, recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized, and the recoverability of deferred tax assets is reassessed each period.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized for the following temporary differences:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u00b7  temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in transactions (excluding business combinations) which affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit;\n- \u00b7  taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent that the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7  deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent that it is not probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future or it is not probable that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.\n\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns.",

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares.\n\n## Note 4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best judgements, but may differ from actual results.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effects of revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in future periods.\n\nAccounting judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in the Group's consolidated financial statements are principally as follows:\n\n## 1. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that non-financial assets, including property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. For goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use, their recoverable amounts are estimated annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment.\n\nIn determining the recoverable amount, certain assumptions are established for future cash flows, discount rates and other items. These assumptions are determined by management's best estimates and judgements but may be affected by changes in future economic conditions and business plans. If it becomes necessary to review the assumptions, the consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.\n\nThe relevant details are described in 'Note 10. Property, Plant and Equipment' and 'Note 12. Goodwill and Intangible Assets.'\n\n## 2. Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized, and their recoverability is reviewed every period. In determining the recoverability, the amount and timing of taxable profit generated are estimated based on business plans. These assumptions are determined by management's best estimates and judgements but may be affected by changes in future economic conditions and other events. If it becomes necessary to review the assumptions, the consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.\n\nThe relevant details are described in 'Note 17. Income Taxes.'\n\n## 3. Measurement of defined benefit obligations\n\nThe net defined benefit liability (asset) is recognized at the present value of defined benefit obligations net of the fair value of plan assets. Defined benefit obligations are calculated based on actuarial assumptions, which include estimates of discount rates, employee turnover, mortality and future increases in salaries. These actuarial assumptions may be affected by changes in future economic climates or social conditions. If it becomes necessary to review the assumptions, the consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.\n\nThe relevant details are described in 'Note 21. Employee Benefits.'",

(currently Toray TCAC Holding B.V.), which were acquired in July 2018.

Impairment tests for goodwill\n\nCash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment. The carrying amounts of material goodwill are as follows:\n\n| Reportable segment                | Cash-generating unit or group  of cash-generating units   | April 1, 2019   | March 31, 2020   | March 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Carbon Fiber Composite  Materials | Toray TCAC Holding B.V.                                   | 60,459          | 59,285           | 60,309           |\n| Carbon Fiber Composite  Materials | Zoltek Companies, Inc.                                    | 11,610          | 11,384           | 11,580           |\n\nMillions of yen\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit was measured at value in use. The value in use was determined based on the business plan for the next five years approved by management combined with a terminal value, reflecting past experience and external information. The business plan is primarily affected by changes in sales volumes and sales prices. The terminal value was calculated using the growth rate based on the expected inflation rate of the country to which the cash-generating unit belonged (2.2 to 2.3% at April 1, 2019, March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021). The discount rate used in the measurement of value in use was 8.1 to 8.3% at April 1, 2019, March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021.\n\nAs the recoverable amount is sufficiently higher than the carrying amount, it is considered unlikely that a significant impairment loss would be incurred even if the key assumptions used in the impairment test were to change within a reasonably foreseeable range.\n\n## Note 13. Impairment Losses\n\nThe Group generally identifies cash-generating units on the basis of management accounting segmentation.\n\nThe major assets for which impairment losses were recognized for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 are as follows. The impairment losses are recorded in 'Other expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n| 2020                   | 2020                                 | 2020                                 | 2020                         | 2020                                 |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Reportable segment     | Location                             | Use                                  | Class of asset               | Impairment losses  (Millions of yen) |\n| Carbon Fiber           | Markgr\u00f6ningen,                       | Carbon fiber                         | Machinery and vehicles       | 905                                  |\n| Composite Materials    | Germany and other                    | composite materials                  | Construction in progress     | 180                                  |\n|                        |                                      | production facilities                | Other                        | 645                                  |\n| Performance  Chemicals | Gyeongsangbuk-do,  Republic of Korea | Film production  facilities          | Machinery and vehicles Other | 1,331 4                              |\n| Performance  Chemicals | Saint-Maurice-de- Beynost, France    | Film production  facilities          | Machinery and vehicles       | 1,266                                |\n| -                      | Tokai, Aichi, Japan                  | Research and  development facilities | Machinery and vehicles       | 1,031                                |",

The value in use was calculated by discounting the future cash flows at discount rates of 7.4 to 10.2%.\n\n|                                    | 2021                          | 2021                                                     | 2021                                                                     | 2021                                 |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Reportable segment                 | Location                      | Use                                                      | Class of asset                                                           | Impairment losses  (Millions of yen) |\n| Carbon Fiber  Composite  Materials | Washington,  U.S.A. and other | Carbon fiber  composite materials  production facilities | Buildings and structures Machinery and vehicles Construction in progress | 9,844                                |\n| Carbon Fiber  Composite  Materials | Washington,  U.S.A. and other | Carbon fiber  composite materials  production facilities | Buildings and structures Machinery and vehicles Construction in progress | 14,275                               |\n| Carbon Fiber  Composite  Materials | Washington,  U.S.A. and other | Carbon fiber  composite materials  production facilities | Other                                                                    | 313                                  |\n| Carbon Fiber  Composite  Materials | Washington,  U.S.A. and other | Carbon fiber  composite materials  production facilities | Other                                                                    | 536                                  |\n| Fibers &  Textiles                 | Penang,  Malaysia             | Fiber production  facilities                             | Buildings and structures                                                 | 225                                  |\n| Fibers &  Textiles                 | Penang,  Malaysia             | Fiber production  facilities                             | Machinery and vehicles                                                   | 1,589                                |\n| Fibers &  Textiles                 | Penang,  Malaysia             | Fiber production  facilities                             | Other                                                                    | 21                                   |\n\nThe carrying amounts of, mainly, operating assets with declining profitability were reduced to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount was measured at value in use. The value in use was calculated by discounting the future cash flows at discount rates of 7.8 to 9.0%.\n\nThe carrying amount of the carbon fiber composite materials production facilities in Washington, U.S.A. and other was reduced to the recoverable amount due to a decline in profitability caused by sluggish demand for aircraft, and the recoverable amount was measured at value in use of \u00a553,192 million. The value in use was calculated by discounting the future cash flows at a discount rate of 7.8%. The future cash flows were estimated based on the business plan for the next five years approved by management, reflecting past experience and external information, and for the years after the five years, estimated using the growth rate based on the expected inflation rate of the country to which the cash-generating unit belongs. The business plan is primarily affected by changes in sales volumes and sales prices.\n\n## Note 14. Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\n## 1.

The directors of the Fund and the pension fund trustee are required by laws and regulations to faithfully perform their duties for the Fund, and are responsible for managing the plan assets based on the prescribed policies. The amount of contributions to the defined benefit plan is reviewed regularly through financial recalculations to ensure that the pension plan maintains financial balance into the future. With respect to the investment of plan assets in the Fund, it seeks to secure the required total return over the long term with the aim of ensuring the payment of pension benefits and lump-sum benefits to the participants into the future. In addition, the Fund gives full consideration to the mediumto long-term trends in the ratio of income, including contributions, to expenditure, including benefit payments, as well as the impact of uncertainty in the plan assets on the financial balance of the pension plan and the degree of acceptable uncertainty in the rate of return on the plan assets.",

Share-based Payments\n\n## 1. Overview of share option plan\n\nThe Company has introduced a share compensation-type share option plan (share acquisition rights) for the Company's members of the Board, vice presidents, executive fellows and directors to enhance their motivation and willingness to improve the Group's performance and to promote sharing of share price benefits with the shareholders.\n\nThe share acquisition rights allocated under this plan are vested depending on the number of months in office during the specified service period. Holders of share acquisition rights may exercise their rights only within ten days after the day on which they lose any of their positions as a member of the Board, vice president, executive fellow or director of the Company.\n\nThe Company's share option plan is accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction. The amounts of expenses recognized for the plan were \u00a5325 million and \u00a5355 million for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.",

Risks arising from financial instruments\n\nThe Group conducts risk management based on the following policies to respond to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from financial instruments.\n\n## (1) Credit risk management\n\nTrade receivables of the Group are exposed to customer credit risk. In order to mitigate the risk, under its internal regulations, the Company carefully manages the due dates and outstanding balances of receivables from each customer and regularly monitors the credit standing of major customers. Consolidated subsidiaries also monitor and manage the credit standings of their customers. The Group is not exposed to any credit risk that is excessively concentrated on particular counterparties.\n\n## (a) Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk at each fiscal year-end is the carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment. With regard to guarantee obligations, the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is the balance of guarantee obligations shown in 'Note 36.

To mitigate the risk, the Group procures funds by determining the best timing, size and instruments after comprehensively taking into consideration the projected fund needs and the financial market trends. The Group also takes measures for effective use of excess cash within the Group by using the cash management system. In addition, the liquidity risk is managed by monitoring projected and actual cash flows. At the same time, to prepare for the urgent fund needs due to deterioration in operating results and cash flows and for the financial market turmoil, the Group secures liquidity by concluding overdraft agreements and other credit facilities with domestic and overseas financial institutions.\n\nThe analysis of undiscounted contractual cash flows of financial liabilities by maturity is as follows:\n\nMillions of yen\n\n|                                       | 1 year or  less   | Over 1 year  to 2 years   | Over 2 years  to 3 years   | Over 3 years  to 4 years   | Over 4 years  to 5 years   | Over  5 years   | Total             |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Non-derivative financial  liabilities |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |                   |\n| Trade and other  payables             | 325,569           | -                         | -                          | -                          | -                          | -               | 325,569           |\n| Bonds and borrowings                  | 306,215           | 132,468                   | 82,112                     | 88,301                     | 112,362                    |                 | 319,086 1,040,544 |\n| Lease liabilities                     | 10,940            | 9,034                     | 7,600                      | 4,500                      | 2,570                      | 11,774          | 46,418            |\n| Other financial liabilities           |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |                   |\n| Deposits received                     | 16,094            | -                         | -                          | -                          | -                          | -               | 16,094            |\n| Derivative financial  liabilities     |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |                   |\n| Other financial liabilities           |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |                   |\n| Derivative liabilities                | 7                 | (138)                     | (485)                      | (483)                      | (488)                      | 5,381           | 3,794             |\n\nMillions of yen\n\n|                                               | 1 year or  less   | Over 1 year  to 2 years   | Over 2 years  to 3 years   | Over 3 years  to 4 years   | Over 4 years  to 5 years   | Over  5 years   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|---------|\n| Non-derivative financial  liabilities         |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |         |\n| Trade and other  payables                     | 285,702           | -                         | -                          | -                          | -                          | -               | 285,702 |\n| Bonds and borrowings                          | 285,890           | 104,966                   | 99,172                     | 110,805                    | 51,970                     | 326,477         | 979,280 |\n| Lease liabilities                             | 10,525            | 8,695                     | 4,995                      | 2,811                      | 2,322                      | 10,005          | 39,353  |\n| Other financial liabilities Deposits received | 12,385            | -                         | -                          | -                          | -                          | -               | 12,385  |\n| Derivative financial  liabilities             |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |         |\n| Other financial liabilities                   |                   |                           |                            |                            |                            |                 |         |\n| Derivative liabilities                        | 781               | (89)                      | (100)                      | (136)                      | (172)                      | 4,289           | 4,573   |",

Major market risks that the Group is exposed to include currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk. In order to mitigate these risks, the Group uses derivative transactions such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps as necessary. Derivative transactions are executed and managed in accordance with internal regulations prescribing the authorizations for transactions. In addition, the Group carries out derivative transactions only with financial institutions with a high credit rating in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with derivative transactions. The Group uses derivatives only for hedging market risks and does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n## (a) Currency risk\n\nTrade receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies that arise from the Group's global business operations are exposed to the foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Group hedges this risk mainly through the use of forward exchange contracts against net positions of receivables and payables denominated in the same foreign currencies. Likewise, the Group mainly uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nFor financial instruments held by the Group at March 31, 2020 and 2021, the impact of a 1% appreciation of each currency against the functional currencies on 'Profit before tax' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss is as follows. The effects of translating financial instruments denominated in the functional currencies and the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of foreign operations into yen are not included. In addition, it is assumed that currencies other than that used in the calculation do not fluctuate and assumed that other variable factors remain constant.\n\nMillions of yen\n\n|                             |   March 31, 2020 |   March 31, 2021 |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Impact on profit before tax |               68 |               16 |",

Those with floating rates bear the risk of higher nominal interest expenses when market interest rates rise, whereas those with fixed rates bear the risk of higher real interest expenses when market interest rates fall. The Group uses interest rate swaps as necessary to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuation, taking into consideration the balance between fixed-rate liabilities and floating-rate liabilities.\n\nFor interest-bearing liabilities with floating interest rates held by the Group at March 31, 2020 and 2021, the impact of a 1% increase in interest rates at the end of the period on 'Profit before tax' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss is as follows.

These shares are exposed to stock price fluctuation risk. The Group regularly monitors the financial positions of the issuing entities and reviews holding status by taking into consideration the relationships with customers. These are designated as equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and therefore there is no impact on profit or loss arising from stock price fluctuations.\n\n## 3. Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## (1) Fair value hierarchy of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is categorized from Level 1 to Level 3 as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Fair value measured by quoted prices in active markets\n\nLevel 2: Fair value calculated, directly or indirectly, using observable prices other than Level 1\n\nLevel 3: Fair value calculated using valuation techniques including inputs not based on observable market data\n\nTransfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized as if they have occurred at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\n## (2) Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost\n\nThe following table compares the fair value and the carrying amount of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. Financial instruments whose carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value and financial instruments with low materiality are not included in the following table.\n\nMillions of yen\n\n|                       | April 1, 2019    | April 1, 2019   | March 31, 2020   | March 31, 2020   | March 31, 2021   | March 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | Carrying  amount | Fair value      | Carrying  amount | Fair value       | Carrying  amount | Fair value       |\n| Financial liabilities |                  |                 |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Bonds and  borrowings |                  |                 |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Bonds payable         | 340,107          | 342,788         | 290,187          | 290,682          | 290,158          | 291,255          |\n| Long-term  borrowings | 466,917          | 466,645         | 498,588          | 500,227          | 469,993          | 468,489          |\n| Total                 | 807,024          | 809,433         | 788,775          | 790,909          | 760,151          | 759,744          |\n\n- * The fair value of the above financial instruments is categorized within Level 2.",

Hedge accounting\n\n## (1) Overview of hedges\n\nThe Group enters into derivative transactions to reduce currency risk and interest rate risk, and applies hedge accounting to those that qualify as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Cash flow hedges are used primarily to reduce the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows related to forecast transactions and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and borrowings with floating interest rates. Fair value hedges are used to convert the interest rates on borrowings to floating interest rates and accordingly reduce the risk of changes in the fair value of such borrowings.\n\nThe currency basis spread of a cross-currency swap used to reduce currency risk is excluded from the hedging instrument and recognized as a deferred cost of hedging in other comprehensive income. In addition, in applying hedge accounting, in principle, since the important conditions such as the quantity, term, and benchmark interest rate for the hedged items and the hedging instruments are made almost the same, the ineffective portion of hedging is immaterial.\n\n## (2) Information on items designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe nominal amount and its timing and the carrying amount of hedging instruments are as follows:\n\nMillions of yenMillions of yen\n\n|                            | April 1, 2019   | April 1, 2019   | April 1, 2019                | April 1, 2019                |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                            | Nominal amount  | Of which due    | Carrying amount (fair value) | Carrying amount (fair value) |\n|                            |                 | over 1 year     | Assets                       | Liabilities                  |\n| Cash flow hedges           |                 |                 |                              |                              |\n| Currency risk              |                 |                 |                              |                              |\n| Forward exchange contracts | 30,334          | 40              | 186                          | 99                           |\n| Cross-currency swaps       | 142,071         | 138,425         | 13,102                       | 2,827                        |\n| Interest rate risk         |                 |                 |                              |                              |\n| Interest rate swaps        | 40,504          | 40,000          | 29                           | -                            |\n| Fair value hedges          |                 |                 |                              |                              |\n| Interest rate risk         |                 |                 |                              |                              |\n| Interest rate swaps        | 66,900          | 66,900          | 1,975                        | -                            |\n\n|                                           | March 31, 2020   | March 31, 2020   | March 31, 2020               | March 31, 2020               |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                           | Nominal amount   | Of which due     | Carrying amount (fair value) | Carrying amount (fair value) |\n|                                           |                  | over 1 year      | Assets                       | Liabilities                  |\n| Cash flow hedges                          |                  |                  |                              |                              |\n| Currency risk                             |                  |                  |                              |                              |\n| Forward exchange contracts                | 52,471           | -                | 300                          | 81                           |\n| Cross-currency swaps *1                   | 137,269          | 87,618           | 10,953                       | 3,319                        |\n| Interest rate risk Interest rate swaps *2 | 100,271          | 59,785           | 223                          | -                            |\n| Fair value hedges                         |                  |                  |                              |                              |\n| Interest rate risk Interest rate swaps    | 26,900           | 26,900           | 186                          | -                            |",

Of these hedging relationships, those with maturity dates subsequent to the date of cessation of LIBOR publication are subject to uncertainties arising from the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group assumes that uncertainties will exist until an alternative benchmark rate is determined and the cash flows based on the benchmark rate are confirmed. The nominal amount of the hedging instruments related to the affected hedging relationships was \u00a5172,585 million at March 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe Group is working with the financial institutions involved in such floating rate liabilities and hedging transactions to prepare for the transition to an alternative benchmark rate.",

The most recent consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Japan (J-GAAP) are for the year ended March 31, 2020, and the date of transition to IFRS is April 1, 2019.\n\n## 1. Exemptions from retrospective application\n\nIFRS 1 requires in principle that first-time adopters retrospectively apply IFRS, but exceptionally permits exemptions from retrospective application for certain standards. The exemptions that the Group has adopted are as follows:\n\n## (1) Business combinations\n\nUnder IFRS 1, first-time adopters may elect not to apply IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' (IFRS 3) retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS. Adopting this exemption, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before April 1, 2019. As a result, the carrying amount of goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before April 1, 2019 is based on the carrying amount in accordance with J-GAAP at that date. The goodwill was tested for impairment at April 1, 2019 regardless of whether there was an indication of impairment.\n\n## (2) Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n\nUnder IFRS 1, first-time adopters may elect to deem the cumulative exchange differences on translation of foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS. The Group has elected to deem the cumulative exchange differences on translation of foreign operations to be zero at April 1, 2019.\n\n## (3) Leases\n\nUnder IFRS 1, first-time adopters may assess whether a contract existing at the date of transition to IFRS contains a lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at that date. In addition, when recognizing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, first-time adopters may measure the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at the date of transition to IFRS.\n\nAdopting this exemption, the Group has assessed whether a contract existing at April 1, 2019 contains a lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at that date. In addition, except for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the Group has measured the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments at April 1, 2019, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at that date, and the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability.\n\n## (4) Designation of financial instruments recognized before the date of transition to IFRS\n\nUnder IFRS 1, first-time adopters should determine the classification under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9) on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of transition to IFRS rather than at the date of initial recognition, and may designate investments in equity instruments as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at that date. The Group has determined the classification under IFRS 9 on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at April 1, 2019, and has designated investments in equity instruments as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## 2. Reconciliations\n\nThe effects of the transition from J-GAAP to IFRS on the Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows are as follows. In these reconciliations, 'Reclassification' mainly includes items that affect neither retained earnings nor comprehensive income, and 'Recognition and measurement difference' mainly includes items that affect retained earnings and comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "## Notes on reconciliation of equity\n\n## (1) Revenue recognition\n\n## (a)  Change in timing of revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from sale of goods transactions that was recognized upon shipment under J-GAAP is recognized upon delivery of goods under IFRS. As a result of this change, 'Trade and other receivables' have decreased, and 'Inventories' have increased.\n\n## (b) Repurchase agreements in processing contracts\n\nUnder J-GAAP, products and materials (inventories) supplied to contractors for a fee in a contract where the goods supplied are processed and sold back to the Group were derecognized at the time of supply to the processors. Under IFRS, such transactions are deemed as financing transactions, under which 'Inventories' continue to be recognized and 'Other financial liabilities' (current liabilities) are recognized.\n\n## (c)  Construction contracts\n\nConstruction contracts that were accounted for using the completed contract method under J-GAAP are accounted for using the cost recovery method under IFRS. Accordingly, 'Inventories' have decreased, and 'Trade and other receivables' have increased.\n\n## (2) Leases\n\nUnder J-GAAP, a lessee classified leases as either a finance lease or an operating lease and accounted for operating leases using the accounting method similar to that for ordinary rental transactions. Under IFRS, instead of making such classification, a lessee recognizes 'Right-of-use assets' and 'Lease liabilities' for all leases except for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.\n\n## (3) Goodwill\n\nUnder J-GAAP, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over a period for which goodwill is expected to have an effect with a maximum period of 20 years after recognition. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortized. Accordingly, 'Goodwill' increased at March 31, 2020.\n\n## (4) Retirement benefits\n\nAs a result of remeasuring defined benefit obligations based on the discount rate and other assumptions in accordance with IFRS, 'Retirement benefit asset' has decreased, and 'Retirement benefit liability' has increased. Under J-GAAP, actuarial gains and losses were recognized in other comprehensive income as incurred and subsequently expensed over a certain number of years within the average remaining service period of employees. Under IFRS, remeasurements of defined benefit plans including actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income as incurred and immediately reclassified to retained earnings.\n\n## (5) Unused paid absences\n\nUnused paid absences of employees, which were not required to be recognized as liabilities under J-GAAP, are recognized as liabilities under IFRS. As a result, 'Other current liabilities' have increased.\n\n## (6) Financial instruments\n\n## (a)  Notes maturing at the fiscal year end and cash settlements due on the fiscal year end\n\nUnder J-GAAP, notes maturing at the fiscal year end and cash settlements (limited to those settled on the same terms and conditions as notes) due on the fiscal year end were accounted for as if they had been settled at the maturity date even when the fiscal year end fell on a bank holiday. Under IFRS, they are derecognized on the actual clearing or settlement date. As a result of this change, 'Cash and cash equivalents' have decreased, and 'Trade and other receivables' and 'Trade and other payables' have increased.",

        "page_content": "## (b) Accounts receivable factoring and securitization\n\nOf factored or securitized receivables that were derecognized at the time of transfer under J-GAAP, those that do not qualify for derecognition under IFRS are not derecognized and the considerations received are recognized as borrowings. As a result, 'Trade and other receivables' and 'Bonds and borrowings' (current liabilities) have increased.\n\n## (c)  Valuation of unlisted equity securities\n\nUnlisted equity securities were stated at cost using the moving-average cost method under J-GAAP, but are stated at fair value under IFRS. As a result, 'Other financial assets' (non-current assets) and 'Other components of equity' have increased.\n\n## (d) Cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps\n\nIn applying hedge accounting, cross-currency swaps were accounted for using the allocation method and interest rate swaps were accounted for using the special accounting method under J-GAAP. Under IFRS, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps are accounted for using the cash flow hedge method or the fair value hedge method. Accordingly, 'Other financial assets' (current assets and non-current assets), 'Bonds and borrowings' and 'Other financial liabilities' (non-current liabilities) have increased.\n\n## (e)  Bonds payable (bond issuance costs, convertible bonds)\n\nBond issuance costs, which were expensed as incurred under J-GAAP, are deducted from the carrying amount of the bonds and expensed using the effective interest method under IFRS. Convertible bonds, which were recognized as liabilities in their entirety under J-GAAP, are separated into the bond component, which is recognized as a liability, and the share acquisition right component, which is recognized as an equity, under IFRS. As a result, 'Bonds and borrowings' have decreased, and 'Capital surplus' has increased.\n\n## (7) Equity method\n\n## (a)  Change in scope of application of equity method\n\nCertain entities that were excluded from the scope of equity method in view of their immateriality at March 31, 2019 under J-GAAP are included in the scope of equity method effective from the date of transition to IFRS. As a result, 'Investments accounted for using equity method' have increased at April 1, 2019. These entities are also included in the scope of equity method effective from the beginning of the year ended March 31, 2020 under J-GAAP.\n\n## (b) Equity method goodwill\n\nEquity method goodwill, which was amortized under J-GAAP, is not amortized under IFRS. Accordingly, 'Investments accounted for using equity method' have increased at March 31, 2020.\n\n## (8) Tax effects\n\nTax effects of the elimination of unrealized gains and losses were determined using the tax rates of sellers under J-GAAP, but are determined using the tax rates of buyers under IFRS. The recoverability is also reassessed under IFRS. In addition, the amounts of 'Deferred tax assets' and 'Deferred tax liabilities' have been adjusted for temporary differences as a result of the reconciliation from J-GAAP to IFRS.\n\n## (9) Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n\nAs a result of applying the exemptions provided in IFRS 1, the cumulative exchange differences on translation of foreign operations were all reclassified to retained earnings at April 1, 2019.",

In addition, revenue from sale of goods transactions that was recognized upon shipment under J-GAAP is recognized upon delivery of goods under IFRS. As a result of these adjustments, 'Revenue' has decreased.\n\n## (2) Goodwill\n\nUnder J-GAAP, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over a period for which goodwill is expected to have an effect with a maximum period of 20 years after recognition. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortized. Accordingly, 'Selling, general and administrative expenses' have decreased.",

        "page_content": "## (3) Retirement benefits\n\nUnder J-GAAP, actuarial gains and losses were recognized in other comprehensive income as incurred, subsequently amortized over a certain number of years within the average remaining service period of employees and recognized in profit or loss. Under IFRS, remeasurements of defined benefit plans including actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income as incurred and immediately reclassified to retained earnings. As a result, 'Cost of sales' and 'Selling, general and administrative expenses' have been adjusted.\n\n## (4) Financial instruments\n\nUnder J-GAAP, gains and losses on sale and impairment losses of investments in equity instruments were recognized in profit or loss. Under IFRS, for investments in equity instruments designated as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the amount of changes in the fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income, and reclassified to retained earnings at the time of sale. Accordingly, 'Finance income' and 'Finance costs' have decreased.\n\n## (5) Equity method goodwill\n\nEquity method goodwill, which was amortized under J-GAAP, is not amortized under IFRS. Accordingly, 'Share of profit of investments accounted for using equity method' has increased.\n\n## (6) Tax effects\n\nAs a result of temporary differences arising from the reconciliation from J-GAAP to IFRS, the amount of income taxes has been adjusted.\n\nTax effects of the elimination of unrealized gains and losses, which were determined using the tax rates of sellers under J-GAAP, are determined using the tax rates of buyers under IFRS.\n\n## (7) Reclassifications\n\nIn addition to the above, the Group has made certain reclassifications to comply with the provisions of IFRS. The major items of the reclassifications are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  'Expenses related to start-up of new facilities' and 'Expenses related to idle facilities,' which were presented in 'Non-operating expenses' under J-GAAP, are included in 'Selling, general and administrative expenses' and 'Cost of sales,' respectively, under IFRS. Of the other items that were presented in 'Non-operating income,' 'Non-operating expenses,' 'Special gains' and 'Special losses' under J-GAAP, finance-related items and foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in 'Finance income' or 'Finance costs,' gains and losses related to the equity method in 'Share of profit of investments accounted for using equity method' and other items in 'Other income' or 'Other expenses.'\n\n## III.  Reconciliation of cash flows\n\nMain differences between the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with J-GAAP and that in accordance with IFRS for the year ended March 31, 2020 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Under J-GAAP, notes maturing at the fiscal year end and cash settlements (limited to those settled on the same terms and conditions as notes) due on the fiscal year end were accounted for as if they had been settled at the maturity date even when the fiscal year end fell on a bank holiday. Under IFRS, they are derecognized on the actual clearing or settlement date. As a result of this change, 'Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period' have decreased, and 'Cash flows from operating activities' have increased.\n- \u00b7  Lease payments for operating leases, which were classified in 'Cash flows from operating activities' under J-GAAP, are classified in 'Cash flows from financing activities' as repayments of lease liabilities under IFRS.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming the auditor's opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Valuation of goodwill in the Carbon Fiber Composite Materials segment\n\n## Description of Key Audit Matter\n\nAs described in 'Note 12. Goodwill and Intangible Assets' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded goodwill of 85,565 million yen (3.0% of total assets) as of March 31, 2021. Of this amount, in the Carbon Fiber Composite Materials segment, 60,309 million yen (70.5% of total goodwill) was recorded for Toray TCAC Holding B.V. and 11,580 million yen (13.5% of total goodwill) was recorded for Zoltek Companies, Inc.\n\nThe  Company  tests  cash-generating  units  or groups  of  cash-generating  units  to  which  goodwill  has  been  allocated  for  impairment  annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment, and  measures  the  recoverable  amount  of  each cash-generating unit at its value in use.\n\nThe value in use was determined by combining the discounted present value of the future cash flows based on the business plan for the next five years approved by management with a terminal value, reflecting past experience and external information. The business plan is primarily affected by\n\n## Auditor's Response\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures in considering the valuation of goodwill in the Carbon Fiber Composite Materials segment, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  We verified the valuation method used in calculating  value  in  use  by  involving  valuation specialists of our network firms.\n- \u00b7  For sales volumes and sales prices set forth in business plans, we held discussions with management and analyzed the figures by comparing them with past actual results.\n- \u00b7  We  compared  the  Company's  demand  outlook for its products, which is a premise used in estimating sales volumes, with market forecasts and available external data.\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the effectiveness of the estimation process that management uses for the business plan by comparing business plans from prior fiscal years with the corresponding actual results.\n- \u00b7  We verified the consistency between future cash flows and the business plan approved",

Impairment Losses' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded impairment loss of 24,968 million yen on production facilities in the Carbon Fiber  Composite  Materials  segment  located  in Washington, U.S.A. and other areas for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 due to a decline in profitability caused by sluggish demand for aircraft. The carrying amount after recording impairment loss is 53,192 million yen, which is included in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThe Company estimates the recoverable amounts of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible assets when there is any indication that they may be impaired and records impairment loss when the estimated recoverable amounts of these assets are less than its carrying amounts. In considering the amount to record for impairment loss on production facilities in the Carbon Fiber Composite Materials segment located in Washington, U.S.A. and other areas, the Company measures the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units at their value in use.\n\nThe value in use was calculated by discounting the future cash flows at a discount rate of 7.8%. The future cash flows were estimated based on the business plan for the next five years approved\n\n## Auditor's Response\n\nWe involved component auditors and performed the following audit procedures in considering impairment loss on production facilities in the Carbon Fiber  Composite  Materials  segment  located  in Washington, U.S.A. and other areas, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  We verified the valuation method used in calculating  value  in  use  by  involving  valuation specialists of our network firms.\n- \u00b7  For sales volumes and sales prices set forth in the business plan, we held discussions with management and analyzed the figures by comparing them with past actual results.\n- \u00b7  We compared the Company's demand outlook for its products, which is a premise used in estimating sales volumes, with available external data.\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the effectiveness of the estimation process that management uses for the business plan by comparing business plans from prior fiscal years with the corresponding actual results.\n- \u00b7  We  verified  the  consistency  between future cash flows and the business plan approved by management.\n- \u00b7  We compared growth rate and discount rate with estimates that were prepared by valuation",

The Group is communicating proactively with various stakeholders in all aspects of its corporate activities, and periodically report on and discuss the content of these activities with its management. With the goal of strengthening the system for engaging with stakeholders, a new organization was established to supervise communications in general in April 2018, and efforts are being made on centralizing the function of information transmission, both internally and externally.\n\n## Engaging with Stockholders and Investors\n\nThe Group actively communicates with institutional investors and securities company analysts by providing information materials when requested and holding same-day results briefings when quarterly earnings are announced. In addition to IR materials, including integrated annual reports, the Group also provides a wide range of information on management policies and strategies, as well as financial and earnings information in the Investor Relations section of the Toray website.\n\nBriefings on business for stockholders are held in order to deepen their understanding of Toray Group.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Toray held four results briefings and held 468 meetings with investors and analysts.\n\n## Engaging with Customers\n\nToray Group believes that the customer comes first. Communication is carried out closely with the customers, mainly through the marketing and sales departments, and periodic customer satisfaction surveys. The results of these surveys are shared internally at Board meetings and through in-house newsletters as the Group strives to provide even higher quality customer service.\n\nShowrooms were established at a number of locations, including the head office in Tokyo, the Toray Shiga Plant, and the Toray Human Resources Development Center in Mishima,  Shizuoka  Prefecture,  showing  our  businesses and product applications in an easy-to-understand manner to the public so as to deepen their understanding of Toray Group's stance toward contributing to solving various problems by creating and providing innovative technologies and cutting-edge materials.\n\n## Engaging with Business Partners\n\nWhile  providing  materials  and  products  as  a  manufacturer of advanced materials, Toray Group must engage in upstream management of its supply chains to better fulfill the needs of its customers, including the areas of production facilities and procured raw materials and resources. Accordingly, the Group has established its Basic Purchasing Policies and Basic Distribution Policies to emphasize this approach and ensure fair business activities. Throughout the Group, proper and fair transactions, adherence to laws, environmental  preservation,  respect  for  human  rights, improvements in quality and other policies in initiatives with regard to corporate responsibility in procurement, purchasing, and distribution are promoted.\n\n## Engaging with Employees\n\nAs one of the group-wide efforts in the Medium-Term Management Program, Project AP-G 2022, the Group promotes the Toray Philosophy Project (TP Project). In working to instill understanding of the Toray Philosophy among Toray Group employees, Toray Philosophy Book and the mini booklet version were published, and a range of activities were developed, such as the holding of in-house lectures by management and roundtable discussions at each workplace.\n\nUsing in-house newsletters, the group intranet, and company-wide bulletin boards, Toray Group actively promotes communication with its employees to not only disseminate information on company policies and issues, but to improve cohesion of the Toray brand and heighten each employee's sense of belonging.\n\n## Engaging with the Mass Media\n\nToray recognizes that public relations and corporate communication activities have a role in fulfilling responsibilities for information disclosure as well as influencing public opinion.  Accordingly,  Toray's  Corporate  Communications Department actively engages with a wide range of media organizations, acting as the public's point of contact with the Company.\n\nBased on Toray's Information Disclosure Principles, the department provides fair and impartial information, even if it may cast the Company in a bad light, in a timely and appropriate manner. In fiscal 2020, the Company issued 152 press releases and responded to 236 media requests for information.\n\n## Engaging with Local Communities\n\nIn addition to holding informal gatherings for discussion regularly, Toray Group strives to engage in more active dialogue with nearby residents in a variety of other settings, including by participating in events sponsored by local governments and inviting local residents onto plant grounds for summer festivals.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the various events that would previously have been held were largely canceled due to the impact of  COVID-19  infections.  However,  the  Group  actively engaged in activities to assist local communities in combating COVID-19 infections, by donating items such as masks and protective clothing.",
