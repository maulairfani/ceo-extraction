Ambani Chairman and Managing Director\n\n## Dear and Esteemed Fellow Shareowners,\n\nI have always started this letter by sharing with you the operational and financial achievements of Reliance during the year. But the past year has been a particularly challenging one for India and its people. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted several lives and dealt a severe blow to the economic health of the nation. It has also put tremendous burden on the healthcare infrastructure of the nation which is crucial for saving lives and reducing the impact of the pandemic. In these challenging times, the most remarkable and satisfying achievement of the company has been its humanitarian efforts in strengthening the nation's fight against the pandemic.\n\nRight from day one, Reliance has adopted a multi-pronged prevention, mitigation, adaptation and ongoing support strategy to fight the pandemic. Last year, as soon as the first few cases of COVID-19 were reported in India, Reliance Foundation (RF) set up India's\n\nfirst dedicated COVID-19 hospital in Mumbai in just two weeks. This year, in response to the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases in the city, RF rapidly scaled up its COVID operations to create 875-bed facilities dedicated to COVID care. It is the largest contribution by a philanthropic organisation to COVID care in Mumbai. RF has also set up fully equipped 1,000-bed COVID care facilities in Jamnagar. Overall, Reliance is supporting the set-up and management of over 2,300 beds across various locations.\n\nLast year, Reliance established a manufacturing unit in Silvassa to mass produce high quality PPE kits for the frontline warriors. It became the largest producer of high-quality PPEs in India. This year, in response to the urgent need for medical oxygen across the nation, Reliance repurposed its plants in Jamnagar to produce medical-grade oxygen, soon becoming the largest producer of medical-grade oxygen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfrom a single location in India. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Reliance has supplied over 55,000 MT of medical grade liquid oxygen across the country. It has also taken several steps to boost India's capacity to swiftly and safely transport this life-saving resource.\n\nThe Foundation also launched Mission Anna Seva, a programme to provide free meals to marginalised communities and frontline warriors across the nation. So far, RF has provided over 5.5 crore nutritious meals through ration kits, food coupons and cooked meals across 18 states and one Union Territory. This is the single largest meal distribution programme undertaken in the world by a corporate foundation.\n\nIn order to safeguard the health and well-being of our employees and their family members, we have set up several initiatives such as a nationwide emergency response infrastructure that is available 24x7. We have also created\n\nSUPPLIED MEDICAL GRADE LIQUID OXYGEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\n## 55,000 MT\n\nthe JioHealthHub app for free virtual video consultations with our doctors. Using the COVID-19 symptom checker, we are tracking the health of our employees and their family members. REFERS, our emergency response service, is constantly monitoring the symptom tracker and reaching out to those showing the risk of being COVIDpositive. In addition to this, our teams of medical experts are helping employees preserve mental health and emotional well-being through yoga and wellness sessions and psychological guidance.\n\nA key initiative to safeguard employees from the pandemic is R-Surakshaa, Reliance's own vaccination programme. Under R-Surakshaa, Reliance has initiated a tech-enabled, multi-location vaccination drive to vaccinate all employees, partners, associates, affiliates and their eligible family members for free. The vaccination drive is fully compliant with government rules and regulations.\n\nAlso, Reliance has put in place a liberal leave policy for employees affected by COVID-19. It is providing financial assistance of up to 3 months' pay as interest-free salary advance in case of an exigency. In case of unfortunate demise of an employee, Reliance is providing financial support to the family and committing to shoulder the educational expenses of the children.\n\nWhile the war against COVID is far from over, we, the Reliance Family are confident that in the end we will prevail. We care for each one of our stakeholders including employees, shareholders, vendors, customers and local communities.\n\nI will now update you on your company's operating and financial performance.\n\nDespite unprecedented challenges, we continued to execute on our growth plans across businesses. In our Retail business, we expanded\n\n~50\n\n## EBITDA CONTRIBUTION FROM CONSUMER BUSINESSES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour customer outreach by growing physical and digital footprint with store additions, strengthening of supply chain infrastructure and launch of JioMart. In Digital Services business, we increased network capacity and spectrum footprint while rapidly growing our customer base.\n\nOur consumer businesses, Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail, have proved to be digital and physical lifelines of the nation in these challenging times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur O2C business demonstrated resilience to rapidly evolving business environment. Agile business model, superior product placement capabilities and high utilisation rates while ensuring safe and reliable operations helped achieve industry leading performance.\n\n## Financial Performance and Balance Sheet\n\nIn a volatile environment, Reliance generated an EBITDA of ' 97,580 crore (US$13.3 billion), which is 4.6% lower than last year. Diversified earnings stream and resilient consumer businesses helped the company navigate through the unprecedented pandemic headwinds. Reliance recorded a consolidated net profit of ' 53,739 crore (US$7.4 billion) during the year, registering a growth of 34.8% y-o-y.\n\nOur consumer businesses retained their leadership positions and recorded robust growth on all operating and financial parameters during the year in spite of challenging hurdles. They now constitute nearly 50% of consolidated segment EBITDA compared to 36% in FY 2019-20.\n\nLARGEST EVER CAPITAL RAISE IN INDIA\n\n## ' 2,60,074 crore\n\nWe executed the largest ever capital raise in India, of J 2,60,074 crore (US$36 billion), through rights issue and asset monetisation. The fund raised, along with capital commitments, exceeded net debt levels, helping your company achieve a Net Debt Free balance sheet ahead of the stated timeline of March 2021.\n\nWe successfully completed India's largest ever Rights Issue of ' 53,124 crore (oversubscribed by 1.59 times), which is also the largest in the world by a Non-Financial Institution in the last 10 years.\n\nDuring the year, Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail raised ' 1,52,056 crore and ' 47,265 crore respectively from strategic and financial investors, including Facebook and Google. bp invested ' 7,629 crore for a 49% stake in our fuel retailing business.\n\nStrong operating cash flow and largest ever capital raise further strengthened our balance sheet, enabling us to deleverage and meet our net-debt zero commitment ahead of stated timeline.\n\nDuring the year, RIL made pre-payment of US$7.8 billion of long-term foreign currency debt, with requisite approvals from the RBI. This is the highest ever pre-payment of debt undertaken by any corporate borrower in India.\n\nWe now have a strong balance-sheet with high liquidity that will support growth plans for our three hyper-growth engines - Jio, Retail and O2C.",

It also enabled delivery of food and wellness at home, medical consultation at home and above all kept families connected through the pandemic. Higher acceptance of digital services reflects in 27% y-o-y growth in Jio's total data traffic to 1,668 crore GB in 4Q FY 2021.\n\nJio Platforms is building a massive digital ecosystem for a billion Indians by providing world-class connectivity and digital solutions across business verticals and customer lifecycle. Jio launched and scaled-up multiple digital platforms like JioMart, JioMeet, JioHaptik and JioUPI during the year. Jio's impact on internet usage in India has been recognised by Brand Finance, who recognised Jio as the 5 th strongest brand globally, terming its impact on the market as the 'Jio Effect'.\n\n## We are also excited with the\n\ndevelopment of a new generation cloud native 5G RAN technology that is truly open, and software defined. Qualcomm and Jio successfully tested 5G solutions in India, achieving the 1 Gbps milestone on Jio 5G solution.\n\nJio's innovation has spearheaded the transformation of India into one of the world's largest consumers of mobile broadband service.\n\n## Oil to Chemicals\n\nMarket environment during the first half of the year witnessed a highly volatile crude and feedstock price environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDemand destruction in the first half resulted in sharpest global oil demand contraction in decades, with a decline of 9.5 mb/d to ~90.5 mb/d in CY 2020. Travel restrictions significantly impacted the global demand for transportation fuels. For downstream products, demand destruction in automotive, housing & construction, consumer durables were partially offset by heightened demand from health & hygiene, packaging and e-commerce.\n\nBusiness environment for O2C segment improved sharply in the second half of the year with gradual easing of lockdowns and revival in economic activities, resulting in demand recovery to near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. Margin environment also improved in the second half of the year with rising demand and supply disruptions.\n\nAgile business operations through the COVID-19 crisis enabled Reliance to operate its O2C facilities at near 100% by shifting products to export markets. High operating levels helped Reliance meet commitments to suppliers, vendors and consumers, ensuring continuity of operations for the entire ecosystem.\n\nRecently, we initiated process of reorganising our O2C business into a separate subsidiary. The reorganisation will facilitate value creation through strategic partnerships and attract dedicated pool of investor capital. O2C's goal is to maximise crude to chemicals conversion and create a sustainable growth business. The scheme received an overwhelming support from our shareholders and creditors.\n\n## Oil and Gas E&P\n\nDespite extraordinary constraints during the period, Reliance successfully commissioned R Cluster field in KG D6 Block.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLocated at a water depth of greater than 2,000 meters, R Cluster is Asia's deepest and India's first ultradeepwater gas field.\n\nThis was followed by commissioning of Satellite Fields in April 2021, which was done ahead of schedule. It showcases your company's commitment towards India's transition into a cleaner and greener gas-based economy.\n\nThese complex deepwater projects have been executed in over 34 countries and at peak more than 4,000 people have been working offshore and onshore. Additionally, the pandemic constrained movement of people and material across the globe. Despite these odds, the projects had flawless and safe commissioning.\n\nR Cluster and Satellite Fields are two of the three new developments in the KG D6 block, the other being MJ fields which together are expected to meet ~15% of India's gas demand by 2023 and account for ~25% of domestic production. Peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be ~1 bcf/ day by 2023. It will help reduce India's dependence on imported gas.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nOur philosophy of inclusive growth is depicted in the way we conduct our businesses. Growth and development are often defined conventionally in terms of net profit, revenue, and other financial performance. While we realise that all these are important, our mission remains to continue growing as a responsible organisation that believes in enriching lives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue undertaking social initiatives in the areas of Education, Healthcare, Community Infrastructure, Skill Enhancement and Social Security.\n\nThe growing demand for energy is causing an imbalance in limited resources, especially in developing and emerging countries like India. We are committed to develop and grow in a responsible manner while meeting the expectations of all our stakeholders. We believe that business priorities co-exist with social commitments and our activities support inclusive growth. While we work towards achieving our goals, we see the need to meet the society's evolving expectations. And therein lies the need to form enriching partnerships that will help us create a sustainable future.\n\nThe world is now closing ranks for a strong global action on Climate Change. This gives Reliance the right opportunity to accelerate our own ambitious New Energy and New Materials business wedded to the vision of clean and green development. To combat climate change, Reliance has set itself a target to become Net Carbon Zero by 2035. This is part of a wider ambition to achieve best-in-class standards across environmental, social and governance\n\nparameters under the oversight of our Board. Our vibrant Board consists of independent thought leaders with requisite skill sets and domain expertise to guide our businesses on their future growth path.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we passionately strive for a better future, we continue to set new paradigms every single day. In an unpredictable and challenging environment, agility and innovation are key to staying consistently successful. As technology becomes a driving force in all businesses and facets of life, the future belongs to organisations that can lead and leverage the digital revolution.\n\nI would like to place on record my sincere appreciation to the Board of Directors for their guidance. I would also like to express my gratitude to all our stakeholders for their unwavering faith in Reliance. And I would like to thank the entire team at Reliance for their untiring efforts and unflinching commitment to achieve the lofty goals we have set ourselves for our Golden Decade.\n\nI also want to express my deepest gratitude to scientists, doctors, nurses, police, volunteers and many others who are waging the battle against COVID-19. We all owe a great deal to them. I am confident that we are going to ultimately win the fight against COVID-19. Because each one of us is engaged in this fight and the human spirit to fight and survive is greater than any disease or pandemic. With our collective effort, India will eventually triumph over the crisis and emerge stronger, bigger and better than ever.\n\nWith best wishes, Sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMukesh D.

        "page_content": "## Management Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Economic Context and Operational Highlights\n\n## Overview\n\n## Global\n\nThe global economy contracted by 3.3% in CY 2020, as all major economies barring China slipped into recession with COVID-induced lockdowns. Advanced Economies' (AE) decline of 4.7% was steeper than Emerging Markets (EM) decline of 2.2%. Within the AE complex, the decline in Euro Area (-6.6%) was much sharper than that in the US (-3.5%). Within the EMs, China's GDP grew 2.3%. Despite the steep global decline in CY 2020, global GDP decline was lower than initially feared primarily due to unprecedented monetary policy support from global central banks and fiscal stimulus from governments. Global fiscal stimulus reached ~US$18.6 trillion by March 2021 (23% of GDP) while monetary stimulus by global central banks reached US$16.6 trillion (21% of GDP).\n\nGlobal trade volume (goods and services) contracted by 9.6% in CY 2020 after a modest 1% increase in CY 2019. Global trade also started recovering in 4Q FY 2021 as merchandise trade volume turned positive on y-o-y basis from November 2020. Global trade is forecast to grow 8% in CY 2021 with merchandise volumes recovering faster than services volumes.\n\nOil prices averaged US$43/bbl in 2020 vs US$64/bbl in 2019 as COVID-19 led to an unprecedented erosion in global oil demand. Global demand averaged ~90.5 mb/d in 2020 (down 9.5 mb/d y-o-y). Large production cuts by OPEC+ 9.7 mb/d in May-July and 7.7 mb/d thereafter helped with a price floor in the face of the unprecedented demand shock. Global crude oil prices have recovered in 2021 as economies begin reopening amidst vaccine\n\nroll out. The US fiscal stimulus has further improved global oil demand outlook. Global demand is expected to grow 5.9 mb/d y-o-y in 2021 to average ~96.4 mb/d.\n\nThe global economy is expected to see a rebound in 2021 with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expecting 6% growth, with US stimulus and vaccine optimism leading to further opening up of the economies. The growth recovery is likely to be led by the US and China - the US is estimated to grow 6.4% in 2021 and China by 8.4%. Governments and Central Banks are expected to maintain supportive policies until the recovery is firmly underway. The strength of recovery will depend on vaccine roll-out.\n\n## India\n\nThe Indian economy is estimated to decline by 8% in FY 2020-21, the first year of contraction since 1980. India's economic decline was sharper than other key economies due to strict and early lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19. However, growth has continued to recover and was back in positive territory (+0.4%) in 3Q FY 2021 after a decline of 24.4% and 7.3% respectively in 1Q FY 2021 and 2Q FY 2021. India saw a V-shaped recovery as most consumption and industrial indicators were back in positive growth territory in the September-December quarter after being in deep negative in the June quarter. Auto sales rebounded from August 2020 onwards and both two-wheeler and passenger vehicle sales growth has been positive since then. Travel indicators have remained weak - air traffic still at -37% y-o-y in\n\nMarch 2021 and rail traffic also weak at -28% y-o-y. Among other industrial indicators, electricity demand growth is now positive and GST collections have remained robust at above ' 1 trillion mark. Digital adoption saw acceleration during the crisis, particularly in the usage of digital payments. UPI payments grew more than 100% y-o-y in 2021 as monthly transaction volumes crossed ' 4 trillion or nearly 25% of GDP on that run rate.\n\nThe external sector exhibited resilience as current account turned surplus for the first time since 2004, on weaker domestic demand, falling oil prices and strength in India's services exports. FDI and equity FII flows were strong, driving India's forex reserves to an alltime high of ~US$580 billion by the end of FY 2020-21, against ~US$475 billion by the end of FY 2019-20.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and the central and state governments provided critical support to the economy during the crisis. The RBI maintained loose monetary policy, cutting repo rates by 115 bps during early CY 2020. To keep funding markets easy, the RBI maintained liquidity surplus through various monetary measures.\n\nIndia's oil demand was down 9.1% y-o-y due to the unprecedented demand shock during 1H FY 2021.

By the end of the year, the digital commerce and merchant partnerships business accounted for about 10% of revenues, significantly stepped up from near zero in the preceding year. Reliance Retail invested behind a range of acquisitions to strengthen its capabilities in the supply chain, technology, and product portfolio.\n\nThese include the acquisition of leading digital marketplace, Netmeds, furniture and home decor retailer, Urban Ladder and the lingerie and intimate wear brand, Zivame. Reliance Retail also entered into an agreement to acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business of the Future Group for a consideration of ' 24,713 crore. This acquisition is awaiting requisite approvals.\n\n## Digital Services\n\nIn Digital Services, Reliance Jio became the first operator outside China to achieve 400 million subscribers in a single country market. Reliance Jio continues to revolutionise digitalisation in India with data consumption in excess of 5 Exabyte per month on its network.\n\nStrategic initiatives along with Facebook and Google will enhance consumer service offerings and facilitate greater digital inclusion in India. Reliance is working with Microsoft to enhance adoption of leading technologies like data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), cognitive services, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing among small and medium enterprises.\n\nQualcomm Technologies, Inc. and Jio, along with its wholly owned subsidiary Radisys Corporation, announced expanded efforts to develop open and interoperable interface compliant architecture-based 5G solutions with a virtualised RAN. This work is intended to fast-track the development and roll-out of indigenous 5G network infrastructure and services in India.\n\n1,732 MHz Reliance Jio total spectrum footprint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance Jio successfully acquired the right to use spectrum in all 22 circles across India in the recently concluded spectrum auctions conducted by the Government of India. Through this acquisition, Reliance Jio's total spectrum footprint has increased significantly, by 56%, to 1,732 MHz. The acquired spectrum can be utilised for transition to 5G services at the appropriate time, where Jio has developed its own 5G stack.\n\n## Oil to Chemicals\n\nReliance has initiated the proceedings of carving out its O2C businesses into a separate subsidiary and the process is expected to be completed in CY 2021. O2C reorganisation creates an independent, global-scale growth engine for RIL, with a strong cash flow generation potential while facilitating value creation through strategic partnerships and attracting a dedicated pool of investor capital.\n\nThrough the COVID-19 crisis, Reliance operated its O2C facilities at near 100% by shifting products to export markets to sustain operating rates. Scale economics along with strong competitive cost positions across the chain helped Reliance sustain positive contribution through this unprecedented phase. Diversified customer base, global product placement and feedstock flexibility supported performance.\n\n~100% Utilisation of O2C assets even during the COVID-19\n\nNOTICE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Oil and Gas E&P\n\nDuring the year, Reliance successfully commissioned Asia's deepest gas field and India's first ultra-deepwater gas field - R Cluster in KG D6 Block. This will help Reliance work towards India's transition to a cleaner and greener gas-based economy.\n\nThe year was also marked by the COVID-19 crisis, which resulted in a huge loss to mankind. During these tough times, Reliance leveraged all its resources - human as well as material - to assist India in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nApart from ensuring the safety and well-being of employees through the pandemic, Reliance significantly stepped up its support to the community. The COVID-19 response included use of facilities for production of grades and equipment used in medical applications, steps to support state medical infrastructure and contributions to social efforts in helping marginalised communities and migrant workers. Reliance is geared to provide products and services needed by Indian consumers as the economy emerges from the lockdown.\n\nTo combat climate change, Reliance has set itself a target to become Net Carbon Zero by 2035. This is based on RIL's vision of clean and green development which will provide the Company with an opportunity to accelerate and develop a New Energy and New Materials business.\n\nGOVERNANCE",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Industry Overview\n\n## Increasing 4G Penetration\n\nThe proliferation of 4G networks in India since Jio's launch across urban and rural India has resulted in over 700 million subscribers for network operators, including Jio. Deeper rollout of 4G-LTE networks has meant increased mobile internet penetration in rural areas to 35% versus 13% at the time of Jio's launch. Increasing network coverage, affordable tariffs, improving device ecosystem and affordability, and new use cases should continue the transition of over 300 million 2G feature phone users to 4G over the next 12-18 months.\n\n## Towards 2G Mukt Bharat (2G Free India)\n\nSince its launch in 2017, JioPhone has upgraded over 100 million users to the digital network, but without a device ecosystem and affordable 4G devices, millions of 2G subscribers are still unable to access the basic features of internet and digital applications. JioPhone (marketed by Reliance Retail) has been instrumental in bridging this digital divide by providing affordable technology in the hands of every Indian. Further, Jio and Google have agreed to jointly develop an entry-level affordable smartphone that will help unlock the true potential of the Digital India movement.\n\n## Exponential Growth of Data Usage\n\nImproving broadband network penetration, device and services affordability, and new use cases for digital have caused a 33% increase in data usage across the country over CY/uni00A02020 (99 exabytes of data usage in India during 2020). Mobile data usage in India is expected to quadruple to over 35 exabytes per month by 2026 with 1.2 billion smartphone users (Ericsson Mobility Report 2020) Jio, with its affordable data plans, has been the primary driver of data boom in India over the past three years.\n\n## IUC Regime for Domestic Voice Call Ends\n\nFollowing the industry's transition from Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC) to Bill and Keep (BAK) regime on January 1, 2021, Jio honoured its commitment to make off-net domestic voice-calls free as soon as IUC charges were abolished. On-net domestic voice calls have always been free on the Jio network. The transition to BAK regime is expected to hasten the adoption of more efficient technologies like VoLTE, which have a negligible cost for carrying and servicing essential voice services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enhancement of Spectrum Footprint\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the right to use spectrum in all 22 circles across India in the March 2021 auction held by the Department of Telecommunications of India, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) has completely de-risked its spectrum portfolio. Subsequently, Jio has also signed a definitive agreement with Bharti Airtel Limited, for trading of right-to-use spectrum in the 800/uni00A0MHz band in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Mumbai circles. Post the spectrum auction and the trading agreement with Bharti Airtel Limited, Jio has expanded its spectrum footprint by 56% to 1,732 MHz. It now has the highest amount of sub-GHz spectrum with 2X10 MHz contiguous spectrum in 18 out of the 22/uni00A0circles. It also has at least 2X10 MHz in 1,800 MHz band and 40 MHz in 2,300/uni00A0MHz band in each of the 22 circles.\n\nWith the enhanced contiguous spectrum footprint and pan-India infrastructure, RJIL has increased network capacity to serve both its existing and potential subscribers. The acquired spectrum, with an average life of 15.5 years, can also be utilised for transition to 5G services at an appropriate time in places where Jio has developed its own 5G stack.\n\n56% Increase in RJIL's spectrum footprint\n\nHighest Amount of sub-GHz spectrum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital Connectivity for Homes\n\nThe sub-optimal wireline infrastructure, which has suffered due to decades of low investments, has resulted in poor wireline penetration across homes (<10%) making India a laggard in fixed broadband services. Fiber penetration is even lower with most fixed broadband running on legacy copper-based infrastructure. Jio looks at Fiber to the Home (FTTH) services as a significant greenfield opportunity to connect 50 million homes across 1,600+ cities in India. Its extensive intracity fiber network, last mile execution, seamless customer experience along with an attractive bundling of digital content and smart home IoT solutions would be key differentiators.\n\nPoor infrastructure is also making it difficult for India's >150 million pay TV homes to transition to nonlinear content consumption.

This led to a sharp fall in advertising spend even as viewership soared during the lockdown, as weak economic activity and lack of fresh content during the first quarter kept advertisers at bay. The second half fared much better on the back of relaxation in lockdowns and higher advertiser appetite for the festive season.\n\n## 17. 5% Decline in ad spend in 2020E\n\nThe industry expects a much more normal 2021, with advertising recovering close to 2019 levels. Digital is likely to continue growing its share and TV is expected to revive fully, while print and other media are likely to remain under pressure.\n\n## Summarising FY 2020-21\n\nTV viewership soared up 35-40% during lockdown 1.0. News alone contributed to half the increase, reflected in the recovery of News advertising by the end of 1Q FY 2021. Other genres like Movies and Kids also saw an improvement, driven largely by a captive homebound audience. However, pay-GECs lost their viewership share as fresh content could not be produced and telecast during the initial phase. Entertainment advertising normalised by 3Q FY 2021, with GECs resuming fresh programming around the festive season. The top four broadcasters re-run and movie channels were re-launched on the Free Dish FTA platform in June 2020, driving viewership and monetisation. As the lockdown eased towards the second half of the year, TV viewership settled at slightly above pre-pandemic levels, and genre shares normalised too.\n\nDigital media platforms witnessed an increase in content consumption.

The EY FICCI M&E Report states that the pay-TV subscriber base was temporarily impacted by COVID-19 (primarily a ~3% dip in the cable segment), even as Free TV gained by return of top entertainment channels. Overall, time spent on TV rose by 7% y-o-y in 2020 as per BARC, as demographic and COVIDlinked tailwinds joined hands. TV pricing remained stable post New Tariff Order (NTO) 1.0, as NTO 2.0 remained sub-judice.\n\n## TV subscriptions in India\n\n| million   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Cable     |     73 |     75 |\n| DTH       |     56 |     56 |\n| HITS      |      2 |      2 |\n| Free TV   |     40 |     38 |\n| Total     |    171 |    171 |\n\nSource: EY-FICCI M&E Report\n\nDigital engagement continued to grow due to volume of high-quality content and key events.

        "page_content": "## Industry Overview\n\nFY 2020-21 was characterised by unprecedented volatility in crude oil and feedstock prices. It was a year of two halves - significant demand contraction in the first half due to pandemic-related lockdowns followed by a sharp recovery in economic activity and demand revival with fiscal stimulus in the second half.\n\n## Crude Oil Demand and Supply\n\nGlobal oil demand plunged by 16.2% y-o-y in 2Q CY 2020 to 82.9 mb/d. It recovered sharply to 92.6 mb/d in 3Q CY 2020. Overall demand in CY 2020 was at 91.0 mb/d, 8.7% below that in CY 2019. China was the only country to register growth.\n\nOPEC and several other oil exporting countries carried out coordinated supply cuts, which peaked at 9.7 mb/d during May-June 20 and averaged 5.3 mb/d for CY 2020. These cuts helped reduce crude inventories and rebalance supply and demand supporting oil prices.\n\n## Global Refining Operations\n\n## Global Refinery Crude Throughput (mb/d)\n\n|                   |   CY 2020 |      | CY 2019 Change 2020 vs. 2019   |\n|-------------------|-----------|------|--------------------------------|\n| OECD Americas     |      16.5 | 19.1 | (2.6)                          |\n| OECD Europe       |      10.7 | 12.2 | (1.5)                          |\n| China             |      13.4 | 13   | 0.4                            |\n| Rest of the World |      33.8 | 37.4 | (3.6)                          |\n| World Total       |      74.4 | 81.7 | (7.3)                          |\n\n## Source: IEA\n\nIn CY 2020, refining runs were lower by 7.3 mb/d from a year earlier, while demand declined by 8.7 mb/d. This resulted in weaker margins and permanent closure of refineries. Globally, announcements have already been made for the permanent closure of ~3.4 mb/d refining capacity by 2023.\n\n## Crude Oil and LNG Prices\n\nCrude prices plummeted during 1Q FY 2021 with Brent crude oil touching a low of US$18.5/bbl in April 2020. However, the sharp supply cuts, coupled with disruptions in February 2021 due to Texas freeze, pushed crude prices back to pre-pandemic levels in March 2021.\n\n## OIL PRICES\n\n(US$/bbl)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDated Brent\n\nWTI\n\nDubai\n\nSource: Platts\n\nLNG prices were highly volatile during the year, with prices in Asia starting at a low level of around US$2/mmbtu at the beginning of the year due to demand drop before peaking at US$32.50/ mmbtu in January 2021 due to supply disruptions in Nigeria, Panama Canal congestion and colder winter in Far East. Prices have since then cooled with the restoration of supplies.\n\nCost of shipping crude surged in March 2020 and continued to be high in April 2020 as weak demand for prompt supplies had seen an increasing number of tankers booked for floating storage. In clean freight markets, demand for floating storage caused shipping rates to soar in April 2020. From May 2020, freight rates normalised for both crude as well as products as global crude production fell sharply and reduced interest in floating storage with lower production.\n\n## Transportation Fuels\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nGlobal gasoline and gasoil demand in CY 2020 was lower by 3.0 mb/d and 1.8 mb/d respectively compared to CY 2019. Gasoline demand recovered quickly from the lows in 2Q CY 2020, as preference for use of personal vehicles for daily commute increased during the pandemic. Diesel demand was also adversely impacted, before recovering in-line with revival in economic activity. Jet fuel demand was the worst hit due to stringent restrictions on air travel, falling 40.6% from the previous year.\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nIndia's petroleum products demand contracted by 9.1% to 195 MMT in FY 2020-21; LPG demand maintained an upward growth trajectory. India's demand for gasoline and gasoil rebounded sharply in the second half, but overall demand in FY 202021 was still down by 6.7% and 12%, respectively. Gasoline sales returned to pre-pandemic levels in September 2020. The aviation industry was the worst hit. Domestic flights resumed in a calibrated\n\n## LNG PRICE ASSESSMENT\n\n(US$/mmbtu)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Japan Korea Marker West Coast India\n\nmanner from May 2020 and reached 70% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of FY 2020-21. Jet/Kero demand fell sharply by 47% y-o-y.\n\n## Margins\n\nDuring FY 2020-21, 10 ppm gasoil and Jet/Kero cracks in the Singapore market were down by 60% and 90% y-o-y respectively. Low jet fuel demand due to disruption in air travel and tourism industry made refiners shift yield towards the gasoil pool, capping gasoil cracks upside.\n\nGasoline 92R cracks were lower by 55.3% y-o-y, as lockdowns resulted in reduced mobility across the globe. High spare capacity and inventory levels weighed on gasoline cracks.\n\nHowever, in 1Q CY 2021, gasoline cracks touched pre-pandemic levels while gasoil and jet cracks continued to lag at 49% and 39%, respectively.\n\n## Asian Cracks for Transportation Fuels\n\n| (US$/bbl)   |     |   FY 2020-21 FY 2019-20 |\n|-------------|-----|-------------------------|\n| Gasoline    | 3   |                     6.7 |\n| Jet         | 1.2 |                    12.6 |\n| Gasoil      | 5.7 |                    14.1 |\n\nSource: Platts\n\n## Global Cracker Operations\n\nGlobal demand for ethylene registered a moderate 1.7% y-o-y growth to 166 MMT in CY 2020 from 163 MMT in CY 2019, while operating rates fell to 86% from 90%. New capacity addition of 11 MMTA during the year significantly outpaced demand growth. The liquidity crunch caused by the pandemic delayed start-ups as well as final investment decisions for new projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethane and Naphtha Prices\n\nAverage naphtha prices in Asia were down by 21% y-o-y in FY 2020-21 amidst softening of crude price in 1H FY 2021 and slowdown of demand due to low global economic activity. However, prices recovered in 2H FY 2021 with healthy demand from downstream chemicals/ products, improving demand of gasoline blending and higher crude prices.\n\n## Polymers and Elastomers\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nDemand destruction in certain sectors like automotive, housing and construction and white goods/consumer durables had a negative impact on the downstream business. At the same time, the pandemic resulted in surge in demand for polymers and polyesters from the health & hygiene, packaging and e-commerce sectors.\n\nGlobal polymer demand [for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC)] in CY 2020 was 230 MMT, up by 2% y-o-y. Global PP and PE demand grew by 3% in CY 2020, led by Asia, especially China and India. Demand for PVC remained subdued during the year as a sustained high price environment caused shift to alternative products. Global demand for Polybutadiene Rubber (PBR) and Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) elastomers contracted by 6% and 7% respectively during CY 2020, on the back of weak automotive sector demand.\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nPP demand in the country grew at a marginal 2% y-o-y on account of subdued demand from the auto sector and overall lower consumption owing to the pandemic in 1H FY 2021. However, demand from the health & hygiene sector, raffia and Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) packaging remained buoyant. PE demand registered a healthy growth of 7% y-o-y, driven by e-commerce, FMCG and liquid packaging. Policy boost for several water and sewage pipeline projects further pushed polymer demand. The all-time-high prices of PVC caused a slight demand shift to alternative materials for the pipes sector.",

Tyre majors registered a good performance in 2H FY 2021 amid strong farm and 2/3-wheeler tyre demand which drove up domestic demand for SBR to 7% y-o-y, while PBR demand remained flat.\n\n## Margin\n\nPolymer prices weakened at the beginning of 2020, but gradually improved by the second quarter on the back of healthy demand from the essential goods and services sector. Global operating rate for PP and PE averaged 86% and 85% respectively during 2020. Polymer margins strengthened especially in 2H FY 2021 with recovery in demand, reduced availability due to supply chain constraints and polar freeze in USGC. Integrated PP-Naphtha and HDPE-Naphtha margins expanded 22% and 31%, respectively. PVC margins were at multi-year high amidst supply shortages. Elastomer margins remained strong, especially towards the end of the year, due to lower feedstock prices and supply constraints. Margins trended above 5-year average and were up 64% and 77% y-o-y for PBR and SBR, respectively.\n\n## Southeast Asia Polymer Margins\n\n| (US$/MT)       |     | FY 2020-21  FY 2019-20   |\n|----------------|-----|--------------------------|\n| HDPE-Naphtha   | 512 | 390                      |\n| PP-Propylene   | 193 | 166                      |\n| PVC-EDC-       | 584 | 462                      |\n| Naphtha        |     |                          |\n| PBR-BD         | 727 | 444                      |\n| SBR-BD-Styrene | 718 | 405                      |\n\nSource: Platts and ICIS\n\n## Intermediates and Polyesters\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nGlobal demand for Intermediates (MEG/PX/PTA) fell by 6% to 143 MMT in CY 2020 from 152 MMT in 2019. PX markets improved in the latter part of the year due to new downstream PTA capacity additions. PTA markets remained healthy as downstream\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperating rates went up despite rising inventory in the first half of the year. MEG demand strengthened in the latter part of the year due to supply concerns from the US, and this was reflected in declining port inventories.\n\nOverall demand for polyesters was marginally lower by 6% to 77 MMT. The pandemic adversely affected the global demand for textiles and apparels, but demand for PET (face shield), LAB (detergent products) and non-woven staple fibre (PPE kits, face masks, and polyester swabs) witnessed a surge.\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nDomestic demand for intermediates was impacted due to demand destruction in the textile and polyester industry at the time of the pandemic. Demand for the year contracted by ~14%, reflecting pandemic's impact on downstream sectors.\n\nThe downstream polyester industry in the country bore the brunt of the nationwide lockdown and the closure of downstream units due to mass labour exodus. The industry revived with the gradual easing of the lockdown and festive season demand, reaching pre-pandemic levels by the end of FY 2020-21.\n\n## Margins\n\nWith reduced global gasoline blending demand, integrated chemical complexes continued to ramp up PX production. This resulted in a high PX inventory (up to 4 MMTA) in China, which was further impacted by capacity expansions of 1.8 MMTA. Global PX operating rates dropped to 71% in 2020 on the back of unprecedented capacity expansions in China. PX prices dropped\n\n28% while PX-Naphtha margins dipped 41% y-o-y, well below 5-year average levels.\n\nPTA markets in China remained oversupplied given the capacity addition of 9.9 MMTA and large market inventories. Global PTA operating rates dipped to 78% in 2020. Overall, in FY 2020-21, PTA prices dropped by 21% while PTA-PX margins firmed up by 1% y-o-y.\n\nGlobal MEG markets witnessed capacity addition of ~3.7 MMTA in an already over supplied market. Global MEG operating rates dropped to 66%. However, in the second half of FY 2020-21, MEG markets strengthened as supplies from the US were impacted by hurricanes and the Arctic freeze. High polyester operating rates also kept sentiments healthy. MEG prices dropped by 9% and MEG-Naphtha margins firmed up by 8% y-o-y.\n\nPET markets witnessed a slowdown as consumption of beverages witnessed a dip amid the global pandemic. However, demand in the health sector and packaging improved. PET prices dropped by 16% and margins dipped by 8% y-o-y.\n\n## Intermediates and Polyester Margin Trends\n\n| (US$/MT)       |     |   FY 2020-21  FY 2019-20 |\n|----------------|-----|--------------------------|\n| PX- Naphtha    | 172 |                      292 |\n| PTA-PX         | 157 |                      155 |\n| MEG-Naphtha    | 232 |                      215 |\n| POY-PTA & MEG  | 203 |                      282 |\n| PSF-PTA & MEG  | 150 |                      163 |\n| PET- PTA & MEG | 146 |                      158 |\n\nSource: Platts, ICIS, CCFGroup\n\n## Performance Update\n\n## Financial and Business Performance\n\n## Financial Performance\n\n| In  '  crore                    | FY 2020-21   | FY 2019-20   | % change y-o-y   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Revenue                         | 3,20,008     | 4,51,355     | (29.1)           |\n| EBITDA                          | 38,170       | 53,803       | (29.1)           |\n| EBITDA margin (%)               | 11.9         | 11.9         | -                |\n| Total throughput (MMT)          | 71.9         | 79.8         | (9.9)            |\n| Production meant for sale (MMT) | 63.6         | 71.0         | (10.4)           |\n\nThe O2C business experienced both price and margin dislocation due to the pandemic and lockdown in many countries in 1H FY 2021.

Most of the reduction came from transportation fuels due to global demand destruction. However, with an agile business model and the ability to optimise feedstock usage, Reliance was able to run downstream plants at full throughput.\n\n## Transportation Fuels\n\nThe strong network presence on the highways and industry-leading fleet programme (Transconnect) helped recover gasoline and gasoil volumes to pre-pandemic levels. Strong Quality and Quantity (Q&Q) assurance also contributed to the volume recovery.\n\nReflecting the Net Carbon Zero target of RIL, RBML aspires to provide Indian consumers with advanced fuels that have lower emissions, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and other low carbon solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo support the proposed network expansion of up to 5,500 outlets over five years, RBML kickstarted its franchise onboarding process. It has initiated infrastructure development at all supply locations and started pilot testing of battery swap stations at over 24 select locations. Initial response has been encouraging with strong growth in daily order deliveries.\n\nRBML is committed to create a world class fuelling experience for its customers, with proven customer value proposition, synergies of extended group companies (RIL and bp), company-wide focus on customer centricity and best-in-class technology.\n\nIn FY 2020-21, bulk diesel industry volumes shrunk by 22% on y-o-y basis. Despite facing a contraction of 17% y-o-y, RIL did better than the industry and increased its market share to 9.3%, focusing on the infrastructure, construction and mining segments.\n\nReliance BP Mobility Limited (RBML), a 51:49 joint venture of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and bp, went live on July 10, 2020. RBML operates under the 'Jio-bp' brand.\n\nRBML, with its network of 1,419 outlets and fleet programme (Transconnect), fully recovered its pre-pandemic gasoline and gasoil sales volumes.\n\nRBML has become India's largest fuel door delivery network for specified use, with presence at 1,083 sites in 21 states. RBML has launched light-weight and tamper-proof high density PE fuel containers for doorstep delivery which promises operational ease, efficiency, and quantity and quality (Q&Q) assurance.\n\nIn August 2020, RBML took over the operations of RIL aviation fuel stations across the country. It aspires to bring industry-leading technology, best-in-class service and innovative customer-centric solutions to aviation fuelling. RBML fuelled medical, repatriation and cargo flights across India at the peak of the lockdown.\n\n1,419 outlets In the RBML network\n\n5,500 outlets Proposed network post expansion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Polymers and Elastomers\n\nRIL maintained steady polymer production with reliable operations across sites and achieved the highest ever PE production in FY 2020-21. It maintained operating rates higher than its peers due to its keen focus on exports in the first half, and its ability to ride on a buoyant market in the second half. RIL maintained its market leadership in polymers, with a domestic market share of 34%. It exported 1.3 MMT of polymers across the world during the year.\n\nRIL's agile supply chain helped place 80% polymer products in the export market within 10 days during the challenging 1Q FY 2021, as against 20% during the pre-COVID period. This helped in operating plants at near full capacity of 98% during 1Q FY 2021 while the rest of the domestic industry operated at 60% levels.\n\n## Intermediates and Polyesters\n\nA total of 2.1 MMT was exported in FY 2020-21 across the entire polyester chain. RIL also maintained its market share in the domestic polyester market. Significant PX and Benzene exports in 1H FY 2021 helped maintain the operating rate of aromatics plants. PTA exports during 1H FY 2021 were impacted, curtailing PTA production. Demand destruction in MEG was countered by diverting the surplus volume into exports market.\n\nRIL continued to explore new products and market segments with the introduction of biodegradable polyester and R3S in the paint segment. At the same time, given the unique circumstances, RIL focused on developing essential products like PPE suits, polyester swabs and other medical applications to cater to the needs of critical segments like health and hygiene.",

The Company constantly endeavours to imbibe the concept of circularity in its operations and processes. Cognisant of the fact that achieving this objective requires long-term commitment and collaboration amongst various stakeholders, it supports like-minded organisations, NGOs and individuals in waste recycling and diverting post-consumer waste away from landfill while creating awareness about the environment among consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collaboration with Pankaj and Nidhi at LFW\n\nR|Elan\u2122 has been consistently supporting circularity in the fashion industry. During the year, the brand collaborated with the famous designer duo, Pankaj and Nidhi, for the second time to showcase its latest collection at the first-ever digital edition of LFW.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe new collection showcased R|Elan\u2122 GreenGold, made from 100% recycled PET bottles, R|Elan\u2122 FeelFresh, which has anti-microbial properties, and R|Elan\u2122 Kooltex, which keeps the wearer cool and comfortable for a longer time.\n\nRIL has identified short, medium and long term strategies to support a circular economy for plastics. In the short term, the focus is on increasing the Company's PET recycling footprint and usage of Multi-layered Plastics (MLP) for road construction. In the medium term, it is focusing on polyolefin recycling and 'waste to oil' strategy. In the long term, the Company is looking at chemical recycling, plastic waste composites and design for circularity. Various initiatives are on the go.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## R|ELAN\u2122 - Circular Design Challenge\n\nDuring FY 2020-21, R|Elan\u2122 initiated the third season of Circular Design Challenge (CDC) in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) in March 2021. In partnership with IMG and UNEP, R|Elan\u2122 unveiled the collection 'Malai', winner from the second edition of LFW. The collection uses a bio-composite material made from the agricultural waste of South India's coconut industry. With circularity at the core of all six designers' portfolio, CDC 3.0 showcased stunning collections made from materials like discarded tarpaulin, post-consumer clothing, handwoven and upcycled textiles, waste denim and recycled PET bottles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Launch of waste reduction programme\n\nR|Elan\u2122 collaborated with Forest Essentials\u2122, the Ayurvedabased skincare and perfume brand, in September 2020 to encourage recycling of used plastic packaging. As part of the collaboration, Forest Essentials\u2122 created a collection facility in each of its major stores across the country. Customers are being encouraged to drop empty jars and bottles into these facilities through a reward programme. The waste collection is to be processed and repurposed to make GreenGold\u2122 fibres and fabrics for apparel, bags and other applications.\n\n## Anti-microbial mask from R|Elan\u2122\n\n## #FeelSafeFeelFresh Campaign\n\nR|Elan\u2122 tied up with India's leading brand, Proline\u00ae to create a range of attractive, high performance masks using R|Elan\u2122 FeelFresh\u2122 fabric with anti-microbial attributes. The Proline\u00ae Reusable Protection Mask has a three-layer triple particle filtration system and offers the superior fabric qualities of R|Elan\u2122 FeelFresh\u2122, which is embedded with silver technology to provide long lasting protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alliance to end plastic waste\n\nRIL is the founding member and the lone Indian company to participate in the global effort to eliminate plastic waste in the environment through the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). The Company aims to bring the best technologies and companies to India for elimination of plastic waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Support for Indian Centre for Plastics in the Environment (ICPE)\n\nRIL continues to support ICPE communication initiatives by supporting the 'Fight Pollution, Not Plastics' (FPNP) awareness campaign, school engagement campaigns and an all-India creative competition to find ways to reduce plastics pollution.\n\n## Reverse vending machine\n\nRIL has sponsored more than 100 reverse vending machine installations across major cities to enhance awareness amongst the public about plastic waste.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Scaling up Digital Platforms to Enrich Customer Experience\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden change in the way of working, supported and sustained by digital collaboration platforms. The following digital initiatives were implemented in a short span of time to support the shift in business condition and ensure seamless migration to a virtual working environment.\n\n## Digital customer experience\n\n- \u00b7 Collaborative planning through CRM platform to effectively manage customer demand\n- \u00b7 Mobility apps for approvals, account management and customer visits to empower the sales team for better customer service\n- \u00b7 Secured document sharing platform (E-Room) for effective (finance, shipping and forwarding documents) collaboration with internal as well as external bodies primarily with a work-from-home focus\n\n## Digitalisation in supply chain, planning and optimisation\n\n- \u00b7 Warehouse Management (EWM) operated mobility solutions on smart devices, which simplified complex logistics, optimised inventory tracking, distribution operations and multi-channel fulfilment\n- \u00b7 Improved profitability through digitalisation of the integrated value chain planning and optimisation for all downstream products, including Recron Malaysia and integration with upstream at Cracker\n\n## Digitisation and Analytics for process optimisation\n\n- \u00b7 SCM Spend Analytics to include components like shipping, multimodal and chartering (bulkers)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Export General Manifest (EGM) downloads from ICEGATE (e-commerce portal for central excise and customs) are now automated through deployment of bots\n- \u00b7 Export documentation processes like LC Scrutiny, SI (Shipping Instruction) BL (Bill of Lading) scrutiny and SI filing with shipping line portal are digitised and automated with the help of AI/ML\n- \u00b7 Trip check application was rolled out on tab devices at downstream secondary warehouses. Major components of this application are Truck Health Check, Trip Check (PreLoad) and Trick Check (Post-Load)\n\n## CASE STUDIES\n\n## Ecosystem for indigenous PPE production\n\nRIL scaled up production of PP fibre and filament grades that are used as raw material for N95 masks and PPE suits. It developed very high-flow melt blown grades (1800-2300 MFI) in collaboration with a domestic compounder and masterbatch manufacturer to produce indigenous PPE kits with higher Particulate Filtration Efficiency (PFE). As a result, India became the world's 2 nd largest PPE kit manufacturer and net exporter, even though it did not have capacity to produce PPE kits till January 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 l a/k001 h /day Production of PPE kits\n\nand N95 masks\n\n## Redefining fuel retailing through e-commerce in India\n\nRBML is the first Oil Marketing Company (OMC) to get the approval of Mobile Dispensing Unit and the only OMC to use HDPE containers (non-metallic) for on demand delivery of fuel. With its services spanning across India, it is uncovering the latent needs of the non-transport sector, and meeting these needs with great efficiency, leading the way to market leadership in the non-transport sector.\n\n## Transconnect: Building strong relationships\n\nRBML's large network, channel participation and field force focus with customised IT tool helps it drive volume. The Transconnect programme helps it ease the transaction process through secure card-less solution (Trans-mobile). Through Transconnect, RBML leveraged contactless operational capability during the lockdown, leading to significantly higher fleet volume share and highest ever monthly sales in FY 2020-21.\n\nCORPORATE CORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW OVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL FINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS STATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW REVIEW\n\n## Outlook\n\nGlobal vaccination drive and large stimulus programmes will influence consumer sentiments and demand growth, in the medium term. Oil demand is expected to recover in CY 2021 to 96.4 mb/d, still below CY 2019 levels of 99.7 mb/d as per IEA. However, tightness in the crude oil market and strong prices are likely to continue due to OPEC+ cooperation.\n\nGlobal transportation fuels demand (except Jet fuel) is likely to reach pre-COVID levels only by the end of FY 2021-22. Container shortages are expected to continue through 1H FY 2022, supporting margins for polymers and intermediates.\n\nStrong domestic demand across key segments such as healthcare, packaging, durables, auto and infrastructure is expected to drive demand for downstream products. Near term demand trends can be impacted by the ongoing second wave of the pandemic and fresh restrictions.\n\nGOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE\n\nNOTICE",

Market saw an oversupply of ~20 MMb/d in April 2020, pushing Brent prices to US$18.5/bbl before recovering to US$63.5/bbl by the year-end. There was an overall collapse of 8.8 MMb/d demand in 2020. Majority of E&P companies opted to defer project investment decisions amid capital preservation measures. Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude averaged at US$42.0/bbl and US$39.2/bbl respectively in CY 2020. This was US$15/bbl lower than the average CY 2019 price.\n\nThe demand is expected to recover, though resurgence in COVID-19 cases is slowing the rebound. Widespread vaccination effort and an acceleration in economic activity coupled with OPEC+ decision to delay further easing of cuts and Saudi Arabia's additional supply reduction of 1 MMb/d in February and March is expected to spur stronger growth in coming time.\n\nGlobal gas demand fell 2.5% to ~3,840 BCM while output fell 3.6% to 3,918 BCM. Natural gas prices in 2020 remained low due to dampened economic activities impacting both production and consumption. US Henry Hub gas price averaged at US$2.05/ MMBTU (compared to average of US$2.57/MMBTU in CY 2019), the lowest annual average price in decades.\n\n## Emerging Trends and Business Response\n\nDescription\n\n## Clean Energy\n\nGlobal focus is on green energy in order to address environmental concerns to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Brownfield Developments\n\nIn these challenging times, when demand and prices for oil and gas are falling, companies are focusing on brownfield developments to reduce cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow RIL E&P is geared up?\n\nThe Company is focusing on building a gas-based portfolio. Gas being a cleaner fuel, is considered world-over as a transition fuel to green energy\n\nThe Company is leveraging its existing infrastructure in the KG Basin to develop three projects in Block KG D6 and is undertaking exploration in contiguous areas\n\nThe Company has always been at the forefront in the adoption of latest technologies. It is further enhancing its capabilities through Digital Twin, Autonomous Fields, Virtual Command Centres and other cuttingedge technologies\n\n## Digital Technologies\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of adoption of new technologies for improved efficiencies",

        "page_content": "## Performance Update\n\nSegment revenues for FY 2020-21 were lower by 33.4% y-o-y to ' 2,140 crore primarily due to lower volumes from conventional fields and overall lower commodity price realisation. EBITDA for the year declined by 26.9% to ' 258 crore.\n\nFor the year, domestic production (RIL share) was at 27.8 BCFe, down 28.4% y-o-y due to expiry of Panna Mukta Production Sharing Contract in December 2019 and cessation of production from D1D3 (KG D6) field in February 2020 and in US Shale (RIL share), production was 98.8 BCFe, up 22.9% on a y-o-y basis.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\n| Parameter   | FY 2020-21  ( '  in crore)   | FY 2019-20  ( '  in crore)   | % change  y-o-y   |\n|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Revenue     | 2,140                        | 3,211                        | (33.4)            |\n| EBITDA      | 258                          | 353                          | (26.9)            |\n\n## Operational Performance\n\n## Domestic\n\n| JV production          | Unit of  Measurement   | FY 2020-21   | FY 2019-20   |\n|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| KG D6                  |                        |              |              |\n| Gas                    | BCF                    | 24.0         | 17.5         |\n| PANNA/hyphen.cap MUKTA |                        |              |              |\n| Oil                    | MMBBL                  | -            | 2.6          |\n| Gas                    | BCF                    | -            | 34.2         |\n| CBM                    |                        |              |              |\n| Gas                    | BCF                    | 11.8         | 12.2         |\n\n## Business Performance\n\n## KG D6\n\nTill date, the Block has produced 3/uni00A0TCFe of gas, oil and condensate while establishing several global benchmarks in terms of operational performance, including 99.9% uptime and 100% incident-free operations. Majority of existing production facilities are being utilised towards integrated development of the three ongoing projects.\n\n## R Cluster Field\n\nThe R Cluster field was commissioned successfully in December 2020, despite challenges imposed due to COVID-19 and adverse weather. Located at a water depth of greater than 2,000 meters, it is Asia's deepest and India's first ultradeepwater gas field.\n\nAll six wells have been opened and tested, with ramp-up programme currently ongoing. Current production is in line with expectation and is being ramped-up. The field is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.8 MMSCMD in 2021.\n\n## R Cluster and Satellite Cluster have been commissioned.\n\n## Satellite Cluster\n\nAll five development wells have been drilled and completed. Production from the field commenced in April 2021, two months ahead of schedule.\n\n## Development Status\n\n## MJ Field\n\nEngineering, procurement and manufacturing activities for FPSO, Subsea Production System, Risers and Umbilicals are currently underway. Drilling campaign commenced in March 2020 and is currently ongoing. First installation campaign commenced in 4Q FY 2021 with the second and final installation campaign planned in 4Q FY 2022.\n\n## Abandonment\n\nD1D3 field ceased production in February 2020. The D1D3 Field Decommissioning Plan for abandonment of wells and facilities has been submitted to OISD for approval.\n\n## Exploration Strategy\n\nRIL's exploration strategy is focused on catchment areas to leverage existing infrastructure. Block KG-UDWHP-2018/1 (KG-UDW1) was awarded to RIL-bp JV under OALP II licensing round and Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) was issued in August 2019. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of India granted 341 days extension of the initial exploration phase.\n\n3D Seismic Acquisition campaign is being undertaken in the Block.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Coal Bed Methane (CBM)\n\nRIL is currently producing CBM from the Block SP (West)-CBM-2001/1. More than 300 wells are on production with production averaging 1 MMSCMD during the year. To sustain plateau production further, development is being undertaken in the Blocks SP (West)-CBM-2001/1 and SP (East)CBM-2001/1 block.\n\nReliance Gas Pipelines Limited, a subsidiary of RIL, operates the 302 km Shahdol-Phulpur Pipeline from Shahdol (MP) to Phulpur (UP) connecting the CBM gas fields with the Indian gas grid.\n\n## US Shale\n\nThe sharp decline in commodity prices slowed down development activity in both JVs. Despite prices recovering during 2H CY 2020, given the weak macro environment and its impact on price realisation, both Marcellus and Eagleford JVs pursued minimal activity and optimised costs. Reliance and its JV partners continued efforts on preserving long-term value through strict capital discipline and curtailing development activity.\n\nIn 4Q FY 2021, Reliance sold its interest in Marcellus JV to EQT Aurora LLC and Northern OIL & Gas.\n\nDuring 2Q FY 2021 Newpek LLC, the minority partner in Ensign JV, exited and its participating interest was acquired by Reliance and Ensign proportionately.\n\nDue to the adverse changes in market environment, reduction in activity by operator and recent operational performance, the Shale Gas subsidiaries have impaired their assets, including unavoidable costs based on contractual commitments, totalling to ' 15,691 crore.\n\n## Operational Performance\n\n| JV             | Unit of  Measurement   |   CY  2021 |   CY  2020 |\n|----------------|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Production Gas | BCFe                   |       65.9 |       83.3 |\n| Condensate     | MMBBL                  |        2.4 |        2.6 |\n\nIn 2020, the JVs together drilled 28 wells and put 26 wells on production.\n\nGross JV production was ~0.64 BCFe/d for the two JVs, up 22% y-o-y. Reliance's share of production and sales were at 99.0 BCFe and 85.9 BCFe, respectively in CY 2020, compared to 80.4 BCFe and 70.5 BCFe in CY 2019.\n\nIn Marcellus JV, Chevron put one pad on production in operated areas which was drilled and frac'ed in 2019, before handing over the operatorship to EQT.\n\nIn Eagleford JV, Ensign continued with one rig programme until 1H CY 2020. Only three new wells were put on stream, while it drilled 11 wells.\n\nReliance's aggregate capital investments across JVs decreased significantly y-o-y and was US$66 million during CY 2020.\n\n## New Technologies\n\n## Bio-CBM\n\nTo increase recovery from CBM fields, Reliance is engaged in R&D efforts with current focus on Bio-CBM.\n\nIn CBM, methane gas, which is adsorbed and trapped naturally in coal seams, is produced. Bio-CBM technology uses microbe injection to produce in-situ methane where either the coals are devoid of methane or conventional CBM extraction is uneconomical.\n\nLab tests have shown encouraging results with respect to methane production potential. Research is underway to establish the ability of this technology to scale up to a commercial operation.",

RIL, with development of three deepwater gas projects in KG D6, will continue to play a key role. While two projects have been successfully commissioned, one project is expected to come onstream in FY 2022-23. With this, RIL is expecting to reach a peak production of ~ 30 MMSCMD in CY 2023, i.e., ~25% of India's production and ~15% of India's demand.\n\nRIL will continue its exploration efforts in the catchment areas, which, if successful, will be able to leverage its existing world-class deepwater hub infrastructure.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose constraints and challenges, RIL's focus remains on ensuring safety for its people and assets, timely delivery of ongoing projects and uninterrupted production operations.\n\nGOVERNANCE GOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE NOTICE",

Reliance has been able to successfully navigate this volatility.\n\nThe Company has successfully completed one of the largest equity capital raise programmes and has repaid debt liabilities including US$7.8 billion of ECB borrowings, the largest ever such prepayment programme undertaken by any corporate entity in India. The Company remains firmly committed to efficient financing of its working capital, across all formats of businesses, and maintains a strong liquidity position with more than ' 2.5 lakh crore of cash and cash equivalent in its consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Highlights\n\nDuring the year, Reliance successfully raised equity in (i) Jio Platforms Limited from global strategic investors, including Facebook and Google and marquee financial investors totaling US$21 billion for ~33% stake, (ii) Reliance Retail Ventures Limited from marquee financial investors totaling ~US$6 billion for ~10% stake; (iii) fuel retailing business by entering into a partnership with bp; (iv) Reliance Industries Ltd by way of Rights Issue. The equity capital thus raised allowed Reliance to significantly deleverage its balance sheet and deliver on its promise of attaining zero net debt status.\n\nFinancial markets were extremely choppy and volatile during the year. The first half of the year saw large-scale destruction of demand in the economy, significant fall in interest rates and weakening of the rupee and the second half of the year witnessed a bounce back in growth, recovery of crude oil price, strengthening of the rupee and an upward movement in interest rates. The Company was successfully able to navigate all such dislocations in the market, maintain adequate liquidity on its balance sheet, manage its financial market risks and deliver\n\na consistent return on its investment portfolio by staying invested in low risk, liquid instruments. Reliance Treasury continued to stay focused on providing liquidity to the businesses at the optimal risk adjusted cost by accessing financing from different markets and using appropriate instruments and currencies.\n\nReliance continues to enjoy a strong credit rating and continues to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and is rated one notch above sovereign by Moody's.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Treasury Management and Financial Strategy\n\nReliance Treasury makes sure that capital is made available at the optimum risk adjusted cost and is made available at the time when businesses require it. It also ensures maintaining a prudent mix of funding sources across instrument classes, financing products, geographical markets and investor classes.\n\nThe highlight of financing activity in FY 2020-21, was an early prepayment of US$7.8 billion of long-term foreign currency debt, undertaken in 2Q and 3Q FY 2021, with requisite approvals from the RBI. This is the highest ever prepayment of debt undertaken by any corporate borrower in India.\n\nDuring FY 2020-21, the Company took over Reliance Holding USA, Inc, (RHUSA) debt of US$4,455 million. These debts were guaranteed / supported by the letter of comfort given by the Company. Subsequent to its acquisition, the Company refinanced a portion of debt aggregating US$2,455 million, most of which was maturing during FY 2020-21 in compliance with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Regulations, 2018. This refinancing was achieved at the lowest pricing in over a decade for the applicable tenor.\n\nIn order to shore up its liquidity buffer and to insure the Company against risks of volatile business cashflow, Reliance raised ' 24,955 crore through rupee debentures for up to 5 years tenor, during the lockdown period in 1Q FY 2021.\n\n## Credit Rating\n\nReliance's financial discipline and prudence are reflected in the strong credit ratings ascribed by rating agencies. The table below depicts the credit rating profile:\n\n| Instrument         | Rating Agency   | Rating   | Remarks                                    |\n|--------------------|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|\n| International Debt | S&P             | BBB+     | Two notches above India's sovereign rating |\n| International Debt | Moody's         | Baa2     | One notch above India's sovereign rating   |\n| Long-Term Debt     | CRISIL          | AAA      | Highest rating by CRISIL                   |\n| Long-Term Debt     | CARE            | AAA      | Highest rating by CARE                     |\n| Long-Term Debt     | ICRA            | AAA      | Highest rating by ICRA                     |\n\n## Ratings Definitions\n\nS&P BBB+: An obligation rated BBB+ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.\n\nMoody's Baa2: Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.\n\nCRISIL AAA: Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.\n\nCARE AAA: Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.\n\nICRA AAA: Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry the lowest credit risk.\n\n## Liquidity and Treasury Management\n\nReliance maintains a strong focus on liquidity to ensure that the Group always has adequate cover to face any potential short-term market disruptions. Reliance maintained a strong liquidity position in its balance sheet in the form of cash and cash equivalents. Cashflow from operating activities continued to remain strong. The slowdown in hydrocarbons was compensated by the strong growth in consumer businesses.\n\nReliance's liquidity management and investment plans are created within the context of its strategic and annual financial planning processes. The plans are reviewed on an ongoing\n\nbasis to factor in evolving global and domestic macro factors.\n\nReliance maintains sufficient working capital resources for running all its businesses smoothly. It continuously monitors and optimises working capital requirements by actively leveraging trade financing solutions covering receivable and payment products and executing innovative structured trade products.\n\nThe investment portfolio balances well between the dual objectives of generating optimal returns with appropriate risk/reward and maintaining the assurance of liquidity at short notice.",

It also presents multiple opportunities and risks that are managed through the robust Risk Management Framework. The framework helps the Group identify, assess, respond to and monitor, on a real-time basis, risks that impact business objectives. Risk management is an integral component of the Reliance Management System. Effective risk management with enhanced use of technology has improved the quality of business decisions.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management at Reliance\n\nGlobal events have challenged nearly every company, leading to a rethink of assumptions and adaption of strategies to a new operating environment that involves managing major risks with a renewed focus on the safety of people. At Reliance, the Risk Management Function, enabled by the effective use of new technologies, has enhanced the organisation's readiness in responding to COVID-19.\n\nThe Company has a well-established 'Three Lines of Defense' approach:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness/Process Managers (Self-verification, first line of defense)\n\nRisk Management Function (Functional Assurance, second line of defense)\n\nInternal Audit and Management Assurance Function (Independent Assurance, third line of defense)\n\nThe framework and related processes seek to maximise business outcomes by allowing the management to:\n\n- \u00b7 Understand the risk environment and assess the overall potential exposure\n- \u00b7 Determine risk mitigation strategies\n- \u00b7 Allocate resources and actively manage those risks\n- \u00b7 Monitor the effectiveness of risk management - across the value chain and all the way up to the Board\n\nSrikanth Venkatachari\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company is prone to the following categories of risk:\n\nStrategic and commercial risks\n\nFinancial risks\n\nCompliance and control risks\n\nHealth, safety and environment risks\n\nThese risks, either separately or in combination, could have a materially adverse effect on the implementation of Reliance's strategy, its business, financial performance, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, prospects, shareholder value and returns, and reputation.\n\n## Governance Framework\n\nReliance's Risk Management Framework is designed to be a simple, consistent and clear framework for managing and reporting risks from the Group's operations to the Board. The Board provides oversight through various Risk and Executive Committees listed below:\n\n## The Board Committees\n\n- Risk Management Committee\n- Audit Committee\n- Stakeholders' Relationship Committee\n- CSR and Governance Committee\n- Finance Committee\n- HR, Nomination and Remuneration Committee\n- Health, Safety and Environment Committee\n\nBusiness Risk and Assurance Committees (BRAC), which meet on a monthly basis for Business and Strategic Risk Management\n\nBusiness and Functional Leaders: Functional assurance and monitoring on an on-going basis and weekly LOD meetings\n\nThe cadence of governance meetings, including weekly meeting of the three lines of defense, reinforces early identification of a new risk and its mitigation.\n\nFor understanding the Company's corporate governance and functioning of the Board and details on Internal Controls, please refer to the Board's Report and Corporate Governance Report\n\nThe Risk Management Framework covers risk management activities at three levels:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Day-to-Day Risk Management\n\nThis includes identification and mitigation of risks by the management and staff at Reliance's entities, assets and functions. This is executed as an embedded component in the Operating Management System, Financial Management System and People Management System.\n\n## Oversight and Governance\n\nThe Board, Executive Committees, Group and functional leadership provide oversight to the identification and management of the most significant risks and are also responsible for improving the Risk Management Framework and ensuring compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business and Strategic Risk Management\n\nThis is executed by business, function and Group leadership. It also results in integration of risks with key business processes such as strategy, planning and execution, performance management and resource allocation.\n\n## Executive Committees\n\nGroup Operational Risk Committee\n\nGroup Financial Risk Committee\n\nGroup Audit & Disclosure Committee\n\nGroup Compliance Committee\n\nGroup People Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## RISKS AND RESPONSE\n\n## STRATEGIC AND COMMERCIAL RISKS\n\n## Commodity Prices and Markets\n\n## Risk Description\n\nThe risk arising out of COVID-19 - from social distancing, national lockdown, uncertainty in environment, demand contraction, government intervention (ranging from encouraging certain businesses to indirect stoppage of goods and services) - has overshadowed the entire year.\n\nExternal market conditions, in particular; prices of crude oil, natural gas and downstream products have a direct impact on RIL's financial performance. These prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Factors that influence fluctuations in crude prices, crude availability and that can have an impact on margins include operational issues, natural disasters, political instability, including geopolitical risks, economic conditions and aggressive pricing by competitors. Stringent recycling norms and government regulations can reduce plastic consumption.\n\nGovernment restrictions on account of the COVID-19 pandemic could affect smooth operation of business activities, store operation, and expansion. Reliance's inability to build infrastructure at a pace and scale needed by the rapidly growing Retail business could hinder operational efficiency and demand fulfilment.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nSince RIL operates an integrated O2C business, some of these risks in one part of the business are offset by gains in other parts of the Group's integrated O2C business.\n\nRIL exports its products to diverse geographical locations so that the risk of non-evacuation is mitigated with minimal adverse effect. The Company increased the usage of multimodal logistics (including coastal) to fulfil its contractual commitment to customers. The Company operated at near full throughput even during the lockdown period.\n\nThe risk of non-availability of crude and feedstock is actively managed by sourcing crude from multiple geographies using short-term and long-term purchase contracts. As OPEC and other producer countries implemented a coordinated production cut, RIL diversified its feedstock supply sources to ensure adequate and timely availability of feedstock. It also increased Straightrun Fuel Oil (SRFO) sourcing to mitigate risk of lower availability\n\nof heavy crude oil. Reliance has a robust Commodity Risk Management Policy and Framework that enables hedging the exposures arising from commodity price fluctuations, such that the risks remain within acceptable levels.\n\nIn its downstream business, RIL explored new opportunities for manufacturing surgical gowns, PPE, masks, testing-swabs for medical application. RIL is advocating in favour of the environment on the basis of life cycle studies of plastics vs alternatives, and is focusing on plastic waste collection and disposal, increasing recycling footprint in the country.\n\nReliance Retail undertakes regular assessment of emerging risks and opportunities and has implemented necessary steps in securing its people and business in the volatile and uncertain operating environment posed by COVID-19.\n\nDecisive actions were taken by the business to adapt and strengthen\n\nits operating models by activating digital commerce platforms and strengthening omni-channel capabilities.\n\nThe business made steady progress in bringing New Commerce to life by extending partnerships with merchants and becoming their trusted partner.\n\nProactive steps were taken to engage with customers through initiatives such as distance selling, store on wheels, pop up stores among others to ensure customers are served well in the most difficult times.\n\nWith operating curbs lifted progressively, thrust on expansion continued as the business opened new stores across geographies and maintained its pace and scale of growth.\n\n## Customer Experience and Retention\n\n## Risk Description\n\nDigital Services now has over 426 million customers on the back of an innovative customer acquisition strategy. Along with the expansion of its current customer base, customer retention and experience are of utmost importance to generate sustainable business performance and return on investments. The business needs to continuously deliver differentiated customer experience to proactively mitigate any risks that may weaken its value proposition, brand and customer loyalty.\n\nReliance Retail operates in the consumer sector and a slowdown in macro-economic growth and weak consumer sentiments and spending could have a bearing on its performance. In a fast-changing external environment, with evolving customer preferences and shopping habits, inability of the retail business to stay abreast of these trends and behaviours could weaken its compelling value proposition and offering for customers and overall customer experience.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nDigital Services sustains its customer value proposition through continuous innovation on products/service offerings, considering the needs of various customer segments and affordability. It makes continual investments in operational excellence and network infrastructure to deliver superior customer experience. Through its Prime Membership Program, the Company offers the most competitive monthly tariff plans in the industry, apart from offering attractive deals, thereby ensuring customer retention and loyalty.\n\nDigital business has swiftly taken multiple steps for superior customer experience, including multiple\n\n## Data Privacy Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nDue to COVID-19, the companies are collecting personal information about the medical condition of employees, vendors and other visitors to their premises. Reliance is required to comply with statutory, regulatory and contractual restrictions with respect to the collection of data, its storage, its security and dissemination to manage data privacy risk.\n\nThe Government introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDP 2019) in Parliament, which would create the first cross-sectoral legal framework for data protection in India. Currently, the data privacy requirements are governed by the Information Technology Act 2000, amendment 2008.\n\nCitizens and governments across the globe continue to face data breaches and scandals. This has transformed the way citizens, governments and organisations think about data privacy globally. Data privacy laws and societal expectation are increasing the imperatives to protect personal information of individuals.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance continues to ensure that privacy principles are enshrined in the organisation and its services. Since Reliance is also involved in providing health support during the pandemic to both employees and society at large, the data privacy requirements as per the law are tightly integrated\n\ninto business processes and utmost care is taken to validate these regularly. Enhanced practices are in place to ensure protection of personal data while sharing it with third parties. Identified applications that store personal data are adequately secured. Besides, data privacy\n\nawareness campaigns are conducted on an ongoing basis. Reliance is fully compliant with the existing Indian privacy laws and is gearing up to adopt requirements of the anticipated Indian PDP Bill, 2019.\n\noptions to its customers for mobile recharges, scaling up virtual call centres for customer support and resuming store operations with the lifting of the lockdown. It enhanced network capacity for better indoor coverage and, above all, has been continuously driving improvement in the quality of service. The Company continues to develop new products and services on the back of next generation technologies such as AI, IoT and 5G networks.\n\nReliance Retail continuously undertakes market study to stay abreast of the emerging trends and implements proactive measures to ensure that the customer promise\n\nis delivered. It continues to drive consumption in emerging categories resulting from evolving customer preferences and shopping habits, thereby enabling sustained demand across businesses.\n\nFocus on developing own brand portfolio in categories such as health and immunity boosting food in Grocery, productivity devices and appliances in Consumer Electronics, serving 'at home' lifestyle through re-curation of range in Apparel are some of the ways in which business has kept pace with changing consumer habits.\n\n.",

Reliance continues to focus on large scale digital transformation/adoption of technology across its Retail business. A digital security breach or disruption to digital infrastructure caused by intentional or unintentional actions, such as cyber-attacks, data breaches or human error, could have a serious impact on business. This impact could include loss of process control, impact on business continuity or damage to assets and services, harm to the environment, loss of sensitive data or information, legal and regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage as well as revenue loss.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nThe Company subjects its networks and systems to security penetration tests on a continuous basis. Reliance invests significant resources to ensure cybersecurity resilience and data protection. Periodically, independent assessments are carried out to validate and improve resilience to cybersecurity attacks. These encompass technical security controls, secure operational\n\nprocesses, cybersecurity incident monitoring mechanisms, disaster recovery controls and trained manpower. Cybersecurity controls are ensured at design stage through its integration with DeVSecOps. Reliance's cybersecurity measures are aligned to the growth and diversification of the Company. Reliance's Hydrocarbon and Digital businesses are now re-certified with\n\nISO 27001 security benchmark and Reliance Retail is now re-certified with the global PCI DSS 3.2 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). Reliance exchanges cybersecurity intelligence with industry peers and government bodies. Cybersecurity awareness training and tests are conducted for every employee and partner.\n\n## SAFETY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Risks in Operations\n\n## Risk Description\n\nHSE risks include the effects of natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, among others) and safety lapses on human capital. The nature of Reliance operations exposes the Company, its employees and the society, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks due to the geographical location and technical complexity of operations. Various HSE regulations across geographies regulate Reliance's business of Exploration & Production of oil and gas, and their further refining and downstream processing. HSE risk in retail extends to food safety.\n\nA major HSE incident, such as fire, oil spill and security breach, can result in loss of life, environmental degradation and overall disruption in business activities.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nOil to Chemicals (O2C) business poses risks inherent to Oil & Gas operations involving fire, explosion, spills and chemical releases. With an endeavour to mitigate these risks throughout the operating life cycle, robust practices are embedded to manage Safety and Operational risks across the business entities.\n\nHSE risks, including process safety, are identified through a systematic risk assessment programme starting from project ideation, design, commissioning, normal operations\n\nup to the decommissioning phase. Advanced risk assessment techniques are applied to assess the HSE risks periodically, recognise emerging risks and embed appropriate controls. Reliance facilities have employed inherently safer design strategies and state-of-the-art controls in the hazardous processes that reduce vulnerability of these facilities to HSE incidents. These risks are owned and actively managed at asset-facing level. Every member of the workforce is communicated on the potential\n\nexposure to these risks and they are an integral part of risk management.\n\nDuring the year, the industry has faced challenges in managing the health of personnel, supply chain, competent resources to manage hazardous facilities and adherence to practices for managing health of assets. Reliance has proactively reached out to industry peers, industry forums and have actively participated in industry efforts like 'Reflections from global process safety leaders during and following pandemics' by the\n\n## Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Risks in Operations\n\nCentre for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) for mutual learnings. The Company has actively learnt from external HSE incidents in the industry and strengthened its systems and processes. Guidelines and advisories on 'Health and Safety management during pandemic' have been promptly developed and deployed, considering the new-normal conditions. Reliance's central technical teams have been agile in engaging with various expert groups to timely facilitate resources to the sites for troubleshooting, maintenance and oversight to ensure that there are no deviations in HSE practices.\n\nThe Company has taken multiple steps with respect to employees including work from home,\n\nbio-bubbles at manufacturing locations, AI monitoring of behaviour, health monitoring, medical support via online daily symptom check and remote doctor consultation and tie-ups with private hospital chains to ensure medical facilities are available for Reliance employees and their family. Suitable online programmes were organised to keep morale high and ensure the mental well-being of employees. Reliance has ensured required technical competencies were always available to operate and maintain its facilities. Dynamic risk management actions were devised in its operations as the scenario progressed during the pandemic, enabled by digitally connected technology. Risk assessments and oversight activities\n\n## Safety and Environmental Risks During Transportation\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWith most of the crude being supplied to RIL by sea vessel, and the overwhelming majority of refined products being exported by sea, road and pipeline, the Company faces the risk of HSE incidents, oil spills and so on, leading to disruption in business activities.\n\nEvents like technical integrity failure, natural disasters, extreme weather, human error and other adverse events or conditions could lead to loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials, as well as fires, explosions or other personal and process safety incidents.\n\nRIL is operating a fleet of tugs, port service vessels and operations of port and terminal infrastructure and is exposed to a complex and diverse range of marine risks, with respect to exploration vessels, oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas tankers, and dry cargo vessels.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nRIL has a strong vessel vetting, incident monitoring and emergency response system.\n\nRIL's augmented ship vetting programme ensures, the vessels that are contracted to carry RIL Cargo are screened based on risks prior to their induction. The third party ship vetting system based on extensive data analysis narrows the risk arising,\n\nin case physical inspection of vessels is not carried out due to COVID-19. Vendor management audits are carried out at prescribed intervals for time charters and STS service providers in accordance with the Marine Assurance Framework.\n\nRIL's control framework for road transportation has matured over a period of time and is run in\n\ncollaboration with contractors. The contractors are supported by the Company through capacity building for their drivers in areas such as defensive driving, route hazard mapping and real time tracking. A dedicated state-of-the-art emergency response centre provides emergency response to transporters.\n\n.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nlike process monitoring, HSE auditing and safety reviews were seamlessly supplemented by remote collaboration digitally. For Grocery business, food safety checks have been implemented to provide multiple layers of assurance, thereby ensuring safety of consumers.\n\nReliance has initiated digital safety platform activities underpinned with Industry 4.0 technologies like Big data and predictive analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and IoTs. With digitisation, there will be real-time access of information to management and asset facing personnel for timely intervention and to make safety critical decisions proactively.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

Some of Reliance's sites are subject to natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, lightning and earthquakes.\n\nSome of the network locations, offices, employees and other ecosystems are subject to various forms of intentional or natural disruptions, thereby impacting network availability, customer experience, restoration cost and efforts.\n\nFailure to respond quickly or to be perceived as not responding fast enough in an appropriate manner to either an external or internal crisis, could disrupt the Company's business and operations severely and also damage reputation. The impact of such disruption can severely impact business and operations if the Company is unable to restore or replace critical capacity to the required level within the necessary timeframe.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nGlobal Corporate Security (GCS) a dedicated and distinct function of RIL, de-risks, safeguards and secures the Company. It maintains best-in-class detailed disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans to respond to natural calamities, and any disruption or incident.\n\nThe businesses are provided assurance on an ongoing basis by GCS with respect to the management of security risks affecting its people, assets and operations. It actively monitors the threat landscape to prevent/mitigate risks using cutting-edge technology solutions, seamlessly deployed as a digitalphysical managed service on a platform-based approach. Real-time\n\nsituational awareness has been enhanced and speedy response mechanisms are put in place at critical locations. Regular mock drills/ exercises are conducted, with all the stakeholders for checking the efficacy of the same.\n\nAdditionally, risks pertaining to digital services are uniquely mitigated through integrated response that is facilitated by various teams such as security, customer services, corporate services, network maintenance and the local geographical offices to keep the networks functional, thereby safeguarding Company assets, people security while maintaining customer experience.\n\n## COMPLIANCE AND CONTROL RISKS\n\n## Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\n## Risk Description\n\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny has raised the bar on regulatory compliance. This requires alignment of corporate performance objectives, with regulatory compliance requirements. COVID-19 has led the government to announce a range of notifications which companies need to adopt swiftly and effectively.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance has adopted a digitallyenabled comprehensive compliance management framework. It is updated at regular intervals, and is integrated with business processes, risks and controls. Changes in regulations including COVID-19 induced changes are also tracked and integrated within the\n\nReliance Compliance Management System. The responsibility matrix is cascaded down to a single point of responsibility. Apart from assurance through Three lines of defense, compliances are also periodically monitored at the Group Compliance Committee level.\n\nThe Company's code of conduct, training as well as focus on ensuring 100 % compliance and continuous monitoring have enabled a mature, digitally-enabled compliance framework.\n\nSecurity & Loss Prevention (SLP) proactively supports in reducing pilferage, theft and losses to enable higher business profitability and mitigating risks at Reliance Retail. It is enhanced with a prudent mix of physical security, remote surveillance and data-based audit interventions to foster a safe and secure environment and to protect assets 24X7.\n\nRIL is rolling out an integrated security platform with wide area high-end sensors, seamless electronic communication and AI-based analytics across the enterprise.\n\n.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n## Treasury Risks\n\n## Risk Description\n\nTreasury risks include, among others, exposure to movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Following is the summary of key risks faced by Reliance:\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity across markets initially tightened. However, across markets, central banks almost immediately pressed into action and significantly eased monetary and credit conditions.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nReliance borrows funds from domestic and international markets to meet its long-term and short-term funding requirements. It is subject to risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates. As central banks maintained easy and accommodative monetary policies, interest rates across the world dropped very sharply.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nReliance prepares its financial statements in the Indian rupee, but most of the payables and receivables of the Hydrocarbon business are in US dollars, minimising the cash flow risk on account of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Reliance avails long-term foreign currency liabilities (primarily in USD, Euro and JPY) to fund its capital investments. RIL also avails short-term foreign currency liabilities to fund its working capital.\n\nRupee depreciated sharply against the dollar during the first quarter. However, it soon reversed its trajectory completely and went on to close the year ~3% stronger.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nAs liquidity conditions eased out, Reliance raised ' 24,955 crore of Rupee debentures in the 3 - 5 year tenor to add to its already existing liquidity buffer in 1Q FY 2021. Capital flows received in FY 202021 by way of the Rights Issue and stake sale in Digital and Consumer Retail businesses strengthened RIL's liquidity position further. The Company continues to maintain\n\nsufficient liquidity buffer to meet additional demands that may emerge on account of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nInterest rate risk is normally managed actively through financial derivative instruments available to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities or vice-versa. In FY 2020-21 Reliance benefited significantly on account of the ultra-low interest rate environment\n\nas a large part of its borrowings are floating on short-term benchmark rates.\n\nForeign exchange risk arising from the mismatch of foreign currency assets, liabilities and earnings is tracked and managed within the internal Risk Management Framework and rules that are dynamic to market changes.",

The Company covers the properties on full sum insured basis on replacement value. It also maintains various other types of insurance, such as Erection All Risk for its major capital expenditures projects, Directors' and officers' liability, transit cover, charterers' liability cover and employee benefit insurance policies. The scope of coverage, insurance premiums, policy limits and deductibles are in line with the size of the company and its nature of business.\n\n## Leading Edge Technology - Governance, Risk, Compliance and Audit (GRCA 2.0) Platform\n\nA robust ERP system, data analytics capabilities and GRCA tools are used for risk management. Reliance has transformed risk management during the year to enable real-time risk monitoring with the launch of the GRCA 2.0 Platform . GRCA is an in-house development on open source technology that fosters real-time actionable dashboards that enables real-time risk assessment and its mitigation. It is scalable and agile.\n\n## The Future Ahead\n\nCOVID-19 has been one more litmus test for resilience and adaptability. Based on the deep culture of risk management built over the past years, and supplemented with strong cadence-enabled governance, Reliance has a matured Risk Management Framework enabled by technology.

While the more visible impact is demonstrated in financial health, the non-financial parameters work in close conjunction with linear parameters to directly impact revenues. The Company's ability to balance and tap the opportunities across these parameters is what defines our long-term sustainable value creation potential.\n\nGiven its spread across diverse businesses, Reliance experiences various internal and external factors including technology and research imperatives, maintaining supportive community relations, staying abreast of changing customer needs, talent management and contributing to reducing environmental impact. This in turn has a bearing on our financial performance.\n\nReliance understands the importance of monitoring these aspects and to predict, pre-empt and respond with agility to emerging risks and opportunities. The Company adopts a conjunctive approach to draw on the interconnectedness of the capitals to address business realities today, and achieve future aspirations.\n\nThis approach has helped the Company take better, informed decisions to grow/uni00A0business.\n\nTo ensure greater transparency and accountability to its stakeholders and further fuel its commitment towards sustainable business practices and models, Reliance integrated ESG goals in its approach to creating value. The disclosures made in the report are shaped by industry best practices and universally acceptable standards and frameworks such as GRI, IIRC, TCFD, SDGs and WEF-IBC metrics. Reliance is one of the early firms to commit to WEF-IBC, an over-arching framework that aims to converge leading sustainability standards and bring greater comparability and consistency to the Company's ESG reporting disclosures.\n\nIn this report, Reliance has portrayed its value creation story by aligning to the six capitals of the Integrated Reporting <IR> framework laid down by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) natural capital, human capital, manufactured capital, intellectual capital, financial capital and social and relationship/uni00A0capital.\n\n## 138 Standing with the Nation\n\n## 139 Business Resilience during COVID-19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatural Capital 144\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Managing  environmental impacts\n- \u00b7  Air emissions management\n- \u00b7  Water management\n- \u00b7  Waste management\n- \u00b7  Energy efficiency operations\n- \u00b7  Renewable and  alternative energy\n- \u00b7  Ecosystems and biodiversity\n- \u00b7  Contributing to circular economy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntellectual Capital 160\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Leveraging intellectual capital to fight COVID-19\n- \u00b7  Innovation and technology\n- \u00b7  Research and Technology (R&T) focus on:\n- -Clean Energy & Climate Action\n- -Circular Economy\n- -Bio-Innovation\n\nNOTICE\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\n## 140 Stakeholders - At the Core of Reliance's Growth Strategy\n\n## 142 Integrated Thinking and Interplay of Capitals\n\nHuman Capital 148\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Prioritising employee well-being\n- \u00b7  Ensuring health and safety\n- \u00b7  Robust governance and code of conduct\n- \u00b7  Fostering diversity and inclusion\n- \u00b7  Nurturing people-first culture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Capital 164\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Economic performance\n- \u00b7  Business performance\n- \u00b7  Largest ever capital raise in India\n- \u00b7  Robust balance sheet and high liquidity\n\nSocial and Relationship Capital 168\n\n- \u00b7  Community development\n- \u00b7  Customer satisfaction\n- \u00b7  Supply chain management\n\nManufactured Capital 154\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Digital inclusion and innovation\n- \u00b7  Smart manufacturing\n- \u00b7  Raw material security\n- \u00b7  Asset protection and security\n- \u00b7  Data security and privacy\n- \u00b7  Managing systemic risk and disruption",

This is a time when Reliance stands strong with India and reaffirms its commitment to offer support in whatever way possible to help the country navigate through these trying times. Every member of the Reliance family is guided by the mission 'Corona Haarega, India Jeetega'.\n\nThe Company's first and foremost priority is to support the country in this hour of need. Reliance Foundation has supported the setting up & management of over 2,300 beds across various locations including setting up a 1,000-bed COVID care facility in Jamnagar. Earlier, Reliance, in partnership with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), set up India's first exclusive COVID-19 hospital in just two weeks - a national record. Managed by the Reliance Foundation Hospital, the facility now accommodates 875 beds including 145/uni00A0ICU beds in Mumbai.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough the year, more than 1,00,000 masks and PPEs have been manufactured  and supplied to health workers and caregivers per day. Reliance is providing free fuel to emergency vehicles. Reliance Life Sciences has enhanced India's COVID-19 testing capabilities by developing its own confirmatory tests and is in the process of expanding this testing capacity.  Through Mission Anna Seva, Reliance has provided over 5.5 crore meals to frontline workers and vulnerable communities.  While COVID-19 has disrupted livelihoods, Reliance added over 75,000 jobs to the economy. While Reliance is committed to serving the nation, its focus on the health and safety of its employees and their families remains unwavering. It continues to focus on ensuring the health and safety of its employees and their families. The Company, thus, announced the\n\nR-Surakshaa vaccination programme for all eligible employees and their family members. Deploying an extremely\n\nThe pandemic has created a dearth of medical oxygen in the country. To help India overcome the scarcity, facilities at the Jamnagar refineries have been repurposed to deliver 1,000 MT of medicalgrade oxygen per day to be supplied to states, which is expected to benefit over 1,00,000 people per day. This makes it one of the largest producers of medical-grade oxygen from a single location in the country. Reliance engineers are making smart logistical modifications to rail and road transport to overcome bottlenecks and ensure oxygen reaches those in need.\n\nThe cascading effect of COVID-19 on the global and Indian economy has been hard. Despite the challenges, Reliance has been able to garner significant foreign investments and raise capital and is net debt free today.\n\nOperationally for key businesses it was a year of two halves. O2C and Retail business were impacted in the first-half due to demand destruction and operational constraints. Sharp rebound in economic activity in the secondhalf helped the businesses deliver a resilient full year performance. Digital Services business has been a key life-line for India during the pandemic and delivered robust growth in operational and financial performance for the year.\n\nIn the past year, Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail raised ' 152,056 crore and ' 47,265 crore, respectively, from marquee global investors such as Facebook, Google, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, ADIA, GIC, TPG , L Catterton, PIF, Intel Capital and Qualcomm Ventures.\n\nGlobal energy leader, bp, invested ' 7,629 crore for a 49% stake in the Company's fuel retailing business. The joint venture between Reliance and bp will build on the Company's current fuel retailing network of 1,400 sites across India. It aims to be a leader in mobility and low-carbon solutions, bringing cleaner and affordable options to Indian consumers, facilitated by digital and technology solutions.\n\nThe challenges of COVID-19 notwithstanding, India remains one of the world's most significant economies powered by its people and growing opportunities. Through FY 2021 -22, Reliance will continue to build a digitalfirst, world-class company focused on value creation that broadens people's access to financial well-being, while running its purpose-driven operations to address India's COVID-19 related needs. In keeping with the vision of Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, Founder Chairman, the Company will continue to foster strong ecosystems and grow holistically led by a multi-stakeholder approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nefficient and  seamless process, Reliance has been able to vaccinate more than 50,000 citizens in its Sir H.

Jio is connecting over 400 million Indians and thousands of organisations, supporting workfrom-home, study-from-home and healthcare-from-home with appropriate solutions. Powered by automation and network virtualisation, Jio has ensured zero impact on its network despite challenges of staff availability and COVID-related restrictions. The Company's plants, ports and sites are working at full utilisation to keep the wheels of the economy moving and to ensure India's fuel and energy security. The entire organisation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhas come together - right from engineering, construction, corporate services, human resources and finance to commercial and security services and corporate affairs - to do everything in its capacity to help fellow Indians.\n\nReliance firmly believes that India will beat the pandemic and emerge stronger and more resilient. The Company is also optimistic that the post-COVID world will see India bounce back as one of the fastest growing economies in the world - one that will continue creating multiple opportunities, developing infrastructure and providing resources for its 1.3 billion people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNOTICE\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW",

Going beyond business imperatives and compliance requirements, this year, Reliance Chairman & Managing Director, Shri Mukesh D. Ambani announced the Company's target to turn Net Carbon Zero by 2035. The Company considers the Net Carbon Zero target as its moral responsibility to protect the earth from the rising impact of climate change.\n\nThe Company has a robust governance approach to monitor, review and refine the way it manages natural capital usage.  Reliance has deployed Company-wide annual environmental and sustainability action plans, which are monitored and reviewed regularly. The Company follows a holistic Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) policy at a Group level that defines Companywide HSE objectives and processes for plant operations to improve operational discipline and HSE performance. The Company has also designed a HSE audit programme to ensure management standards are adhered to across its operations.\n\nThe Group Safety and Operation Risk team periodically monitors the quarterly review of business plans. They also conduct periodic reviews of environmental aspects, independently, at the segment and site levels. The comprehensive review mechanism covers the lifecycle of assets, across their implementation, operating and closure phases. Reliance continues to strengthen its compliance systems and processes through rigorous internal and external audits.\n\nThe many impacts of COVID-19 have made people even more aware of the fragility of our environment and the urgent need to take better care of it. By forging new partnerships and leveraging innovation, Reliance is judiciously utilising the precious natural capital that it needs for its businesses and is striving to leave behind a better planet for future generations.\n\n## Managing Environmental Impacts\n\nThe Company adopts a cross-business approach to reduce environmental footprint. It focuses on the areas of clean air and water, preventing soil contamination, preserving biodiversity, optimal utilisation of resources and digitisation of operations by utilising technology for direct energy savings and online collaborations for reducing travel needs . The Company's state-ofthe-art facilities and seamless adoption of technology solutions ensures sustainability of operations.\n\n## 2 million barrels of the world's first carbon-neutral oil sourced by Reliance\n\n## Air Emissions Management\n\nTo meet India's growing needs for petrochemical building blocks and materials, in the last decade, Reliance\n\nundertook its largest investment cycle in the O2C business. Simultaneously, Reliance invested in creating digital and physical platforms that have sharply enhanced productivity as well as reduced energy intensity for Indian businesses and consumers. Energy and Materials affordability and selfsufficiency, a strong digital backbone and an efficient physical supply-chain infrastructure are key enablers for the next phase of economic growth in India.\n\nThe mega O2C projects executed in the last decade, increased Reliance's downstream production by 65% without materially changing the feedstock requirement of the business. These projects increased crude to chemicals conversion, provided additional feedstock flexibility and optimised energy cost and enhanced self-sufficiency. It cemented Reliance's position as largest, most complex and energy efficient integrated O2C operations globally.\n\n## GHG Emissions\n\n|   Sr | Parameters   | UOM         |   FY2020-21* |   FY2019-20 |   FY2018-19 |   FY2017-18 |\n|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|    1 | Scope 1 CO 2 | million ton |        44.67 |       47.5  |       29.69 |       31.5  |\n|    2 | Scope 2 CO 2 | million ton |         1.25 |        1.45 |        1.14 |        0.82 |\n|    3 | TPM          | '000 ton    |         2.02 |        1.85 |        2.29 |        3.04 |\n|    4 | SO x         | '000 ton    |        21.61 |       22.53 |       22.61 |       22.26 |\n|    5 | NO x         | '000 ton    |        39.88 |       42.01 |       34.43 |       36.73 |\n|    6 | VOC          | '000 ton    |        41.31 |       46.15 |       41.88 |       42.9  |\n\n* For scope refer Independent Assurance Statement on page 176\n\nAs the energy requirement of these mega O2C projects is currently met by conventional energy sources, there has been increase in GHG emissions in FY 2019-20, reflecting the full year of operation of the Cracker complex, and\n\nstabilisation of the Petcoke gasification complex at Jamnagar. While nearly two-third of this increase in emissions is on account of Petcoke which is now consumed in-house instead of being sold to external customers, gasification",

        "page_content": "project has also had multiple beneficial impacts. It has enhanced energy selfsufficiency for Reliance and improved energy security for India. Petcoke gasificaton is also used to maximise Hydrogen production which is rapidly emerging as the fuel of choice to combat climate change and achieve de-carbonisation across industries. It also provides a solid platform to significantly reduce the cost of carbon capture and utilisation by fixing the CO 2 and converting it to value-added chemicals in a sustainable manner. Gasification asset has also become the primarily source of medical grade oxygen, producing over 11% of India's total production and meeting the needs of nearly 1 in every 10 patients.\n\nResponse to climate change will shape new business models and open-up huge opportunity sets to create value through a new energy and materials paradigm. As societal needs evolve, Reliance is committed to participate and lead in the transition to new affordable climate friendly energy and materials. During the year, Reliance unveiled its target to achieve Net Carbon zero by 2035. It also became one of the early firms to commit to WEF-IBC metrics on sustainability reporting. The WEFIBC framework endorses TCFD and provides for a three-year pathway to achieve full TCFD implementation.\n\nThe 6.2% reduction in GHG emissions during FY 2020-21 sets the tenor and trajectory for reduction in Reliance's carbon footprint. The decrease in emissions is an outcome of several initiatives undertaken by RIL which include:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy Conservation and Fuel Mix Optimisation on a real-time basis\n- \u00b7 Deeper integration inside RIL's core business management and processes\n- \u00b7 Adoption of next-gen digital technologies - IoT, AI / ML:\n- -To capture fugitive emissions across the entire value chain sourcing, production, storage, and distribution\n\n- -Predictive maintenance to reduce number of plant slowdowns and shut-downs\n- \u00b7 Consolidation, optimisation, and integration of operations across O2C sites - post commissioning and stabilisation of all O2C projects\n\nOver the coming years Reliance will deploy further resources - intellectual, physical, and financial and adopt a collaborative approach, to achieve further reduction in Greenhouse Gas emission. The key elements of our carbon reduction strategy include:\n\n- \u00b7 Transition from transportation fuels to chemical building blocks integrated with sustainable downstream derivatives\n- \u00b7 Transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels for captive energy demand\n- \u00b7 Maximising use of biofuels and using bio-pathways to fix CO 2 and facilitate conversion to renewable fuels and materials\n- \u00b7 Scaling up recycling of materials and maximising circularity across the value chains\n- \u00b7 Achieving CO 2 capture, storage and conversion to useful chemicals and materials at competitive costs\n\nReliance will continue to upgrade the strategy and roadmap with an endeavor to achieve Net Carbon Zero target sooner than 2035.\n\n## Water Management\n\nWater is a critical resource for Reliance's businesses. It has adopted a holistic and climate-conscious approach to manage water-related risks. The Company manages and monitors the amount of water withdrawn, discharged and recycled across its operations.\n\nReliance takes proactive steps to recycle water using state-of-the-art technologies to reduce freshwater dependency. Treated effluents are reused in the cooling towers, for horticulture activities and in firewater networks. The Company's world-class desalination unit at the Jamnagar facility is a testimony of its commitment to\n\ncreating sustainable sources of water. The key performance parameters that are being tracked in our Hydrocarbon business are mentioned below:\n\n## 219 million /K001L Total water withdrawn\n\n## 33 million /K001L Water discharged\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n99 million /K001L Water recycled\n\n## Collaboration with Forest Essentials under #GoGreenWithFE\n\nR|Elan\u2122 collaborated with Forest Essentials\u2122, the Ayurvedabased skincare and perfume brand, to encourage recycling of used plastic packaging. Forest Essentials\u2122 incentivised customers through a rewards programme to discard empty jars and bottles into a specially created collection facility at its major stores.  This waste will be processed and repurposed to make GreenGold\u2122 fibre and fabric used to make apparel, bags and other items.\n\n## Waste Management\n\nReliance is a firm believer in the 3Rs of circular economy - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. To improve circularity in plastics, the Company collects, sorts and recycles plastics to reduce dependency on new and virgin resources.\n\nThe Company's waste management strategy undertakes the following initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Adopting responsible plastic and e-waste management strategies across Reliance Retail.  It is now authorised to collect e-waste and fulfil extended producer responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Recycling discarded PET bottles into fabric such as Recron Green Gold. We plan to more than double our recycling capabilities to about 5 billion PET bottles annually\n- \u00b7 Sponsoring more than 100 reverse vending machine installations across major cities to enhance public awareness about plastic waste\n- \u00b7 Using bioplastic for packaging and agricultural applications\n- \u00b7 Using flexible plastic waste in road making through our initiative, ReRoute\n- \u00b7 Transforming Multi Layered Packaging (MLP) waste to stable oil at refineries and O2C plants to produce plastics again\n- \u00b7 Recycling hazardous waste for use as alternate fuels and raw material for cement industries\n\n## Energy Efficiency Operations\n\nMeasures such as replacement with LED  at retail stores, translucent roofsheets at the warehouses, design changes to enhance natural lighting at the stores and wet cleaning of HVAC systems have contributed significantly to improving the Company's energy efficiency.\n\nFor its Digital Services business, the Company has put in place certain energy-saving systems that ensure one of the lowest carbon intensities per TB of data usage compared to other service providers.\n\nAcross manufacturing sites, the Company has taken up several energy optimisation projects, waste heat recovery projects, opportunistic equipment upgrades and phase-wise implementation of Advance Process Control & Real Time Optimiser (APC & RTO) systems to improve on energy efficiency and resource conservation.\n\n## 51,47,687 GJ Energy saved\n\n## Renewable and Alternative Energy\n\n## Reliance has increased the use of renewable energy to power its operations.\n\nThe Company has installed rooftop solar panels, conducted trials of co-firing biomass with coal and invested in alternate energy solutions such as fuel cells and biofuels. These steps are helping the Company steadily reduce its dependency on conventional fuels.\n\n## 6,91,217 GJ Renewable energy used for Company operations\n\n## Ecosystems and Biodiversity\n\nReliance conducts periodic environmental impact studies for its greenfield and brownfield projects to evaluate and mitigate ecosystem impact.

This water is being channelised to 55 farm ponds built in or around adjacent farms or nearby wells, which in turn has helped 350 farmers undertake round-the-year farming across 750 acres and increase earnings. Further, existing ponds are being deepened and desilted to increase their capacities. Over 1 lakh  KL of water has been conserved and reused through these farm ponds.\n\nReliance Foundation partnered with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to launch the WomenConnect India Challenge to support innovative solutions to close the gender-digital divide.\n\nIn addition, during the year, livelihood trainings were conducted in collaboration with various agencies, covering over 1,700 Self Help Groups (SHGs) supported by end-to-end mentoring, bank and government department linkages.\n\n## Delivering healthcare, safety and hope\n\nInterior rural areas suffer from lack of adequate local healthcare facilities. Mobile Medical Units (MMU) play a key role in augmenting primary healthcare capacities in these areas.\n\nImpacted by the pandemic, Shreemati Poonam Baiga, the pregnant wife of a migrant worker, had to return to her native village Shahdol with no means to take care of her medical expenses. Lack of prenatal and antenatal care and institutional deliveries lead to high infant mortality rates in India. The MMUs run by Reliance Foundation provided her with the imperative health checkups, counselling, medicines and supplements. They also ensured regular check-ups to help her give safe birth. Four Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) run by Reliance Foundation provide critical primary care to 150 villages of Shahdol, Kotma and other villages in the Shahdol-Phulpur Gas Pipeline (SHPPL) corridor. These MMUs also helped in complementing government efforts for COVID-19 care and treatment. The Foundation also provided dry ration kits to more than 1,500 poor households and food to 40,000 through a central kitchen at Shahdol village.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water Resources for/uni00A0All\n\nLack of irrigation facilities makes small and marginal farmers susceptible to the vagaries of rains. Chal-Khal is an age-old, simple and costeffective water conservation model popular in Uttarakhand.\n\nIt enriches the soil, recharges groundwater and improves access to water. Led by SHGs and local community members, 41 villagers through 'Shramdaan', or voluntary labour, with the support of Reliance Foundation and local authorities, helped 24 villages in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand to construct two Chal-Khals for their region in March 2021. This enhanced access to water in the region and is improving the water table by recharging groundwater. With the help of Reliance Foundation, over 6,400 ha additional land was brought under irrigation through water harvesting and conservation efforts across India. Additionally, Reliance created over 131 lakh m 3 of rainwater harvesting capacity and improved access to drinking water for 517 villages during FY 2020-21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Livestock Care\n\nLivestock farming generates additional income for farmers, especially in the arid regions where income from agriculture is often poor or uncertain.\n\nKiran Turadkar (45) of Wagdaon village in Chandrapur, Maharashtra runs his household on income from agriculture and livestock farming. When his buffaloes suffered from lumpy skin disease and could not be put to work, he had to pay to hire buffaloes from others. Reliance Foundation Information Services apprised Kiran of a free livestock treatment camp where he got his animals treated and received medicines for them free of cost. Reliance supported and treated over 1.9 lakh livestock through better nutrition, healthcare and animal husbandry practices during FY 2020-21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Joining Hands for Be/t\\_ter Harvest\n\nReliance Foundationmentored Tirkut Krishak Farmer Producer Company in Jharkhand provides affordable inputs to small and marginal farmers\n\nIt establishes the critical forward and backward market linkages to ensure a robust supply chain management for farmers. Pankaj Yadav, a progressive farmer from Jharkhand's Deoghar district was struggling to find seeds when he decided to sow maise in April to improve his yield and go-to-market faster. The FPC, through a Reliance Foundation mentored SHG, not only delivered seeds at Pankaj's doorstep but also provided expertise on innovative farming practices. The Foundation's timely support and Pankaj's hard work helped him take a bountiful harvest early to the market and command a better price. This holistic ecosystem fostered by Reliance Foundation is enhancing livelihoods across India.  Reliance supported 30 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) across 12 states to strengthen market access for 43,000 farmers. These FPOs transacted ' 94 crore worth business and ' 26.2 crore produce sales through digital linkages during FY 2020-21.",

Two athletes from the HPC - Amlan Borgohain and Dilip Naik- participated in the 24 th National Federation Cup in Patiala in March 2021 and returned with Personal Best (PB) timings in the 100m, and in the 800m and 1,500m races, respectively. With proactive support from the state government since operations began in 2019, athletes from the HPC have won at various competitions and progressed rapidly. Borgohain, for instance, has gone from a complete unknown to becoming one of India's best sprinters today. In the past year, he has improved his personal timing by running an incredible 5m faster in the 100m sprint.\n\n## Disaster Response\n\nNatural disasters leave devastating trail on human lives and livelihoods. In developing countries like India with its wide socio-economic gaps, the impact is heightened. Reliance Foundation's disaster response programme offers a two-pronged approach to alleviate the pain of the impacted. The programme provides early warning advisories to build preparedness within communities and ensure speedy response in the immediate aftermath of disasters. Reliance teams on ground directly engage with the affected communities, bringing together its strengths of managing human resources and deploying Information Technology (IT) to provide relief efficiently and effectively.\n\n## Early warning and post-disaster advisories from the Company have reached more than 10 lakh people across 7  states and 2 Union Territories last year.\n\nThrough Reliance Foundation, Reliance extended support to coastal communities impacted by cyclones (Amphan, Nisarga, Burevi and Nivar), the flood-affected communities of Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh and those impacted by locust attacks during FY 2020-21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer Satisfaction Ensuring Sustainable Growth\n\nReliance aims to become the world's most customer-focused company and actively strives to achieve customer delight.

This is the foundation of our growth.'\n\n## Shri Dhirubhai H. Ambani\n\nFounder Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nK. Sethuraman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJyoti Jain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSavithri Parekh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSridhar Kothandaraman\n\nRatnesh Rukhariyar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Corporate Governance is an interplay between people, processes, performance and purpose. Our Values and Behaviours form the bed rock of our Corporate Governance. At RIL, we work towards building an environment of Trust, Transparency and Accountability focusing on the long-term and supporting more inclusive societies.'\n\nThis report is prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations) and the report contains the details of Corporate Governance systems and processes at Reliance Industries Limited (RIL or the Company).\n\nAt RIL, Corporate Governance is all about maintaining a valuable relationship and trust with all the stakeholders. We consider stakeholders as partners in our success and remain committed to maximising stakeholders' value, be it Customers, Local Communities, Employees, Suppliers & Distributors, Trade Unions, NGOs, Investors & Shareholders and Government & Regulatory Authorities. This approach to value creation emanates from RIL's belief\n\nthat sound governance system, based on relationship and trust, is integral to creating enduring value for all. We have a defined policy framework for ethical conduct of businesses. We believe that any business conduct can be ethical only when it rests on the six core values viz. Customer Value, Ownership Mind-set, Respect, Integrity, One Team and Excellence.\n\n## Statement on Company's Philosophy on Code of Governance\n\nCorporate Governance encompasses a set of systems and practices to ensure that the Company's affairs are being managed in a manner which ensures accountability, transparency and fairness in all transactions in the widest sense. The objective is to meet stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. Good\n\ngovernance practices stem from the dynamic culture and positive mindset of the organisation. We are committed to meet the aspirations of all our stakeholders. This is demonstrated in shareholder returns, high credit ratings, awards and recognitions, governance processes and an entrepreneurial performance focussed work environment. Additionally, our customers have benefited from high quality products delivered at extremely competitive prices.\n\nThe essence of Corporate Governance lies in promoting and maintaining integrity, transparency and accountability in the management's higher echelons. The demands of Corporate Governance require professionals to raise their competence and capability levels to meet the expectations in managing the enterprise and its resources effectively with the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhighest standards of ethics. It has thus become crucial to foster and sustain a culture that integrates all components of good governance by carefully balancing the inter-relationship among the Board of Directors, Board Committees, Finance, Compliance & Assurance teams, Auditors and the Senior Management. Our employee satisfaction is reflected in the stability of our senior management, low attrition across various levels and substantially higher productivity. Above all, we feel honoured to be integral to India's social development. Details of several such initiatives are available in the Report on Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAt RIL, we believe that as we move closer towards our aspirations of being a global corporation, our Corporate Governance standards must be globally benchmarked. Therefore, we have institutionalised the right building blocks for future growth. The building blocks will ensure that we achieve our ambition in a prudent and sustainable manner. RIL not only adheres to the prescribed Corporate Governance practices as per the Listing Regulations, but is also committed to sound Corporate Governance principles and practices. It constantly strives to adopt emerging best practices being followed worldwide. It is our endeavour to achieve higher standards and provide oversight and guidance to the management in strategy implementation, risk management and fulfilment of stated goals and objectives.\n\nOver the years, we have strengthened governance practices. These practices define the way how business is conducted and value is generated. Stakeholders' interests are taken into account, before making any business decision. RIL has the distinction of consistently rewarding its shareholders for over four eventful decades from Initial Public Offer (IPO). Since then, RIL has moved from one big idea to another and these milestones continue to fuel its relentless pursuit of ever-higher goals.\n\nOn standalone basis, we have grown by a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Revenues 21.3%, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) before exceptional items 22.8% and Net Profit\n\nNOTICE\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nbefore exceptional items 23.7%. The financial markets have endorsed our sterling performance and the market capitalisation has increased by CAGR of 31.5% during the same period. In terms of distributing wealth to our shareholders, apart from having a track record of uninterrupted dividend payout, we have also delivered consistent unmatched shareholder returns since listing. The result of our initiative is our ever widening reach and recall. Our shareholder base has grown from 52,000 after the IPO to a consolidated present base of around 30 lakh.\n\nFor decades, RIL is growing in step with India's industrial and economic development. The Company has helped transform the Indian economy with large projects and world-class execution. The quest to help elevate India's quality of life continues and is unabated. It emanates from a fundamental article of faith: 'What is good for India is good for Reliance'.\n\nWe believe, Corporate Governance is not just a destination, but a journey to constantly improve sustainable value creation. It is an upward-moving target that we collectively strive towards achieving. Our multiple initiatives towards maintaining the highest standards of governance are detailed in this Report.\n\n## Appropriate Governance Structure with defined Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe Company has put in place an internal governance structure with defined roles and responsibilities of every constituent of the system. The Company's shareholders appoint the Board of Directors, which in turn governs the Company. The Board has established various Committees to discharge its responsibilities in an effective manner. The Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) provides overall direction and guidance to the Board. In the operations and functioning of the Company, the CMD is assisted by four Executive Directors and a core group of senior level executives.\n\nThe Chairman is responsible for fostering and promoting the integrity\n\nof the Board while nurturing a culture where the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit of the Company and all its stakeholders. The Chairman guides the Board for effective governance in the Company.\n\nThe Chairman takes a lead role in managing the Board and facilitating effective communication among Directors. The Chairman actively works with the Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee to plan the Board and Committees' composition, induction of directors to the Board, plan for directors' succession and provide constructive feedback and advice on performance evaluation to directors. The Company Secretary assists the Chairman in management of the Board's administrative activities such as meetings, schedules, agenda, communications and documentation.\n\n## Ethics / Governance Policies\n\nAt RIL, we strive to conduct our business and strengthen our relationships in a manner that is dignified, distinctive and responsible. We adhere to ethical standards to ensure integrity, transparency, independence and accountability in dealing with all the stakeholders. Therefore, we have adopted various codes and policies to carry out our duties in an ethical manner.

The Statutory Auditors and the Group Internal Audit Function perform independent reviews of the ongoing effectiveness of the Reliance Management System which integrates various components of the systems of internal control.\n\n## Risk Management, Internal Controls and Compliance\n\nThe Company has put in place the 'Reliance Management System' (RMS) as a part of its transformation agenda. RMS incorporates an integrated framework for managing risks and internal controls. The internal financial controls have been documented, embedded and digitised in the business processes. Internal controls are regularly tested for design, implementation and operating effectiveness. RMS is enabled through extensive use of technology to support the risk management processes, ensure the ongoing effectiveness of internal controls in processes, compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe Compliance Function ensures compliance activities related to the Financial, Operational and People Management Systems of the various group entities. This includes various statutes such as industrial and labour laws, taxation laws, corporate and securities laws, health, safety and environmental laws, etc. All compliance activities are supported by a robust online compliance monitoring system (iRCMS) to ensure ongoing compliance. The ongoing effectiveness of compliance management activities is reviewed independently by the Group Audit Function.\n\nThe combination of independent governance, assurance and oversight structures, combined with automated risk management, controls and compliance monitoring, ensures robustness and integrity of financial reporting, management of internal controls and ensures compliance with statutory laws, regulations and company's policies. These provide the foundations that enable optimal use and protection of assets, facilitate the accurate and timely compilation of financial statements and management reports.\n\n## Best Corporate Governance practices\n\nRIL strives for highest Corporate Governance standards and practices. It, therefore, endeavours to continuously improve and adopt the best of international Corporate Governance codes and practices. Some of the implemented global governance norms and best practices include the following:\n\n- \u00b7  All securities related filings with the Stock Exchanges are reviewed every quarter by the Stakeholders' Relationship Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Company has independent Board Committees covering matters related to Risk Management, Health Safety and Environment, Corporate Social Responsibility, Internal Audit, Financial Management, Stakeholders' Relationship, Directors' Remuneration and the nomination of Board members.\n- \u00b7  The Company also has several other Executive Committees of senior management who review the ongoing effectiveness of operational\n- and financial risk mitigations and governance practices.\n- \u00b7  The Group has an independent Internal Audit Function that provides risk-based assurance across all material areas of Group Risk and Compliance exposures.\n- \u00b7  The Company undergoes quarterly secretarial compliance certification from an independent company secretary who is in whole-time practice.\n- \u00b7  The Company has appointed an independent firm of Chartered Accountants to conduct concurrent audit of share transfer and other incidental functions carried out by the Registrar and Transfer Agents.\n\n## RIL's Integrated Reporting\n\nRIL published its maiden Integrated Annual Report in the FY 2016-17 aligned with the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC) <IR> framework. The concept of the six capitals of business as suggested by the <IR> framework has been ingrained into the Company's management philosophy and has become an important enabler for RIL's value creation story. RIL's Integrated Reporting is covered in Management Discussion and Analysis Report.\n\n## Shareholders' Communications\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of two-way communication with shareholders, giving a balanced report of results and progress and responding to questions and issues raised. Shareholders seeking information related to their shareholding may contact the Company directly or through the Company's Registrar and Transfer Agents, details of which are available on the Company's website. RIL ensures that complaints of its shareholders are responded to promptly. A comprehensive and informative Shareholders' Referencer is available on the website of the Company.\n\n## Role of the Company Secretary in overall Governance Process\n\nFunctions of the Company Secretary are discharged by the Group Company\n\nSecretary and the Joint Company Secretary. The Company Secretary plays a key role in ensuring that the Board (including its Committees thereof) procedures are followed and regularly reviewed. The Company Secretary ensures that all relevant information, details and documents are made available to the Directors and senior management for effective decision-making at the meetings. The Company Secretary is primarily responsible to assist and advice the Board in the conduct of affairs of the Company, to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements, to\n\n| CORPORATE   | GOVERNANCE  MANAGEMENT   | NOTICE  FINANCIAL   |\n|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| OVERVIEW    | REVIEW                   | STATEMENTS          |\n\nprovide guidance to the Directors and to facilitate convening of meetings.

The Board's actions and decisions are aligned with the Company's best interests. The Board is committed to the goal of\n\nsustainably elevating the Company's value creation.

The Committee inter alia considers qualification, positive attributes, area of expertise and number of Directorship(s) and Membership(s) held in various committees of other companies by such persons in accordance with the Company's Policy for Selection of Directors and determining Directors' independence. The Board considers the Committee's recommendation and takes appropriate decision.\n\nEvery Independent Director, at the first meeting of the Board in which he / she participates as a Director and thereafter at the first meeting of the Board in every financial year, gives a declaration that he / she meets the criteria of independence as provided under the\n\nlaw and that he / she is not aware of any circumstance or situation, which exist or may be reasonably anticipated, that could impair or impact his / her ability to discharge his / her duties with an objective independent judgement and without any external influence.\n\nIn the opinion of the Board, the Independent Directors fulfil the conditions specified in the Listing Regulations and are independent of the management.\n\n## Meetings of Independent Directors\n\nThe Company's Independent Directors met four times during the financial year 2020-21. Such meetings were conducted to enable the Independent Directors to discuss matters pertaining to the Company's affairs and put forth their views.\n\n## Board Meetings, Committee Meetings and Procedures\n\n## Institutionalised decision-making process\n\nThe Board of Directors is the apex body constituted by shareholders for overseeing the Company's overall functioning.\n\nThe Board provides and evaluates the Company's strategic direction, management policies and their effectiveness and ensures that shareholders' long-term interests are being served.\n\nThe Board has constituted seven main Committees, viz. Audit Committee, Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Stakeholders' Relationship Committee, Corporate Social Responsibility and Governance Committee, Risk Management Committee, Health, Safety and Environment Committee and Finance Committee and is authorised to constitute other functional Committees, from time to time, depending on business needs.\n\nThe Company's internal guidelines for Board / Committee meetings facilitate decision-making process at its meetings in an informed and efficient manner.\n\n## Number of Board Meetings\n\nEight Board meetings were held during the financial year, as against the statutory requirement of four meetings.

We believe\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## A. Capitalisation and useful life of property, plant and equipment\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company has incurred capital expenditure on various projects included in capital work in progress and intangible assets under development. Further, items of property, plant and equipment that are ready for its intended use as determined by the management have been capitalised in the current year. Judgement is involved to determine that the aforesaid capitalisation meet the recognition requirement under Ind AS specifically in relation to determination of whether the criteria for intended use of the management has been met.\n\nFurther, in the current year, the Company has reassessed the useful life of its plant and machinery from 25-35 years to 50 years. Assessment of useful life of plant and machinery involves management judgement, technical assessment, consideration of historical experiences, anticipated technological changes, etc.\n\nAccordingly, the above has been determined as a key audit matter.\n\n- Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n- \u00b7  Examined the management assessment of the assumptions considered in estimation of useful life.\n- \u00b7  Examined the useful economic lives with reference to the Company's historical experience and technical evaluation by third party specialist appointed by management.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Company's external specialists involved in the process.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the nature of the additions made to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets,  capital work-in-progress and intangible asset under development on a test check basis to test whether they meet the recognition criteria as set out in para 16 to 22 of Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment, including intended use of management.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the impact recognised on account of the change in the useful life and disclosure made in the financial statements.\n\nStandalone\n\nNOTICE\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nthat the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to Note 31(b) and 41.1 of the financial statements in respect of the Scheme of Amalgamation of wholly-owned subsidiaries with the Company approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai, wherein the financial information has been restated from the appointed date and not from the earliest date presented in accordance with Ind AS 103, as per General Circular No. 09/2019 issued by MCA dated August 21, 2019 and loss due to take over of borrowing and consequential adjustment for reversal thereof in the statement of profit and loss upon the Scheme becoming effective.\n\nOur Opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements.

        "page_content": "## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nB. Estimation of oil reserves, decommissioning liabilities, depletion charges and impairment evaluation of development rights\n\nRefer to Note 34.2 on proved reserves and production on product and geographical basis, Note C(A) on estimation of Oil and Gas reserves, Note B.2(s) on Accounting for Oil and Gas activity, Note C(B) on Decommissioning Liabilities, Note C(C) on Property Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets and Note B.2(j) on Provisions and Note B.2(i) on impairment of non-financial assets and Note 17 of the financial statements.\n\nThe determination of the Company's oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells and commodity prices all impacts the determination of the Company's estimates of oil and natural gas reserves.\n\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Company's oil and gas assets. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset's carrying values reported in the financial statements.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, value in use has been determined by the management by considering estimates such as discount rates, reserves and volumes, future oil and gas natural prices etc. along with other macro-economic, business and financing factors.\n\nFurther, the recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves use of estimates and assumptions relating to timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\n\nAccordingly, the same is considered as a key audit matter.\n\n## C. Litigation matters\n\nThe Company has certain significant ongoing legal proceedings for various complex matters with the Government of India and other parties, continuing from earlier years, which are as under:\n\n## 1. Matters in relation to Oil and Gas:\n\n- (a) Disallowance of certain costs under the production sharing contract, relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 and consequent deposit of differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field to the gas pool account maintained by Gail (India) Limited (Refer Note 34.3).\n- (b) Claim against the Company in respect of gas said to have migrated from neighbouring blocks (KGD6) (Refer Note 34.4(a)).\n- (c) Claims relating to limits of cost recovery, profit sharing and audit and accounting provisions of the public sector corporations etc., arising under two production sharing contracts entered into in 1994 (Refer Note 34.4(b)).\n- (d) Suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court (Refer Note 34.4(c)).\n\n## 2. Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited ('RPL'):\n\n- (a) Special Appellate Tribunal judgement dated November 5, 2020, dismissing Company's appeal made in relation to order passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI') under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 (Refer Note 35(III)).\n\nOur work included and were not limited to the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7  Performed walk-through of the estimation process associated with the oil and gas reserves.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the valuation methodology, including assumptions around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts including future oil and gas prices, estimated reserves, discount rates used, etc. by engaging valuation experts.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Company's specialists involved in the process and valuation specialists engaged by us.\n- \u00b7  Assessed whether the updated oil and gas reserve estimates were included in the Company's, accounting for amortisation/uni00A0/ depletion and disclosures of proved reserves and proved developed reserves in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7  Tested the assumption used in determining the decommissioning provisions. Also compared these assumptions with the previous year and enquired for reasons for any material variations.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the disclosure made by the Company in the financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the management's position through discussions with the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions obtained by the Company (where considered necessary) on both, the probability of success in the aforesaid cases, and the magnitude of any potential loss.\n- \u00b7  Discussed with the management on the development in these litigations during the year ended March 31, 2021.\n- \u00b7  Rolled out of enquiry letters to the Company's legal counsel and noted the responses received.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the responses received from Company's legal counsel by engaging our internal legal experts.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Company's legal counsel involved in the process and legal experts engaged by us.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7  Obtained representation letter from the management on the assessment of these matters.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nDue to complexity involved in these litigation matters, management's judgement regarding recognition and measurement of provisions for these legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over time as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.\n\nAccordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.\n\n## D. Fair Valuation of Investments\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, the Company has investments of ' 78,234 crore in the Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital Fiber Private Limited ('JDFPL') and Summit Digitel Infrastructure Private Limited ('SDIPL') (Formerly Reliance Jio Infratel Private Limited) which are measured at fair value as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.\n\nThese investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination of fair value is based on a high degree of judgement and input from data that is not directly observable in the market. Further, the fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern of future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fiber assets) and SDIPL (tower assets). Refer Note 2 and Note 37A in the financial statements.\n\nAccordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the management by involvement of internal specialist / external valuation experts.\n- \u00b7  We assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts including discount rates, expected growth rates and its effect on business and terminal growth rates used through involvement of the internal experts.\n- \u00b7  We also involved internal experts to assess the Company's valuation methodology and assumptions, applied in determining the fair value.\n- \u00b7  We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal expert and Company's internal / external specialists involved in the process.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the financial statements.\n\n## E. Impairment of Investment in shale gas entities and recognition of deferred tax assets\n\n- (a) Based on the assessment of the internal and external sources of information, management has identified indicators of impairment in respect of its investments in shale gas entities engaged in the business of exploration and production of oil and gas. In the current year, management has performed an impairment assessment by comparing the carrying value of these investments to their recoverable amount and accordingly recognised an impairment loss of ' 15,686 crore. For the purpose of the above impairment testing, realisable value has been determined by the management by considering estimates such as discount rates, reserves and volumes, future oil and gas natural prices etc, along with consideration of other macro-economic, business and financing factors including divestment agreement entered into for certain upstream assets.\n- (b) The Company has also recognised Deferred Tax Assets of ' 15,570 crore in respect of the difference between the book base and tax base of the investment in shale gas entities engaged in the business of exploration and production of oil and gas, in accordance with Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes. Recognition of the aforesaid deferred tax asset involves management judgement and estimates to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty to utilise the deferred tax assets against future capital gains.\n\nBoth the above items have been disclosed as exceptional items in the financial statements (Refer Note 31(c)).\n\nAccordingly, the above matters have been considered as a key audit matter.\n\n- (a) Our audit procedures to address impairment of investment included and were not limited to the following:\n- \u00b7  Obtained and assessed the impairment triggers identified by the management.\n- \u00b7  Read the note in relation to impairment of assets in consolidated financial statement of the shale gas entities.\n- \u00b7  Discussed the aforesaid matter with the component auditor in accordance with Standard of Auditing 600 - Using the work of Another Auditor.\n- \u00b7  Read the agreement in reference to divestment of interest in certain upstream assets operated by EQT Corporation to Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.\n- \u00b7  Obtained the realisable value assessment made by the management and assessed the methodology and the assumptions applied in determining the realisable value by engaging our internal valuation specialists.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the financial statements.\n- (b) Our audit procedures to address recognition of deferred tax asset included and were not limited to the following:\n- \u00b7  Assessed the basis of recognition of deferred tax assets in accordance with Ind AS.\n- \u00b7  Obtained and assessed the management assumptions / judgements and mathematical accuracy for calculating the difference between the book base and tax base.\n- \u00b7  Evaluated the management assessment on future transactions including capital gain projections used in assessing the recoverability.\n- \u00b7  Evaluated the management assessment of tax credit recognition including calculation of tax base as per the Income Tax Act, 1961 by engaging internal tax specialist. In making this assessment, we evaluated the competence and objectivity of our internal experts.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the financial statements.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW",

IT systems and controls over financial reporting\n\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting as a key audit matter for the Company because its financial accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Company's systems and data, cyber security has become more significant.\n\nAutomated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, which include IT governance, IT general controls over program development and changes, access to program and data and IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces between IT applications are required to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;\n\n- Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n- \u00b7  Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and internal audit and identified IT applications that are relevant to our audit.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the design and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of IT general controls over program development and changes, access to program and data and IT operations by engaging IT specialists.\n- \u00b7  Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity at the Company in respect of the overall security architecture and any key threats addressed by the Company in the current year.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the design and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of IT application controls in the key processes impacting financial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.\n- \u00b7  Assessed the operating effectiveness of controls relating to data transmission through the different IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging IT specialists.\n\nselection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nStandalone\n\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing as specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\n## For D T S & Associates LLP\n\n## For S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Reg.

The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nThe Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\n| CORPORATE   | GOVERNANCE  MANAGEMENT   | FINANCIAL   | NOTICE   |\n|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|----------|\n| OVERVIEW    | REVIEW                   | STATEMENTS  |          |\n|             |                          | Standalone  |          |\n\nFor short-term and low value leases, the Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## (d)  Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion and impairment losses, if any.

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## (e)  Research and Development Expenditure\n\nRevenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the project is expected to generate future economic benefits, it is probable that those future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the costs of the asset can be measured reliably, else it is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (f)  Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash at banks, short-term deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## (g)  Finance Costs\n\nBorrowing costs include exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.\n\nInterest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.\n\n## (h)  Inventories\n\nItems of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products which are valued at net realisable value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their respective present location and condition.\n\nCost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on weighted average basis.\n\n## (i) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets - Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets or group of Assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets.\n\nThe impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of recoverable amount.\n\n## (j) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Provision for Decommissioning Liability\n\nThe Company records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (k)  Contingent Liabilities\n\nDisclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed\n\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\n## (l) Employee Benefits Expense\n\n## Short-Term Employee Benefits\n\nThe undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.\n\n## Post-Employment Benefits Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Company recognises contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company pays gratuity to the employees who have completed five years of service with the Company at the time of resignation/ superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity fund has been approved by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nEmployee Separation Costs: The Company recognises the employee separation cost when the scheme is announced, and the Company is demonstrably committed to it.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nStandalone\n\n## (m) Tax Expenses\n\nThe tax expenses for the period comprises of current tax and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## i. Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the Income Tax authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance sheet date.\n\n## ii. Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of Deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## (n)  Share Based Payments\n\nEquity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equitysettled share based payments transactions are set out in Note 28.2.\n\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a",

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency closing rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange differences which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets which are capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\n\nIn case of an asset, expense or income where a non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## (p)  Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is generally the principal as it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nGenerally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods is made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Company has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped.\n\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations at the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct goods or services to a customer as specified in the contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government). Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction of performance obligations and a receivable is recognised when it becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of goods or services as the case may be. The Company provides volume rebates to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified and also accrues discounts to certain customers based on customary business practices which is derived on the basis of crude price volatility and various market demand - supply situations. Consideration are determined based on its most likely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum products contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on provisional price.\n\nDifference between final settlement price and provisional price is recognised subsequently. The Company does not adjust short-term advances received from the customer for the effects of significant financing component if it is expected at the contract inception that the promised good or service will be transferred to the customer within a period of one year.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).\n\nContract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest Income from a Financial Assets is recognised using effective interest rate method.\n\n## Dividend Income\n\nDividend Income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the amount has been established.\n\n## (q)  Financial Instruments\n\n- i. Financial Assets\n\n## A.  Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll Financial Assets are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of Financial Assets, which are not at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are recognised using trade date accounting.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\n- a) Financial Assets measured at\n\nAmortised Cost (AC) A Financial Asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n- b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)\n\nA Financial Asset is measured at FVTOCI\n\nif it is held within a business model whose\n\nobjective is achieved by both collecting\n\ncontractual cash flows and selling Financial\n\nAssets and the contractual terms of the\n\nFinancial Asset give rise on specified\n\ndates to cash flows that represents solely\n\npayments of principal and interest on the\n\nprincipal amount outstanding.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nStandalone\n\n- Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) A Financial Asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets are reclassified subsequent to their recognition, if the Company changes its business model for managing those financial assets. Changes in business model are made and applied prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of immediately next reporting period following the changes in business model in accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments.\n\n## c)\n\n## C. Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nThe Company has accounted for its investments in Subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost less impairment loss (if any). The investments in preference shares with the right of surplus assets which are in nature of equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category of investment and measured at FVTOCI.\n\n## D. Other Equity Investments\n\nAll other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Company has elected to present the value changes in 'Other Comprehensive Income'. However, dividend on such equity investments are recognised in Statement of Profit and loss when the Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## E. Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of Financial Assets other than those measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).\n\nExpected Credit Losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or\n- \u00b7 Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).\n\nFor Trade Receivables the Company applies 'simplified approach' which requires\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forwardlooking estimates are analysed.\n\nFor other assets, the Company uses 12 month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\n\n## ii. Financial Liabilities\n\n## A.  Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll Financial Liabilities are recognised at fair value and in case of borrowings, in the Statement of Profit and Loss\n\n- net of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised as finance cost.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\nFinancial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n\n## iii.    Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Company uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards & options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nDerivatives are carried as Financial Assets when the fair value is positive and as Financial Liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later to Statement of Profit and Loss when the\n\nhedged item affects profit or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or Non-Financial liability.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## A.  Cash Flow Hedge\n\nThe Company designates derivative contracts or non-derivative Financial Assets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the underlying transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## B. Fair Value Hedge\n\nThe Company designates derivative contracts or non-derivative Financial Assets/Liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer\n\nmeets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.\n\n## iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\n\n- The Company derecognises a Financial Asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the Financial Asset expire or it transfers the Financial Asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A Financial liability (or a part of a Financial liability) is derecognised from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## v. Offsetting\n\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the amount and it intends, either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (r) Non-current Assets held for Sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable.\n\nA sale is considered as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the date of classification.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of sale and are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.\n\n## (s)  Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\nThe Company has adopted Successful Efforts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. The policy of recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and evaluation other than\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nStandalone\n\nthose which are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under Development. All development costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under Development. Once a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets Under Development are classified as Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration and evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Company uses technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually.\n\nOil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Company's Financial Statements, according to the participating interest of the Company.\n\n## (t) Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at a later date.\n\n## C.   Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Company's Financial Statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in next financial years.\n\n## (A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe determination of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

The Company bases it's proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Company's oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the Financial Statements.\n\nDetails on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 34.1.\n\n## (B)  Decommissioning Liabilities\n\nThe liability for decommissioning costs is recognised when the Company has an obligation to perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions. These include; the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\n\n## (C)   Property Plant and Equipment/ Intangible Assets\n\nEstimates are involved in determining the cost attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking into account estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful life and residual values are based on the Company's historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological changes. The depreciation/amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes from previous estimates.\n\n## (D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nJudgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required. Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\n\n## (E) Provisions\n\nThe timing of recognition and quantification of the liability (including litigations) requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.\n\n## (F)   Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Company's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn case of non-financial assets company estimates asset's recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset's or Cash Generating Units (CGU's) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\n## (G)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and/uni00A0Liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (H) Fair Value Measurement\n\nFor estimates relating to fair value of financial instruments refer note 37 of financial statements.\n\n## (I) Global Health Pandemic on COVID-19\n\nThe outbreak of corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic globally and in India is causing significant disturbance and slowdown of economic activity. The Company's operations and revenue during the period were impacted due to COVID-19.

The Company continues to maintain that a Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. The Company has already referred the issue to arbitration and communicated the same to GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $/uni00A0165 million ( ' 1,206 crore) being the Company's share [total demand $ 247 million; ( ' 1,805 crore)] towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability.\n\nIn supersession of Ministry's Gazette Notification No. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10 th January, 2014, the GOI notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014, the GOI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the Gas Pool Account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer in Gas pool Account is ' 295 crore (net) as at 31 st March, 2021 is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets (Refer Note 4). Revenue has been recognised at the GOI notified prices in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1 st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under this arbitration and is pending adjudication.\n\nThe seventh procedural hearing was held in December 2020. Next date of hearing is awaited.\n\n## 34.4\n\n- (a) The Government of India (GOI) sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4 th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately USD 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24 th July, 2018 upheld Contractor's claims. GOI filed an Appeal on 15 th November, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Appeal is currently pending adjudication before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. The matter is listed for hearing on 20 th July,2021.\n- (b) An arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) against the Government of India (GOI) on 16 th December, 2010 under the PSCs for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts,\n\nwhich delivered its judgement on 16 th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 ('2018 FPA'). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI's challenges to 2018 Final Partial Award and upheld Claimants' challenge that Arbitration Tribunal had jurisdiction over the limited issue and remitted the issue back to the Arbitration Tribunal. Tribunal gave favourable award on 29 th January, 2021 ('EPOD Agreements Case Award'). Both the parties filed Clarification Applications before the Tribunal. On 9 April 2021, Tribunal issued its decision on the Clarification Applications of both the parties. It granted the minor correction requested by the Claimants and has rejected all of the GOI's clarification requests. GOI has challenged the EPOD Agreements Case Award before the English High Court. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limit (CRL) and the same is pending. The Cost Recovery Limit arbitration hearings  are scheduled during various hearing tranches in 2021. The Arbitration Tribunal is yet to schedule recomputation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which will take place after determination of the Claimants' request for an increase in the cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nGOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under Sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA. The Claimants contend that GOI's Execution Petition is not maintainable. GOI's Execution Petition is currently sub judice. Claimants have also filed Application for Recall/ Modification, challenging the Orders of Delhi High Court wherein Directors were directed to file Affidavits of Assets. The matter is listed on 13 th July, 2021 for hearing.\n\n- (c) NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by the Company before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for supply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. The matter is presently sub judice and the Company is of the view that NTPC's claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and the Company.\n\nConsidering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\n\n| CORPORATE   | MANAGEMENT   | FINANCIAL   | NOTICE   |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------|\n| OVERVIEW    | REVIEW       | STATEMENTS  |          |\n|             |              | Standalone  |          |\n\n## 34.5 Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources\n\nThe following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to activity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.\n\n| Particulars                         | As at   31st March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) As at  31st March, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Exploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost |                            |                                          |\n| Exploration Expenditure written off | 1                          | 4                                        |\n| Exploration Cost for the Year       | 1                          | 4                                        |\n\n|                                                                                                                          | 2020-21                                                                                                          | ( '  in crore) 2019-20                                                                                 |    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| 35.

Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member ('WTM') of SEBI in respect of the SCN.

The Company has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs.\n\nThe Company's commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\n\n## iii) Credit  Risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from company's activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration.\n\nThe Company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, advance payments and factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the Company to avoid concentration of risk. The Company restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.",

The Company maintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Company accesses global and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's cash flow position and ensures that the Company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\nThe Company's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n\n| ( ' Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | in crore)       | in crore)     | in crore)    | in crore)   | in crore)   | in crore)      | in crore)   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Particulars ^                                  | Below 3  Months | 3-6    Months | 6-12  Months | 1-3   Years | 3-5   Years | Above 5  Years | Total       |\n| Borrowings                                     |                 |               |              |             |             |                |             |\n| Non-Current *                                  | 3,048           | 4,606         | 20,447       | 65,641      | 61,593      | 34,004         | 1,89,339    |\n| Current  #$                                    | 30,638          | 2,663         | -            | -           | -           | -              | 33,301      |\n| Total                                          | 33,686          | 7,269         | 20,447       | 65,641      | 61,593      | 34,004         | 2,22,640    |\n| Lease Liabilities (Gross)                      | 88              | 88            | 175          | 587         | 552         | 4,853          | 6,343       |\n| Derivative Liabilities                         |                 |               |              |             |             |                |             |\n| Forwards                                       | 1,476           | 349           | 176          | 1,097       | -           | -              | 3,098       |\n| Options                                        | 178             | -             | 33           | -           | -           | -              | 211         |\n| Interest Rate Swaps                            | 10              | 1             | 22           | 45          | 76          | -              | 154         |\n| Total                                          | 1,664           | 350           | 231          | 1,142       | 76          | -              | 3,463       |\n\n- ^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) ' 86,999 crore.\n- * Include ' 793 crore as Prepaid Financial Charges.\n- # Include ' 149 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\n- $ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 3.4% to 8.6%.\n\n## ( ' in crore)\n\n| Particulars ^             | Below 3  Months   | 3-6    Months   | 6-12  Months   | 1-3   Years   | 3-5   Years   | Above 5  Years   | Total    |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------|\n| Borrowings                |                   |                 |                |               |               |                  |          |\n| Non-Current *             | 10,322            | 16,602          | 17,709         | 71,031        | 67,580        | 57,357           | 2,40,601 |\n| Current  #                | 47,497            | 3,094           | 9,823          | -             | -             | -                | 60,414   |\n| Total                     | 57,819            | 19,696          | 27,532         | 71,031        | 67,580        | 57,357           | 3,01,015 |\n| Lease Liabilities (Gross) | 87                | 87              | 165            | 592           | 552           | 5,129            | 6,612    |\n| Derivative Liabilities    |                   |                 |                |               |               |                  |          |\n| Forwards                  | 3,479             | 122             | 119            | 75            | -             | -                | 3,795    |\n| Options                   | 31                | -               | -              | -             | -             | -                | 31       |\n| Currency Swaps            | 320               | 240             | 415            | -             | -             | -                | 975      |\n| Interest Rate Swaps       | 3                 | 1               | 342            | 47            | 122           | -                | 515      |\n| Total                     | 3,833             | 363             | 876            | 122           | 122           | -                | 5,316    |\n\n- ^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) ' 71,048 crore.\n- * Include ' 1,901 crore as Prepaid Financial Charges.\n- # Include ' 515 crore of Commercial Paper Discount.\n\nStandalone\n\nNOTICE\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n## C.  Reclassification\n\nThe Company has reclassified certain non-derivative financial assets on 1 st day of July 2018 from Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) to Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) on account of its business model change.\n\nCost and Fair value of reclassified assets as on reporting date is ' 5,910 crore (Previous Year ' 10,301 crore) and ' 7, 3 8 3 crore (Previous Year ' 12,112 crore) respectively. Effective interest rate is 6.75% up to 30 th September, 2020 & 5.25% from 1 st October, 2020 per annum. Interest revenue recognised during the year ' 416 crore (Previous Year ' 814 crore).\n\nChange in fair value gain /(loss) of ' 29 crore (Previous Year ' 225 crore) that would have been recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss during the reporting period if the financial assets had not been reclassified.\n\nRefer Note 2 and 6.\n\n## D.  Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Company's business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method and Dollar offset method.\n\nThe hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- -Differences in the timing of the cash flows.\n- -Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).\n- -The counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.\n\nThe table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\n\n## Disclosure of effect of Hedge Accounting:\n\n- A.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## A. Capitalisation and useful life of property, plant and equipment\n\n- (a) During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Holding Company has incurred capital expenditure on various projects included in capital work in progress and intangible assets under development. Further, items of property, plant and equipment that are ready for its intended use as determined by the management have been capitalized in the current year. Judgment is involved to determine that the aforesaid capitalization meet the recognition requirement under Ind AS specifically in relation to determination of whether the criteria for intended use of the management has been met.\n\nFurther, in the current year, the Holding Company has reassessed the useful life of its plant and machinery in the refinery from 25-35 years to 50 years. Assessment of useful life of plant and machinery involves management judgment, technical assessment, consideration of historical experiences, anticipated technological changes, etc.\n\nAccordingly, the above has been determined as a key audit matter.\n\n(a)\n\n- Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n- \u00b7 Examined the management assessment of the assumptions considered in estimation of useful life.\n- \u00b7 Examined the useful economic lives with reference to the Company's historical experience and technical evaluation by third party specialist appointed by management.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Company's external specialists involved in the process.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the nature of the additions made to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets,  capital workin-progress and intangible asset under development on a test check basis to test whether they meet the recognition criteria as set out in para 16 to 22 of Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment, including intended use of management.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the impact recognized on account of the change in the useful life and disclosure made in the consolidated financial statements.\n\ndescribed in the 'Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by the management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n- (b) The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited ('RJIL'), a subsidiary of the Holding Company, have reported a key audit matter on amortisation/depreciation of spectrum costs and related tangible assets as it is a material item on the balance sheet of the subsidiary in value terms. Spectrum costs and the related tangible assets are amortised/depreciated to appropriately reflect the expected pattern of consumption of expected future economic benefits from continued use of the said assets. (Refer Note B.3 (c) and B.3 (e) of the consolidated financial statements). Determination of rate of amortisation/ depreciation in order to ensure compliance with the applicable Accounting Standards involve significant estimates and judgement and use of technology. Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.\n- (c) The auditors of Jio Platform Limited ('JPL'), a subsidiary of the Holding Company have reported capitalization under Intangible Assets under Development as key audit matter as significant judgement is involved in identification of expenses that are directly attributable and reasonably allocable to development of intangible assets and timing of capitalization. Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.\n- (b) In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors of RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditor, the following procedures have been performed by them: -\n- \u00b7 Testing controls over determination of expected economic benefits from the use of relevant assets and monitoring actual consumption thereof to true-up the expected pattern of consumption during an accounting period;\n- \u00b7 Involved internal telecom and information technology specialists to validate the expected pattern of consumption of  the economic benefits emanating from the use of the relevant assets and the IT environment over the relevant application systems used in monitoring of actual consumption thereof;\n- \u00b7 Substantive testing procedures including, verifying the mathematical accuracy of computation of amortisation/ depreciation charge for the year.\n- (c) In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of JPL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by them to address the key audit matter. As reported to us by the subsidiary auditor, the following procedures have been performed by them:\n- \u00b7 Obtained understanding and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over identification of such costs and criterion for capitalisation of such intangible asset in compliance with Ind AS 38.\n- \u00b7 For the samples selected, verified the appropriateness of expenses capitalised.\n- \u00b7 Tested the source documentation to determine whether the expenditure is of capital nature and has been appropriately approved and segregated into appropriate categories. Reviewed operating expenses to determine appropriateness of accounting and criterion for capitalisation determined by the management including monitoring thereof for timing of capitalization.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the reasonableness of management's assessment of the ability of intangible asset to generate future economic benefits with respect to expenses capitalised during the period.\n\nB. Estimation of oil reserves, decommissioning liabilities, depletion charges and impairment evaluation of development rights\n\nRefer to Note 32.2 on proved reserves and production on product and geographical basis, Note C(A) on estimation of Oil and Gas reserves, Note B.3(t) on Accounting for Oil and Gas activity, Note C(B) on Decommissioning Liabilities, Note C(C) on Property Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets and Note B.3(k) on Provisions and Note B.3(j) on impairment of non- financial assets and Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of the Holding Company's oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells and commodity prices all impacts the determination of the Holding Company's estimates of oil and natural gas reserves.\n\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Holding Company's oil and gas assets. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset's carrying values reported in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur work included and were not limited to the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Performed walk-through of the estimation process associated with the oil and gas reserves.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the valuation methodology, including assumptions around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts including future oil and gas prices, estimated reserves, discount rates used, etc. by engaging valuation experts.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Holding Company's specialists involved in the process and valuation specialists engaged by us.\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the updated oil and gas reserve estimates were included in the Holding Company's, accounting for amortization/depletion and disclosures of proved reserves and proved developed reserves in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Tested the assumption used in determining the decommissioning provisions. Also compared these assumptions with the previous year and enquired for reasons for any variations.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the disclosure made by the Holding Company in the financial statements.\n\nConsolidated NOTICE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nGOVERNANCE MANAGEMENT REVIEW\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW",

Sale of investment in Reliance BP Mobility Limited ('RBML')\n\nDuring the year, the Holding Company's equity stake in Reliance BP Mobility Limited ('RBML'), erstwhile wholly owned subsidiary, is reduced by 49% on account of sale of 44.91% equity stake in RBML to BP Exploration (Alpha) Limited ('BP'), a non-related party. Further, BP has acquired additional 4.09% in RBML by way of subscribing to equity shares of RBML at ' 1,155 crore.  Post the above transactions, the Holding Company continues to exercise control over RBML as it is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement and can affect those returns through its control.

IT systems and controls over financial reporting\n\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting as a key audit matter for the Holding Company because its financial accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Group's systems and data, cyber security has become more significant.\n\nAutomated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, which include IT governance, IT general controls over program development and changes, access to programs and data and IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces between IT applications are required to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.\n\n## J. Changes in presentation of segment information\n\nBased on internal reorganization, the chief operating decision maker revised its segment disclosure to combine the erstwhile Refining and Petrochemicals business segments into O2C segment. O2C segment comprises of entire oil-to-chemicals business of the Company consisting of refining, petrochemicals, fuel retail & aviation fuel (majority interest only) and bulk wholesale marketing businesses together with its assets and liabilities.\n\nSegment information is a significant disclosure and change in segment presentation could be potential to influencing the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Accordingly, the same is considered as a key audit matter. Refer Note 36 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and internal audit and identified IT applications that are relevant to our audit.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the design and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of IT general controls over program development and changes, access to programs and data and IT operations by engaging IT specialists.\n- \u00b7 Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity at the Holding Company in respect of the overall security architecture and any key threats addressed by the Company in the current year\n- \u00b7 Assessed the design and evaluation of the operating effectiveness of IT application controls in the key processes impacting financial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the operating effectiveness of controls relating to data transmission through the different IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging IT specialists.\n\nOur audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtained and read the notes approved by the Executive Committee (CODM) which records decisions made by the EC in review of business performance and allocation of resources to segments.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the discrete financial information for the O2C segment.\n- \u00b7 Assessed compliance with the disclosure requirements of Ind AS 108 including restatement of comparative segment information in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon'\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group including its associates and joint ventures  in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and  joint ventures  are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its associates and joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern,\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with\n\nreference to these Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors, as referred to in Other Matters paragraph below, the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nConsolidated\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these Consolidated Financial Statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to separate financial statement of 219 subsidiaries, 48 associates and 15 joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures incorporated in India.\n\n## For D T S & Associates LLP\n\n## For S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Reg.

Corporate Information\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise financial statements of 'Reliance Industries Limited' ('the Holding Company' or 'The Company') and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'the Group') for the year ended 31 st March, 2021.\n\nThe Holding Company is a listed entity incorporated in India.

Further details about the business operations of the Group are provided in Note 36 Segment Information.\n\n## B.  Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## B.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:\n\n- i. Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments),\n- ii. Defined Benefit Plan's - Plan Assets and\n- iii.

Control is assessed in accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ' ) and all values are rounded to the nearest crore ( ' 00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## B.2  Principles of Consolidation\n\n- (a) The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, incomes, expenses and cash flows, after fully eliminating intra-group balances and intragroup transactions.\n- (b) Profits or losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, such as Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, are eliminated in full.\n- (c) In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are consolidated at the average rate prevailing during the year. All assets and liabilities are converted at rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any exchange difference arising on consolidation is recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR).\n- (d) The audited/unaudited financial statements of foreign subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principle of its Country of Incorporation or Ind AS.\n- (e) The differences in accounting policies of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries/joint ventures/ associates are not material and there are no material transactions from 1 st January, 2021 to 31 st March, 2021 in respect of subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates having financial year ended 31 st December, 2020.\n- (f) The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n- (g) The carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary is offset (eliminated) against the parent's portion of equity in each subsidiary.\n- (h) The difference between the proceeds from disposal of investment in subsidiaries and the carrying amount of its assets less liabilities as on the date of disposal is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being the profit or loss on disposal of investment in subsidiary.\n- (i) Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has been accounted under the Equity Method as per Ind AS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Investments in joint operations are accounted using the Proportionate Consolidation Method as per Ind AS 111 Joint Arrangements.\n- (j) The Group accounts for its share of postacquisition changes in net assets of associates and joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.\n- (k) Non-Controlling Interest's share of profit/loss of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted against the income of the Group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n- (l) Non-Controlling Interest's share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## B.3   Summary of Significant Accounting/uni00A0Policies\n\n## (a)   Current and Non-Current Classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet based on Current/Non-Current\n\n- classification.\n\nAn asset is treated as Current when it is -\n\n- -Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\n- -Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- -Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- -Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as Non-Current.\n\nA liability is treated as Current when -\n\n- -It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;\n- -It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- -It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- -There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as Non-Current.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified as Non-Current Assets and Liabilities.\n\n## (b)  Business Combination\n\nBusiness Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, except for common control transactions which are accounted using the pooling of interest method that is accounted at carrying values.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on which control is acquired. Contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value and included as part of cost of acquisition. Transaction related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n\nFor each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\nGoodwill arising on business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses if any.\n\nCommon control business combination: Business combinations involving entities or businesses that are controlled by the group are accounted using the pooling of interest method.\n\n## (c)  Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the assets. In case of land the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment which are significant to the total cost of that item of Property, Plant and Equipment and having different useful life are accounted separately. Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\n\nDepreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment is provided using straight-line method except in case of certain assets from Oil to Chemical Segment which are depreciated using written down value method. Depreciation on wireless telecommunications equipment and components is determined based on the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits. Depreciation is provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the following assets, where useful life is different than those prescribed in Schedule II.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a Property, Plant and Equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (d)  Leases\n\nThe Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.\n\nThe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and has right to direct the use of the identified asset. The cost of the right-ofuse asset shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\nFor short-term and low value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n## (e)  Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion and impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost directly attributable for preparing the asset for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the Other Intangible Assets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nOther Indirect Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets under Development.\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an Other Intangible Asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\nThe Group's Other Intangible Assets include assets with finite and indefinite useful life. Assets with finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life and assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually at the cash generating unit level.\n\nA summary of the amortisation/depletion policies applied to the Group's Other Intangible Assets to the extent of depreciable amount is as follows.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\n| Particular         | Depreciation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | Technical Know-How Over the useful life of the underlying assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Computer Software  | Over a period of 5 to 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Development Rights | Depleted using the unit of production method.

Development costs are capitalised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the project is expected to generate future economic benefits, it is probable that those future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the costs of the asset can be measured reliably, else it is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (g)  Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## (h)  Finance Costs\n\nBorrowing costs include exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.\n\n## (i) Inventories\n\nIItems of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products which are valued at net realisable value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their respective present location and condition. Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on weighted average basis.\n\n## (j) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets. The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of recoverable amount.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## (k)  Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Provision for Decommissioning Liability\n\nThe Group records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfill decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (l) Contingent Liability\n\nDisclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\n## (m) Employee Benefits Expense\n\n## Short-Term Employee Benefits\n\nThe undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.\n\n## Post-Employment Benefits\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Group recognises contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date\n\nexceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or refund.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe Group pays gratuity to the employees who have completed five years of service at the time of resignation/superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity fund has been approved by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity and other postemployment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Employee Separation Costs\n\nThe Group recognises the employee separation cost when the scheme is announced and the Group is demonstrably committed to it.\n\n## (n)  Tax Expenses\n\nThe tax expenses for the period comprises of Current Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## i. Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance sheet date.\n\n## ii. Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred Tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the\n\ndeductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## (o)  Share Based Payments\n\nEquity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equitysettled share based payments transactions are set out in Note 26.2. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments Reserve. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## (p) Foreign  Currencies  Transactions and Translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency's closing rates of exchange at the reporting date.\n\nExchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange differences which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\n\nIn case of an asset, expense or income where a non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## (q)  Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group is generally the principal as it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nGenerally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods is made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Group has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped.\n\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations at the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration which the group expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct goods or services to a customer as specified in the contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government).\n\nConsideration is generally due upon satisfaction of performance obligations and a receivable is recognised when it becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of goods or services as the case may be.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

Consideration are determined based on its most likely amount.\n\nGenerally, sales of petroleum products contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on provisional price. Difference between final settlement price and provisional price is recognised subsequently.\n\nThe Group does not adjust short-term advances received from the customer for the effects of significant financing component if it is expected at the contract inception that the promised good or service will be transferred to the customer within a period of one year.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest Income from a financial asset is recognised using Effective Interest Rate Method.\n\n## Dividend Income\n\nDividend Income is recognised when the Group's right to receive the amount has been established.\n\n## (r) Financial Instruments\n\n## i. Financial Assets\n\n## A.  Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets, which are not at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchase and sale of financial assets are recognised using trade date accounting. .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nB.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\n## a) Financial assets measured at\n\nAmortised Cost (AC)\n\nA financial asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n- b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the\n\nprincipal amount outstanding.\n\n- c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets are reclassified subsequent to their recognition, if the Group changes its business model for managing those financial assets. Changes in business model are made and applied prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of immediately next reporting period following the changes in business model in accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments.\n\n## C. Other Equity Investments\n\nAll other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Group has elected to present the value changes in 'Other Comprehensive Income'.\n\nHowever, dividend on such equity investments is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D. Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial assets other than those measured at Fair Value\n\nThrough Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected Credit Losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or\n- \u00b7 Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).\n\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nFor other assets, the Group uses 12 month Expected Credit Loss to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime Expected Credit Loss is used.\n\n## ii. Financial Liabilities\n\n## A.  Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised at fair value and in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\nFinancial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n\n## iii. Derivative  Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards and options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\nto apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, when the hedged item affects profit or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## A.  Cash Flow Hedge\n\nThe Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative financial assets/liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is of Profit and Loss as finance cost, recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold/terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the underlying\n\nGOVERNANCE",

If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss..\n\n## B. Fair Value Hedge\n\nThe Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative financial assets/liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.\n\n## iv. Derecognition of Financial\n\n## Instruments\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognised from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## v. Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Balance Sheet when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amount and it intends, either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (s)  Non-Current Assets held for Sale\n\nNon-Current Assets are classified as Held for Sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the date of classification. Non-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. Assets and liabilities classified as Held for Sale are measured at the lower of\n\ntheir carrying amount and fair value less cost of sell and are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\nThe Group has adopted Successful Efforts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. The policy of recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and evaluation other than those which are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible Assets under Development. All development costs incurred in respect of Proved Reserves are also capitalised under Intangible Assets under Development. Once a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets under Development are classified as Other Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration and evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Group uses technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually. Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of Joint Operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the financial statements, according to the participating interest of the Group.\n\n## (u)  Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. Diluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at a later date.\n\n## C.   Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## (A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe determination of the Group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the determination of the Group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Group bases it's proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Group's oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the financial statements. Details on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 32.\n\n## (B)  Decommissioning Liabilities\n\nThe liability for decommissioning costs are recognised when the Group has an obligation to perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions. These include the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\n\n## (C)   Property Plant and Equipment/Other Intangible Assets\n\nEstimates are involved in determining the cost attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Property, Plant and Equipment/ Other Intangible Assets are depreciated/ amortised\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\nover their estimated useful life, after taking into account estimated residual value. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity period, based on the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits.\n\nManagement reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation/amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful life and residual values are based on the Group's historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological changes. The depreciation/ amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes from previous estimates.\n\n## (D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nJudgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required. Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\n\n## (E) Provisions\n\nThe timing of recognition and quantification of the liability requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.\n\n## (F)   Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn case of non-financial assets the Group estimates asset's recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset's or Cash Generating Units (CGU's) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nNOTICE",

During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group has determined that there is no impairment towards these assets.\n\n## (G) Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and/uni00A0Liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (H) Fair Value Measurement\n\nFor estimates relating to fair value of financial instruments refer note 35 of financial statements.\n\n## (I) Revenue\n\nThe application of Accounting Standard on Revenue Recognition for digital segment involves complexity and use of key judgements with respect to multiple elements deliverables, timing of revenue recognition, accounting of discounts, incentives, etc. The Management has reviewed such accounting treatment and is satisfied about its appropriateness in terms of the relevant Ind AS.\n\n## (J)   Global Health Pandemic on COVID-19 and Fall in Crude Price\n\nThe outbreak of corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic globally and in India is causing significant\n\ndisturbance and slowdown of economic activity. The Group's operations and revenue during the period were impacted due to COVID-19. The Group has taken into account the possible impact of COVID-19 in preparation of financial statements, including its assessment of recoverable value of its assets based on internal and external information upto the date of approval of these financial statements and current indicators of future economic conditions.\n\n## (K) Leases\n\nThe Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS/uni00A0116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses judgement in assessing whether a contract (or part of contract) include a lease, the lease term (including anticipated renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable lease payments whether are in-substance fixed. The judgement involves assessment of whether the asset included in the contract is a fully or partly identified asset based on the facts and circumstances, whether the contract include a lease and nonlease component and if so, separation thereof for the purpose of recognition and measurement, determination of lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period of lease and whether the lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease payments are fixed are variable or a combination of both.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\n## 1.

The Company continues to maintain that a Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. The Company has already referred the issue to arbitration and communicated the same to GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million ( ' 1,206 crore) being the Company's share [total demand $ 247 million; ( ' 1,805 crore)] towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability.\n\nIn supersession of Ministry's Gazette Notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10 th January, 2014, the GOI notified the New Domestic natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014, the GOI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer in Gas pool Account is ' 295 crore (net) as at 31 st March, 2021 is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets (Refer Note 5). Revenue has been recognised at the GOI notified prices in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1 st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under this arbitration and is pending adjudication.\n\nThe seventh procedural hearing was held in December 2020. Next date of hearing is awaited.\n\n## 32.4\n\n- (a) The Government of India (GOI) sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4 th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US$ 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24 th July, 2018 upheld Contractor's claims. GOI filed an Appeal on 15 th November, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Appeal is currently pending adjudication before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. The matter is listed for hearing on 20 th July, 2021.\n- (b) An arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and RIL (together the Claimants) against the Government of India (GOI) on 16 th December, 2010 under the PSCs for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial\n\naward ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgement on 16 th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 ('2018 FPA'). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI's challenges to 2018 Final Partial Award and upheld Claimants' challenge that Arbitration Tribunal had jurisdiction over the limited issue and remitted the issue back to the Arbitration Tribunal. Tribunal gave favourable award on 29 th January, 2021 ('EPOD Agreements Case Award'). Both the parties filed Clarification Applications before the Tribunal. On 9 th April 2021, Tribunal issued its decision on the Clarification Applications of both the parties. It granted the minor correction requested by the Claimants and has rejected all of the GOI's clarification requests. GOI has challenged the EPOD Agreements Case Award before the English High Court. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limit and the same is pending. The Cost Recovery Limit (CRL) arbitration hearings are scheduled during various hearing tranches in 2021. The Arbitration Tribunal is yet to schedule recomputation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which will take place after determination of the Claimants' request for an increase in the cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nGOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under Sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA. The Claimants contend that GOI's Execution Petition is not maintainable. GOI's Execution Petition is currently sub judice. Claimants have also filed Application for Recall / Modification, challenging the Orders of Delhi High Court wherein Directors were directed to file Affidavits of Assets. The matter is listed on 13 th July, 2021 for hearing.\n\n- (c) NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by the Company before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for supply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. The matter is presently sub judice and the Company is of the view that NTPC's claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and the Company.\n\nConsidering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration /litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand /disputes as remote.\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nConsolidated\n\n## 33.

December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice ('SCN' ) inter alia to the Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then a subsidiary of RIL. Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member ('WTM') of SEBI in respect of the SCN. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the 'Futures & Options' segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of ' 447.27 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal ('SAT') against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other noticees has been admitted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit ' 250 crore in the Investors' Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17, 2020 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. In the very same matter, on November 21, 2017, SEBI issued show cause notice, inter alia, to RIL, asking RIL to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held in terms of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 and penalty not be imposed under the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. The Adjudicating Officer of SEBI passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of ' 25 crore on RIL. RIL has paid the penalty under protest and has filed an appeal before the SAT against this order.\n- (IV) Plaintiffs in the relevant case had filed a Derivative action suit of ' 3,114 crore before the Bombay High Court alleging that all business opportunities undertaken by the certain companies of Network18 Group should be routed through e-Eighteen.com Limited.\n- (V) In the spectrum auction conducted by Department of Telecommunications, Government of India, in the month of March 2021,the Company has acquired the right to use spectrum in the 800/1800/2300 MHz bands for all the access service areas at a total cost of ' 57,123 crore. The said spectrum will be available for use in a staggered manner starting April 2021 for 20 years. Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited has opted for the deferred payment option and accordingly, paid an advance of ' 15,020 crore in March, 2021. Pending the allocation of the spectrum by the Government of India, entire amount outstanding of ' 42,103 crore as at March 31, 2021, has been disclosed under capital commitments.\n\nNOTICE",

Financial Risk Management\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework The Group uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its financial performance.\n\n## i) Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a) Foreign Currency Risk\n\nForeign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.\n\nThe following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.\n\n| ( '  in crore)              | ( '  in crore)         | ( '  in crore)         | ( '  in crore)         | ( '  in crore)         | ( '  in crore)         | ( '  in crore)         |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Particulars                 | As at 31st March, 2021 | As at 31st March, 2021 | As at 31st March, 2021 | As at 31st March, 2020 | As at 31st March, 2020 | As at 31st March, 2020 |\n|                             | USD                    | EUR                    | JPY                    | USD                    | EUR                    | JPY                    |\n| Borrowings                  | 98,493                 | 12,634                 | 12,962                 | 1,28,414               | 18,820                 | 10,717                 |\n| Trade and Other Payables    | 84,280                 | 2,584                  | 36                     | 81,528                 | 918                    | 45                     |\n| Trade and Other Receivables | (4,366)                | (110)                  | (13)                   | (12,151)               | (1,738)                | -                      |\n| Derivatives                 |                        |                        |                        |                        |                        |                        |\n| -  Forwards and Futures     | (55,167)               | (13,974)               | (12,936)               | (53,341)               | (16,571)               | (10,707)               |\n| -  Currency Swaps           | 2,655                  | -                      | -                      | (3,712)                | -                      | -                      |\n| -  Options                  | (19,347)               | (472)                  | 727                    | (3,620)                | (1,929)                | -                      |\n| Exposure                    | Exposure               | 1,06,548               | 662                    | 776 1,37,118           | (500)                  | 55                     |\n\n## b)  Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rate relates to the floating rate debt obligations and derivative products taken to mitigate interest rate risk.\n\nThe exposure of the Group's borrowings and derivatives to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:\n\n## ( ' in crore)\n\n| Interest Rate Exposure                                 | Interest Rate Exposure   | Interest Rate Exposure   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Particulars                                            | As at   31st March, 2021 | As at  31st March, 2020  |\n| Borrowings                                             |                          |                          |\n| Non-Current - Floating (Includes Current Maturities) * | 91,399                   | 1,33,952                 |\n| Non-Current - Fixed (Includes Current Maturities) *    | 1,01,143                 | 1,10,477                 |\n| Current  #                                             | 60,371                   | 94,765                   |\n| Total                                                  | 2,52,913                 | 3,39,194                 |\n| Derivatives                                            |                          |                          |\n| Foreign Currency Interest Rate Swaps                   | 33,279                   | 51,849                   |\n| Rupees Interest Rate Swaps                             | 19,450                   | 10,050                   |\n| Currency Swaps                                         | 2,655                    | 8,928                    |\n| Bond Future-Short                                      | -                        | 400                      |\n\n* Includes ' 812 crore (Previous Year ' 1,921  crore) as Prepaid Financial Charges. # Includes ' 290 crore (Previous Year ' 979 crore) as Commercial Paper Discount.\n\n## ii) Commodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The Group has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs.\n\nThe Group's commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using\n\nCORPORATE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nREVIEW\n\nConsolidated\n\nderivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\n\n## iii)   Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group's activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\n\nThe Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group Guarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group restricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\n## iv)   Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the Group's inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's cash flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\nThe Group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n\n| ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   | ( '  in crore) Maturity Profile as at 31st  March, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Particulars*                                              | Below 3  Months                                           | 3-6    Months                                             | 6-12  Months                                              | 1-3   Years                                               | 3-5   Years                                               | Above 5  Years                                            | Total                                                     |\n| Borrowings                                                |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |                                                           |\n| Non-Current #                                             | 3,083                                                     | 4,629                                                     | 20,489                                                    | 66,891                                                    | 62,782                                                    | 34,668                                                    | 1,92,542                                                  |\n| Current ^                                                 | 53,402                                                    | 2,938                                                     | 4,031                                                     | -

Reclassification\n\nThe Company has reclassified certain non-derivative financial assets on 1 st day of July 2018 from Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) to Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) on account of its business model change.\n\nCost and Fair value of reclassified assets as on reporting date is ' 5,910 crore (previous year ' 10,301 crore) and ' 7, 3 8 3 crore (previous year ' 12,112 crore) respectively. Effective interest rate is 6.75% up to 30 th September, 2020 & 5.25% from 1 st October, 2020 per annum. Interest revenue recognised during the year ' 416 crore (Previous year ' 814 crore).\n\nChange in fair value gain /(loss) of ' 29 crore (previous year ' 225 crore) that would have been recognised in profit or loss during the reporting period if the financial assets had not been reclassified.\n\nRefer Note 2 and 7.\n\n## D.  Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group's business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and Dollar offset method.\n\n## The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- -Differences in the timing of the cash flows.\n- -Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).\n- -The counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.\n\nThe table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\n\n## Disclosure of effect of Hedge Accounting:\n\n## A.
