        "page_content": "## Chairman's introduction\n\n## Nils Andersen reflects on a challenging year and the key actions taken to ensure Unilever remains resilient.\n\nCovid-19 cast a dark shadow over the whole of 2020 and on behalf of the Board let me start by saying that our thoughts go out to all those who have suffered from the effects of this terrible pandemic. Equally, we remain deeply thankful to all those front-line workers - including in our own business - who have worked tirelessly to help keep others safe and our economies moving forward. Despite the inevitable and widespread disruption to Unilever's own business, the Group responded with commendable resilience and ingenuity, delivering a good set of results in very challenging circumstances. Importantly, we also took the opportunity last year to progress our strategic change agenda with shareholders overwhelmingly supporting proposals to simplify Unilever's dual-headed legal structure.\n\n## Our performance\n\nGiven the need to manage the business dynamically in the wake of the far-reaching effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Group took the prudent decision early in the year to focus on volume-led competitive growth, and the delivery of underlying operating profit and free cash flow, as the best means of maximising value. The results confirm that those objectives were met, with an improvement in underlying operating profit when excluding currency impact, and strong free cash flow. Responding quickly and decisively to events - combined with a sharper focus on operational basics contributed significantly to the step-up in competitiveness, with over 60% of the business now winning market share.\n\n## Unification\n\nOn 29 November 2020, Unilever completed the Unification of its Group legal structure under a single parent company, Unilever PLC. For the first time in its history, Unilever PLC provides an equal voting basis per share for all shareholders and now trades with one market capitalisation, one class of shares and one global pool of liquidity, whilst also maintaining the Group's listings on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nThis was an important step for Unilever with shareholders of both parent companies, Unilever PLC and Unilever NV, voting over 99% in favour of Unification. We would like to thank our shareholders for their strong support for our proposals. There will be no changes to the operations, locations, activities or staffing levels in either the Netherlands or the United Kingdom as a result of Unification, but the changes will provide greater flexibility for strategic portfolio change and further strengthen governance. The headquarters of Unilever's Foods & Refreshment Division continues to be based in Rotterdam and the Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care Divisions continue to be headquartered in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nDuring the second half of 2020, we consulted on our proposed new Directors' Remuneration Policy which we propose to change at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 when our current policy comes to the end of its three year term.\n\nSubject to shareholder approval, the key change we are proposing to our Remuneration Policy is to replace the current Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) with a new Performance Share Plan (PSP) entirely delinked from the annual bonus. The new Policy defers half of the Executive Director's annual bonus in shares for three years while the PSP continues to require our Executive Directors to hold their long term share awards for a minimum of five years before they can be sold.\n\nBy enhancing the impact, traction and resilience of Unilever's incentives, the new Policy can help drive sustainable long-term growth and enable the Compensation Committee to set stretching but achievable performance targets over realistic timeframes. Further information on our proposals can be found in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 103.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nIn December 2020, Unilever announced an intention to put its climate transition action plan before shareholders and seek an advisory vote on the company's ambitious emissions reduction targets and the plans to achieve them. The plan will set out the company's climate strategy to reduce emissions, both within its own operations and through the value chain. It will also explain how the company is managing risks and meeting consumer needs and concerns connected with climate change. It is the first time a major global company has voluntarily committed to put its climate transition action plan before a shareholder vote and we hope this increased level of transparency and accountability will strengthen the dialogue with our shareholders and encourage other companies to follow suit.\n\nA continuing focus for the Board during the year was our engagement with Unilever's workforce. Virtual meetings were set up separately with employees, or alongside one of our virtual Board meetings. These engagement sessions enable the Non-Executive Directors to meet employees at all levels of the organisation to discuss how they feel about issues important to them through open discussion. The Covid-19 pandemic obviously dominated the way our employees worked in 2020, and our Non-Executive Directors engaged on a number of related topics, bringing their reflections back into our Board discussions. Further information on our engagement with Unilever's employees can be found on page 63. The Board also undertook a number of virtual visits to Unilever markets during the year, gaining valuable insights on these businesses and their contribution to Unilever's overall performance and strategy.",

Vittorio brought a high degree of knowledge and insight to us in over five years on our Board and chaired our Compensation Committee. I am pleased to confirm that Andrea Jung, already a member of the Compensation Committee, has taken over the role of Chair of that Committee.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nOur Board evaluation in 2019 was externally facilitated and the results were discussed at the January 2020 Board meeting. I decided that for the 2020 Board evaluation process we would conduct an internal exercise, the results of which were discussed at the November 2020 Board meeting. The Board continues to perform effectively with competent and engaged members, and in its evaluation discussions the Board agreed, in particular, to focus in 2021 on Unilever's:\n\n- \u25a0 growth strategy\n- \u25a0 digitisation\n- \u25a0 channel strategy\n- \u25a0 leadership talent and succession\n\nFurther detail on the evaluation process this year, together with the Board's remit, operations and the topics the Board regularly discusses and debates can be found in the Governance section on page 62.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nEven though trading conditions will remain tough and we will be living with the effects of Covid-19 for some time to come, the Group has already shown it has the ability to withstand shocks and to emerge stronger. With its powerful category and brand portfolio, enviable position in the growth markets of the future, and recognised leadership in sustainable business, Unilever has some enduring and unrivalled strengths. Combined with its strong leadership team and outstanding workforce, I am confident that the Group is well-placed to go on delivering competitive returns while meeting the needs of its multiple - and highly valued - stakeholders.\n\nFinally, on behalf of the Board, let me express our profound appreciation to the 149,000 hardworking women and men of Unilever - and the many more the company partners with - for their impressive efforts and commitment during a most difficult and challenging year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group responded with commendable resilience and ingenuity, delivering a good set of results in very challenging circumstances.\n\nNils Andersen Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's Q&A\n\n## Alan Jope answers questions on our performance, the impact of the pandemic and the Unilever Compass.\n\n## How has the Covid-19 pandemic impacted Unilever?\n\nThe first and most painful thing to say is that the pandemic has resulted in the loss of a number of Unilever colleagues across the world. Our thoughts go out to their families and friends, and indeed to all those whose lives have been impacted so tragically by this pernicious disease.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on Unilever's business has been significant. Widespread national lockdowns saw large parts of the portfolio - including our \u20ac1.7 billion food service business - hit by sudden and very dramatic falls in sales, in some cases by as much as 70%. The 'stay at home' message also led to declines across parts of our largest Division, Beauty & Personal Care, including in deodorants and hair care. In other areas, like home and hygiene and skin cleansing, there were surges in demand as consumers sought out products capable of helping in the fight against Covid-19. The in-home part of our Foods & Refreshment business also experienced an uplift in sales as people rediscovered the joys of home cooking. Across the year, we saw similarly unprecedented swings in consumer demand across geographical markets, as well as in the use of channels.\n\nResponding to these sudden and dramatic fluctuations in demand in the midst of a global pandemic has required a herculean effort on the part of our teams, and especially from our supply chain and field sales colleagues, who kept our products reaching the shelves while having to observe strict safety protocols. I want to record my appreciation - and my admiration - for all they did in 2020 to keep our business moving forward.\n\nWhile the effect of the pandemic on Unilever's business has been slightly lower overall growth than we would otherwise have expected, I do believe we can look back on 2020 with pride, given the extent to which we limited the impact.\n\n## Are there any trends - or changes in consumer behaviour - that you expect to endure once normality resumes?\n\nThere is much talk of a 'new normal' but in reality what I expect to see is more of an acceleration - and a cementing - of changes that were already underway. The move to online sales, for example, is only going to increase further as a result of the experience we have been through. That applies both to the so-called pure-play eCommerce providers but also, very importantly, where physical and digital channels combine (omnichannel), which is growing rapidly. The 61% increase in our own online sales last year is a powerful reflection of this trend .\n\nI also expect the heightened awareness around home and personal hygiene - and handwashing in particular - to be a lasting phenomenon. And while we are all desperate for lockdowns to end, our homes - and the pride we take in them - have become an even more central feature of our lives, and I believe that will continue. These are trends Unilever is well placed to help serve.\n\nOur own research and consumer surveys suggest there has been a marked increase in conscious consumption during the pandemic, with people increasingly reaching for brands they know and trust, ones they believe will contribute more broadly and purposefully to our lives and the issues we face, including environmental challenges like climate change and plastic pollution. I very much hope - and expect - to see this trend deepen further in the years ahead.\n\nWorking practices are also sure to change in the wake of the pandemic. Here I would expect to see an even more rapid escalation of trends already underway, and in particular a fastforwarding to more flexible, agile and people-centred approaches to work. However, even though the traditional 9 to 5, five days a week model looks increasingly outmoded, reports of the demise of office-based working are exaggerated in my view. A strong culture is the glue that binds any organisation together and that requires its fair share of physical interaction in order to learn, collaborate, swap ideas and stay attuned to the welfare and well-being of others.\n\n## As you look back, how do you reflect on Unilever's business performance in 2020?\n\nIt was a good performance overall, achieved in some of the most volatile and unpredictable conditions imaginable. The performance reaffirmed the strength of our brands and the resilience of our portfolio, as well as revealing a far higher ability to respond with speed and agility, something I called out last year as an area for improvement.\n\nIn any crisis it is important to move quickly to reset objectives in line with changing market realities. We refocused the business on competitive growth, and on delivering underlying operating profit and free cash flow. I am pleased to say that we delivered on all three. In terms of competitiveness, more than 50% of our business won value market share last year; and the most recent readings show that figure is now even higher at over 60%. There was an improvement in underlying operating profit when excluding currency impact, and we delivered record free cash flow of \u20ac7.7 billion in the most volatile conditions.\n\nOur underlying sales growth for the year was 1.9%, which represents a good performance in such volatile and precarious conditions. On the bottom line, underlying operating margin was down 60bps to 18.5%, although this was largely a factor of Covid-related costs and adverse product sales mix.\n\n## What were the highlights of 2020 for you?\n\nThe resolve, dedication and ingenuity of our people in the face of unprecedented challenges - combined with their willingness to pull together in a spirit of One Unilever - was undoubtedly a highlight of the year. It made me even prouder to lead the wonderful people of this great company. I can only thank them for what they have achieved over the last year for Unilever and for its many stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "Our performance in 2020 reaffirmed the strength of our brands and the resilience of our portfolio .\n\nAlan Jope Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThanks to their contribution, we have not only steered Unilever successfully through the first phase of a pandemic, but we have done so while simultaneously strengthening the company's portfolio and - with it - our ability to compete longer term. The successful completion of the Horlicks acquisition, for example, along with other acquisitions last year - including Liquid I.V. and SmartyPants Vitamins - further boost our presence in the fast-growing and strategically attractive segment of functional nutrition and wellbeing.\n\nAt the same time, we were able to give the company greater strategic flexibility to engage in even more transformative portfolio moves - should it ever wish - by successfully completing the Unification of the Group's legal structure under a single parent company, Unilever PLC. This complex undertaking has been a long-held and much debated ambition. To see it come to fruition on the strength of the overwhelming endorsement of shareholders was certainly a highlight of 2020.\n\n## How will the new Compass strategy strengthen Unilever?\n\nAt the heart of the Unilever Compass is a belief that sustainable and purposeful business drives superior long-term performance. That message is more relevant - and more resonant - today than ever before. While Covid-19 has concentrated minds and efforts on the immediate global health crisis, it has also reminded us of the fragility of the world we all share with other big global challenges, like climate change and inequality, becoming even more pressing.\n\nBy making solutions to these challenges the focus of our attention - and the essence of our brand propositions - we connect even more directly with the billions of people around the world we serve. They want to see companies and brands step-up and actively engage in addressing today's most urgent and deep-seated social and environmental challenges, not just pay them lip service.\n\nThe power and relevance of the Unilever Compass was captured vividly last year in the launch of some major initiatives. Clean Future, for example, commits us to replace all of the fossil fuel-derived carbon in our cleaning and laundry products with renewable or recycled carbon by 2030. And with Future Foods, we have set an ambition to transform the global food system, reduce food waste and accelerate the move to plant-based meat and dairy alternatives. These industry-leading initiatives respond directly to the wishes of consumers. They also build on earlier,\n\nequally ambitious, commitments around Climate and Nature and on reducing plastics, both of which are covered in more detail in other parts of this report (see pages 28 to 29).\n\nMore recently, we have given expression to the social dimension of the Unilever Compass by setting out how we plan to use our scale and influence to build a more equitable and inclusive society. This includes ensuring we pay a living wage to everyone in our value chain by 2030 and preparing our people for the future of work through skills and flexible employment options.\n\n## What are your priorities for 2021?\n\nDespite encouraging developments on treatments and vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. Our overriding priority remains, therefore, to protect lives and livelihoods. We will do that by focussing on the safety and well-being of our own people - and the many we work with in the value chain - while also continuing to play a prominent role in the wider relief effort, including in the roll-out of global handwashing campaigns.\n\nThe economic toll from the pandemic will be deep and longlasting. We need to be prepared. We will continue therefore in 2021 to focus on competitive growth. This will be a key part of our overall 4G approach of delivering consistent, profitable, competitive and responsible growth. All four are needed to create value.\n\nA further priority is to ensure we retain the speed and agility of response which characterised our performance in 2020. We have a wonderful portfolio of on-trend, purpose-led brands, many of which are directly helping people through the trials of the pandemic and prolonged periods of lockdown. Taking those brands to more places, more people and more quickly is a key part of our plans for 2021.\n\nFinally, in keeping with our vision and belief that responsible and sustainable business drives superior performance, we will continue to prioritise our multi-stakeholder business model, sure in the knowledge that the best way to deliver steady, compounded value creation for shareholders is to serve the needs and interests of all of Unilever's many stakeholders.",

Understanding their changing needs helps us to make informed strategic decisions.\n\n## Our multi-stakeholder model in action\n\nWe've identified six stakeholder groups critical to our future success: our people, consumers, customers, suppliers & business partners, planet & society, and shareholders. The stakeholder reviews on pages 14 to 33 explain how we've worked to create value for each of our stakeholders in 2020, as well as how our business benefits from these vital relationships.\n\nThe Governance of Unilever sets out the roles and responsibilities of the Board and, with the exception of specified Board responsibilities, delegates the running of Unilever to the CEO. The CFO also has certain powers in relation to financial matters set out within the Governance of Unilever. The CEO heads the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) which comprises the CFO, the Group Secretary and the most senior management of Unilever as set out on pages 66 to 67. The Board provides guidance and advice to the CEO and the ULE on multiple issues throughout the year. The table below highlights key Board considerations and outcomes and also where relevant the key considerations and outcomes of the ULE in line with their duties and the Board Rules outlined in the Governance of Unilever.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Section 172\n\nUnder Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 ('Section 172') directors must act in the way that they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of their company. In doing so, our Directors must have regard to stakeholders and the other matters set out in Section 172. Pages 14 and 15 comprise our Section 172 statement, which describes how the Directors have had regard to these matters when performing their duty. In light of our purpose to make sustainable living commonplace and the Unilever Compass strategy to drive superior performance as set out on pages 8 to 9, our Directors take steps to understand the needs and priorities of each stakeholder group and do so via a number of mediums, including by direct engagement or via their delegated committees and forums. The relevance of each stakeholder may change depending on the matter at hand. In line with the UK Companies Act 2006, below we provide a high-level summary of the concerns of our stakeholders and how our Directors and ULE engaged with them and had regard to their interests when setting Unilever's strategy and taking decisions concerning the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Stakeholder                                                                                                                                           | Interests and concerns   in 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | How we engaged in 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Board and ULE considerations  and outcomes in 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Our people We stepped up  our engagement  with employees  significantly to help  our people through  the pandemic.

We  also consulted with almost 1.8 million  consumers this year through regular  surveys using partners like Kantar, Nielsen  and Ipsos.

We were all affected by the pandemic in different ways. But even as lockdowns hit across the world, the tremendous efforts of people all around Unilever enabled us to continue to work quickly and safely, whether on the factory floor, on a tea estate or from a home office. We quickly tested and scaled up new ways of working - rethinking and reshaping our business for an uncertain future. And despite all the uncertainty, our people were more engaged, with engagement scores rising by 6% to 83% - well above industry benchmarks.\n\nAs well as the many ways in which we worked with speed and agility to respond to the unexpected this year, we continued to prepare our people for the future of work and nurture a culture in which our people can thrive.\n\n## Going above and beyond\n\nConsumers all around the world were relying on us to produce the household necessities they needed most, so it was essential that we kept our factories and distribution centres operating. We are grateful to the tens of thousands of people within the company who made this happen - and who did so with a safety-first mindset.\n\n## Working safely and at speed\n\nIn the midst of Covid-19, we concentrated on business continuity, making it safe for essential staff, such as factory workers and sales teams, to return to work. We did so with extremely strict protocols to protect everyone's physical and psychological safety, such as protective equipment, distancing regulations and frequent health checks, including on people's mental health.\n\nIn March, we closed all Unilever offices and some 67,000 people began to work from home. Overnight our communications became 100% digital. Even with remote working systems in place, this was not without its challenges. Each person needed the right equipment and systems to perform their roles, and we rolled out global guidelines on working from home. We saw no decrease in collaboration and productivity from March to June - in fact, this rose significantly, with 20% more time spent working together internally and 19% more time in virtual external meetings.\n\n## Becoming more agile\n\nThis year has highlighted our agility in many ways, most notably in our response to Covid-19. In just three months, we moved over 9,000 people from business areas that were slowing, such as our out-of-home food business, to teams experiencing high demand like those producing personal hygiene products. More than 20,000 of our people used Flex, our internal digital talent marketplace, to match their skills and capacity with business-critical demand in other areas\n\nof the organisation. As well as Flex, we're using an external marketplace to quickly access skilled labour from companies in sectors facing low demand, such as aviation and hospitality.\n\nWe're also increasingly embedding 'Agile' ways of working. Guided by our internal coaches and our new Agile Centre of Excellence, teams at all levels of our business are adopting new practices, including our ULE. These practices are helping us make better and faster decisions, innovate at pace and adjust quickly to changing consumer demand. A 10% jump in our October UniVoice scores on our speed of response indicates that we are making progress, although with this score still at 60%, there's much to be done. In response, we're simplifying everyday processes, prioritising and using technology to improve speed and efficiency.\n\n## Protecting wellbeing\n\nEven though our UniVoice survey in October showed a 9% increase (to 82%) in people who feel Unilever cares about their wellbeing, we know we need to do more to support our people to ensure their physical and mental wellbeing. We also know that people are working longer hours and coping with more distractions at home.\n\nThis year, more of our people used our employee assistance programmes, available to every single Unilever employee and in many instances their family, with a particular increase in family members engaging with our mental health support. Our online employee support also rose by a third in the year. We started gathering insights weekly through online and SMS health checks to help us quickly identify any areas of concern, such as domestic abuse or burnout. We responded to the rise in reported domestic abuse during lockdowns by giving people specific training in how to handle this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur people have been our absolute priority throughout 2020, and because of them we've been able to meet the needs of consumers and grow our business.\n\nLeena Nair Chief HR Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n93\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof our people are proud to work at Unilever (based on our 2020 UniVoice survey)\n\nWe also focused on giving people tools to cope with stress by strengthening our focus on wellbeing - working closely with local representatives to amplify and accelerate initiatives already in place. In 2020, this included building a companywide mindfulness movement by training people to deliver mindfulness sessions around the world, holding our first Global Mindfulness Day in October, and taking our leaders through an extensive mindfulness training programme. And in a wider focus on mental health across the business, we're building a network of mental health champions, with more than 1,600 in place by the end of 2020, including a group of mental health trainers.\n\n## Safety at work\n\nAs well as ensuring Covid-safe work environments during the global pandemic, this year we continued to focus on ensuring the safety of our people and contractors in everyday work situations - from the use of mechanical equipment to road safety. In 2020, our Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) improved to 0.63 accidents per million hours worked from 0.76 (1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020), in part due to a reduction in non-manufacturing accidents on Unilever sites due to the increase in homeworking.\n\nSadly, during this same period, two contractors and one employee lost their lives. A contractor died in a lightning strike at one of our tea estates in Tanzania; and a contractor in Romania was killed on a construction site at a newly acquired business. One of our factory employees in India died in a road accident stepping out of a shuttle bus on his way home. When fatalities occur, our policy is to have a global stand-down across our operations to pay our respects and reflect on the learnings. We've put in place several new measures around field safety during thunderstorms, safe travel on buses and construction safety.\n\n## Preparing for the future of work\n\nAgile methods are just one aspect of how we're working in new and better ways to become more fit for the future. Our extensive online learning programmes not only enable our people to upskill and reskill for their roles at Unilever, but are helping them prepare for the changing landscape of work.\n\n## A year of learning\n\nOne important way we're boosting our capability is by becoming a more digital business. We're hiring more people with digital backgrounds and investing heavily in developing key skills such as agile working and data analytics in all areas of our business. The Citizen Data Scientist programme we launched in 2019, for example, has qualified more than 6,000 people in our procurement, planning, logistics and manufacturing teams in digital skills.\n\nWe refocused our learning activities in 2020 to make sure our people have the skills to fulfil critical business functions, such as supplying essential goods and adjusting to shifts in consumer demand. We also prioritised helping people adjust to the fallout of Covid-19: promoting remote working skills, supporting our leadership, and helping people deal with issues around mental wellbeing and personal resilience, for example. The numbers of people accessing learning materials during the year soared. Users of our online learning platform Degreed were up 150% on the previous year, and our UniVoice survey showed that 82% of our office employees felt well prepared to do their job.\n\n## Focused on employability\n\nThis focus on learning is a key part of our ambition to make sure all of our people can reskill, upskill, work more flexibly and otherwise adapt to the changing world of work. We are determined to help everyone at Unilever stay employable. For example, we're pioneering new employment models, extending our 2019 UK flexible working pilot to ten more countries during the year. Offering the benefits of employment with more flexible contracts will help us attract and keep people with varying personal circumstances, both enhancing our talent pool and making us a more inclusive employer.\n\nWe're also continuing the work we began with the European Works Council in 2019 on a Framework for the Future of Work. With many factory and office workers in trade unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements we are working with the employee representatives to bring this framework to life. The comprehensive toolkit helps people proactively reskill for new ways of working, as we adapt our business to the efficiencies created by automation and in response to shifts in consumer demand. While we paused many of our supply chain change programmes this year in response to Covid-19, we have now restarted these - with minimising redundancies and helping people shift to new types of work central to our approach.",

        "page_content": "## Our people continued\n\nAs we continue to transform Unilever, our people will create future-fit plans to link their individual purpose with their career ambitions. Furthermore, we commit to reskill or upskill employees to ensure that by 2025 they have future-fit skills for roles inside Unilever or beyond. We recognise that job prospects today are limited for those without the right skills, particularly young people. That's why we've also committed to help equip 10 million young people with essential skills to prepare them for job opportunities by 2030.\n\n## Managing talent\n\nThis year, due to Covid-19, we made the hard decision from June onwards to pause all salary increases, promotions and external appointments until 2021- with the exception of a limited number of business-critical roles. This was primarily to protect both our people and our business at a volatile time. Due to the uncertain economic outlook, our voluntary turnover this year was lower at 5%.\n\nDespite our recruitment freeze in 2020, we continued to strengthen our employer brand through targeted digital communication to highlight the benefits of working for Unilever. The fact that we're the number one FMCG graduate employer of choice in 54 countries, and have the most followers in our industry on LinkedIn confirms the power of our purpose-led vision and culture.\n\n## Nurturing our culture\n\nMuch of our strength as a business lies in our shared values and culture. In 2020, leaders all around our business worked hard to set the right tone and support our people. Every two weeks, our CEO and ULE members held a global virtual townhall, where they answered questions from our people on issues such as our Covid-19 response, the rapidly changing external context, our strategy and our quarterly results to ensure common awareness of the factors affecting our performance. This openness was mirrored at local leaderled virtual townhall meetings, and this kind of transparency is making a difference to our people. Our October UniVoice survey showed the most ever pride in working at Unilever (93%), with trust in senior management up by 8% at 80%.\n\nWe work hard to help our people live their purpose and put our people first. More than 5,000 people were given virtual instructor-led leadership training in the year, 1,800 senior leaders were supported with training for leading in a crisis, and at least 50,000 pieces of leadership learning content were consumed through our online Leadership Gym.\n\nThis year, we also simplified our performance targets and began to move to a more flexible way of setting individual goals and checking performance during the year - another example of a more agile way of working.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Future of the office\n\nCovid-19 forced the transition to home working - for Unilever and businesses everywhere. Having 67,000 office-based people working from home this year has shown at scale that distributed and remote ways of working can work. With an eye on the longer-term effects of productivity, fatigue and culture, we're developing a flexible approach to working that allows our office-based people to do their best work from the most effective place wherever that is.\n\n## Working with integrity\n\nOur focus at Unilever is very much on growth in line with our values, not on growth at any cost. So we refreshed our Code of Business Principles this year to include the provision of a living wage to our employees, ethical data use, transparency and a greater focus on safety and mental wellbeing. Our data around Code breaches provides increasing insights into exactly what the issues are, and where - and we're focusing on understanding how to prevent behaviours that lead to breaches. We're training our people to prevent accidental compliance breaches, and our 24/7 Speak Up platform continues to be our main mechanism for reporting concerns around business integrity. Our ongoing commitment and zero tolerance to bribery is supported through our annual Countering Corruption mandatory training and initiatives on the ground delivered to all employees. We've been working to simplify and improve the whistleblowing process for users - this year, we received 1,357 reports, closed 1,434 reports (including some from prior years) and confirmed 723 reports as breaches, which led to 338 people leaving the business. See page 44 for how we manage business integrity risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our website for more on business integrity",

        "page_content": "## Open to all\n\nMaking Unilever a completely inclusive place to work will make us a stronger, better business. Our priority is to ensure that the diversity of our people reflects the societies in which we live and work. So we take a holistic approach - making sure people feel welcome and are treated fairly at Unilever, regardless of their race, gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, religion or experience and recognising the importance of self-identification, given the broad circumstances under which discrimination can happen. This year, the Black Lives Matter movement shone a light on racial discrimination and social injustice, and we strengthened our focus on race, alongside gender, disability and LGBTQI+. There are many facets to how we're pushing to become a more diverse organisation: leadership, training and awareness-raising, more refined employee data, recruitment and talent management, to name a few.\n\n## A beacon for diversity\n\nWe believe in a diverse yet cohesive approach to the complexity of true inclusion. While our vision and policies around diversity and inclusion are global, our local leaders create their own roadmaps for applying them. We badge our many business-wide inclusion programmes as #Unstereotype the workplace. In 2020, we started an inclusive leaders training programme. We aim to have more than 500 leaders complete the course by the middle of 2021. Each month, we report to the ULE on our progress towards inclusion, and our Global Diversity Board reviews progress three times a year. We have nearly 200 diversity and inclusion champions around the world who help us develop and deliver our programmes. This year, we strengthened our leadership focus on equity, diversity and inclusion, and established a racial and ethnic equity taskforce. This will help us deliver our racial and ethnic equity strategy, starting with the diversity of our leadership in countries with a history of racial discrimination, such as the US, UK, South Africa and Brazil.\n\nIn recent years, we've made good progress in our journey towards gender equality, hitting our gender balance target at management level one year early and maintaining it at 50% in 2020. This year, we launched a new coaching programme run online by specialist INSEAD coaches to help women leaders progress their careers. We now offer paid paternity leave in all of our workplaces.\n\nWe're committed to gender equality and fairness in the workplace, based on equal pay for equal work and achieving greater gender balance. Pay and overall reward is gender neutral, with any differences between employees in similar jobs reflecting performance and skill. Gender pay gaps can develop where there is a representational imbalance between genders. Our Framework for Fair Compensation has been instrumental in helping us review the average pay differences between genders at both a country level, and at each work level within each country. We continue to improve our gender balance, and relevant gender pay gaps, at various levels and in various countries throughout the business. While there is more to do on gender balance, our efforts are being recognised. We're proud to have won a prestigious Catalyst Award for our initiatives to create a gender-balanced and inclusive culture that breaks down stereotypes. We were also listed in Bloomberg's 2020 Gender-Equality Index.\n\nAs part of our Framework for Fair Compensation, we are committed to pay a living wage to all our direct employees. At the end of 2020, 100% of Unilever's direct employees globally were paid at or above a certified living wage level.\n\nIn 2018, we committed to improve the representation of people with disabilities in our business. This year, we asked our officebased employees to declare any disabilities. We plan to survey our factory-based employees in 2021 to get a more complete picture of disability across our business.\n\nWe want to make sure that people's experience of Unilever is fair for everyone and that we're fully including members of LGBTQI+ communities.

Almost overnight, people's immediate personal concerns health, hygiene and wellbeing - became a priority as people sought to protect themselves and their families from Covid-19. With countries going into lockdown and people increasingly staying at home, daily habits changed dramatically: from eating out to eating at home, from shopping in stores to shopping online, and from working in offices to working from home.\n\nAt the same time, consumers' desire for health and wellness products continued to grow as people sought to protect their health. During the year, we acquired SmartyPants Vitamins and Liquid I.V. to build out our portfolio of brands in functional nutrition, health and wellbeing.\n\nWhile the immediate focus for many was on dealing with the impact of Covid-19, concerns around waste, plastic and climate change were not diminished by the pandemic - if anything they became stronger. People continued to look for convenient and effective natural, eco-friendly and chemicalfree products.\n\nOur three Divisions worked to meet these changing consumer needs in a variety of ways in 2020: through product innovations, shifting to new distribution channels and connecting with consumers through their brands' purpose-focused activities - often going the extra mile to do this in trying conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPutting purpose at the heart of all our brands is not only the right thing to do, we know it drives superior performance and growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Beauty & Personal Care\n\n## We aim to be the most people- and planet-positive beauty business in the world.\n\nAs lockdowns affected the beauty industry more widely, they also changed consumers' personal care habits at home. In particular, we saw declines in the use of deodorants and hair care products. During much of the year, we focused on giving people the products they needed to stay well, particularly in terms of personal hygiene.\n\nWhen the pandemic started, we did not have a significant hand hygiene portfolio available in key regions like Europe and North-America to support consumers and meet their needs. We worked to build this as fast as we could. This meant expanding our hygiene offerings significantly through our big brands. Lifebuoy, one of the world's biggest soap brands, was introduced into 58 new markets. And during the year it became Unilever's latest billion-euro brand. Vaseline also expanded production of antibacterial hand creams to 18 markets.\n\nOur brands also responded to Covid-19 through product donations, innovations, and communications supporting people's hygiene and wellbeing. Lifebuoy, for example, donated more than 30 million bars of soap to refugees and other vulnerable people around the world, achieved over 60 billion impressions through their TikTok 'do the Lifebuoy' handwashing videos and launched a new campaign 'H is for handwashing' when teaching the alphabet to children. In hair care, Clear launched a 14-day programme to help boost people's resilience during lockdown, and antiperspirant brand Rexona launched a campaign to inspire millions of people in 35 countries to 'move more at home'. Dove, through its Courage is Beautiful campaign, and our Pepsodent and Signal oral care brands acknowledged the sacrifices of frontline workers such as health professionals.\n\nWith hair salons, spas and specialist stores temporarily closed, we shifted our focus to helping people look after themselves at home. Our All Things Hair website shared advice for how to create hairstyles at home, and Lux launched a lockdown campaign. With people shopping much more online, we shifted the focus of our Prestige Beauty brands towards eCommerce while Dermalogica introduced one-to-one virtual skin consultations.\n\n## People positive\n\nOur brands continue to drive for a more inclusive vision of beauty. Dove's campaign with partners for the CROWN Act (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) prohibiting discrimination based on hair texture and style, became law in seven US states and in September, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill at the federal level. Shea Moisture created a $1 million fund to support small businesses and entrepreneurs of colour. Through its Equitable",

        "page_content": "Skincare for All programme, Vaseline is working to improve skincare for Black and Latinx communities in the US by partnering with Medscape and Direct Relief to train medical professionals to better treat, diagnose and care for skin of colour. We also introduced a new brand, MEL\u00c9, in the US, co-created with dermatologists of colour for melanin-rich skin.\n\nIn South Africa, we have established an expert-led advisory board to help us develop programmes to support Black hairstylists and salon owners as one of a set of actions we are committed to including internal training on unconscious bias. During the year, we also announced our intention to build a more inclusive global skincare portfolio and committed to remove language such as 'fair/fairness', 'white/whitening' and 'light/lightening' from all our communications and packaging. As part of this move, we changed the name of our Fair & Lovely brand, sold across Asia, to Glow & Lovely which launched in September.\n\nOur brands have also continued to work towards improving the health and wellbeing of millions around the world - see page 31 to read how.\n\n## Planet positive\n\nWhile Covid-19 has focused attention this year on health and hygiene, issues like climate change and plastic are still extremely important - both to us and to consumers. We're continuing on our journey to use less, better or no plastic (see pages 58 to 59 for more). For instance, Dove has introduced 100% recycled plastic bottles in North America and Europe across all ranges. We're also making more of our brands available through refill stations, exploring through pilot projects how to make refilling our products easy and desirable. For example, we now have partnerships in Indonesia and Mexico, where Walmart customers can refill aluminium bottles with our Sedal shampoos.\n\nWe continue to advocate for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics working with partners and we welcomed China's decision to allow more cosmetics to be imported without a requirement for animal testing in 2021. We are now also asking for the EU to update its chemicals regulations to take a more progressive approach and allow the use of non-animal testing approaches to support the safety of chemicals. 23 of our beauty and personal care brands including Dove, Simple,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Lifebuoy acts fast\n\nTo help people protect against Covid-19, our biggest handwashing brand threw its weight behind new global advertising and social media campaigns encouraging better hygiene through handwashing. As well as producing 600 times more hand sanitiser in the year, Lifebuoy brought out eight new products, including masks, sanitisers and hand & surface spray, and expanded into 58 new markets.\n\n58\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuave and Sunsilk have certified approval from animalprotection organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). And this year our largest brand in Russia, Chistaya Linia, and our toothpaste brand Zendium, both received PETA approval.\n\n## Foods & Refreshment\n\n## We're on a mission to be a world-class force for good in food.\n\nOur ambition to give everyone access to good food and to improve the health of both people and planet took on new meaning this year, with the pandemic spotlighting the need for radical improvements to our food system. We saw many people cooking at home, stocking up and wanting to make food last longer, and looking to buy more for less as economies went through challenging times.\n\n## Healthy eating in\n\nIn response to people's growing concerns about health and immunity, we launched products with a focus on both taste and goodness: for example, Lipton Heart Health in the US, and Pukka's natural solutions and immunity tea selection box. Through our acquisition of GSK's Consumer Healthcare business in South Asia, we offered 150,000 packs of Horlicks with immunity-boosting zinc for free to Indian hospitals in major cities and expanded distribution of Horlicks and Boost ranges - products catering for child and toddler nutrition, women's wellbeing and adult wellness backed by strong research.\n\nWe adapted during the year to people's changing preferences and the shift from eating out - which significantly impacted our foodservice business Unilever Foods Solutions - to buying more food to cook and eat at home. Our supply chain worked quickly to keep stores stocked with cupboard staples, such as home cooking ingredients, soups and pasta, despite massive challenges due to lockdown restrictions and border closures. While people bought less ice cream to eat on the go, they bought more for their homes: sales of take-home Magnum and Ben & Jerry's jumped by 25%, for example. This was helped by the continued growth of Ice Cream Now, our fast delivery service through a host of online delivery companies, which is now available in close to 40 countries.",

It is our responsibility to make it easier for people to eat healthy, tasty and more sustainable foods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHanneke Faber\n\nPresident, Foods & Refreshment\n\n## More plant-based options\n\nIn all our Foods & Refreshment categories, we're offering more plant-based foods. The Vegetarian Butcher continues to reach more consumers, thanks to its expanding partnership with Burger King, most recently in China and Latin America, and a successful roll-out across stores in Europe. Despite the decline in people eating out, our professional foodservices division Unilever Food Solutions - launched Pushing Plants Forward, a global platform to help chefs meet rising demand for plantbased dishes. With our biggest brands like Knorr leading the way with its 50 Future Foods campaign, we're investing heavily in developing new plant-based protein sources and foods at our Hive Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands. This includes a new partnership with biotech start-up Algenuity to explore using nutrient-rich microalgae to enhance the protein and fibre of plant-based foods.\n\nOur plant-based innovations are increasingly being recognised. Nielsen named Hellmann's vegan mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry's non-dairy ice creams as two of its 2020 top 25 breakthrough innovations in Europe. Unilever was again named by investor network FAIRR as a pioneer in its benchmark of the best prepared companies for the shift towards plantbased proteins, coming top out of manufacturers and second overall. And The Vegetarian Butcher's Chickened Out Burger won a Vegan Food Award from animal rights organisation PETA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website for more on plant-based foods\n\n## Every brand a movement\n\nOur brands continued their work to inspire better eating and nutrition. Alongside the work of global names like Knorr and Hellmann's, local brands like Indonesia's Bango and South Africa's Robertsons have inspired home cooks by sharing recipes through food websites, as well as through specific campaigns. Continuing its fight against food waste, Hellmann's began a Stay-In(spired) campaign to help people make good use of cupboard staples and leftovers - sharing recipes as well as videos from customers across its social channels. This year, we committed to halving the food loss and waste in our global operations by 2025 as part of the Champions 12.3 initiative, a coalition of partners working together to reduce food waste.\n\nOur brands continue to take action on plastic - see pages 58 to 59 for more. Hellmann's became the first dressings brand in the US to switch to 100% recycled bottles and jars. And Bango, Indonesia's leading soy sauce, also moved to 100% recycled plastic. We're learning there are no easy solutions especially when it comes to the flexible packaging (sachets and pouches) for our Knorr products. This is a technical challenge made more difficult by the differences between individual markets on collection, sorting, recycling and regulation. We are committed to finding a solution and plan to accelerate our efforts in 2021.\n\nThe work of our brands reaches beyond food and nutrition to broader wellbeing, inclusion and sustainability causes. Brands like Ben & Jerry's continued to fight for radical change beyond food and nutrition, such as racial justice, refugee and voting rights, and climate action. Tea brands Brooke Bond, PG Tips and Lipton continued to campaign for more inclusion and human connections. And reflecting its commitment to sustainability and inclusion, our premium tea brand T2 became a certified B Corporation in February 2020.\n\n## A better system from farm to fork\n\nAround two billion people are overweight, while almost 690 million go to bed hungry - and a third of all food is lost or wasted. So we're using our size and reach to encourage the wider food chain to become healthier and more sustainable, faster. We're leading by example, with full nutrition labelling on almost all of our products to help people make healthier choices. And we're working behind the scenes with industry partners and others to make it easier for people all over the world to get nutritious and delicious food that doesn't damage the planet. For example, we worked with the World Economic Forum and other partners to convene a virtual two-day event to bring together business with academics, youth, civil society and government to discuss ways to accelerate action ahead of the UN Foods Systems Summit in 2021.\n\n- See our website for more on transforming the food system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\nFuture foods inspired by Knorr\n\nIn line with its purpose to inspire people to put new foods on their plates for a greener food future, Knorr aims to launch a number of new products based on Future 50 foods over the next two years. This year, the brand also shared plant-based recipes through its Cook with Knorr series and #CheatOnMeat campaign. Working with local chefs and foodservice partners, Knorr offered live-streamed cook-alongs for people cooking more at home during lockdowns.",

        "page_content": "## Home Care\n\n## Making people's homes a better world, and our world a better home.\n\nWith Covid-19 highlighting the importance of home for many, our purpose became even more relevant in 2020. As people stayed in to avoid infection and workplace hygiene became essential to employees returning, demand for our cleaning and disinfecting products jumped, and stayed high throughout 2020. Facing challenges like border restrictions and factory closures, we focused on making more of our most high-demand products using an expanded global network of manufacturing partners. We still have work to do, however, to get more of our hygiene products, such as disinfecting surface cleaners, to more people who need them. By rolling out our disinfecting products to new markets and developing new products under brands like Domestos and Lifebuoy, we're helping more people keep their homes clean and safe.\n\n## Towards a Clean Future\n\nWe know that consumers want sustainable products that perform just as well as conventional ones. So in September, we announced Clean Future, our ambitious blueprint for reinventing our cleaning and laundry products to give people affordable, high-performing products that are kinder to both them and the environment.\n\nWe're investing \u20ac1 billion over ten years in researching and developing new technologies to reduce the carbon footprint, plastic waste and water use, and increase the biodegradable and sustainable ingredients associated with our products. For example, we'll be replacing the crude oil and other fossil fuels used to make some of our chemicals with renewable and recycled carbon. We'll achieve all of this through partnerships and cutting-edge innovation - applying the latest science and biotechnology at scale to create cleaner, more sustainable products that clean, remove stains and disinfect at least as well as conventional products.\n\nClean Future is already alive in many of our products. Seventh Generation, our leading eco-friendly brand, enjoyed strong demand in 2020. Our biggest brand, Dirt is Good (Persil/Omo), is being relaunched across the world with a formula that contains plant-based stain removers and bottles made with recycled plastic. Our Sun machine dishwash range in France now contains 70% natural ingredients and is eco-labelled. Sunlight hand-dishwashing liquid in Vietnam and Chile contains a new renewable and biodegradable cleaning ingredient developed with Evonik Industries. Cif ecorefill, which saved 170 tonnes of plastic in the UK by encouraging people to reuse their spray bottles, is now available in other European countries. In India, some of our laundry powders contain soda ash made from carbon emissions captured from a nearby plant.\n\nConsumers not only want products that are more sustainable but also more convenient and simpler to use. Our laundry capsules continue to increase in popularity, with a strong acceleration of our capsules business in Europe. Easy to use formats, such as our Cif and Domestos cleaning sprays and wipes, were chosen by more consumers who were trying to cut down the time of more frequent cleaning and were rolled out in more markets.\n\nAs part of Clean Future, we're also working to make our sustainable products more affordable. Our ultra-concentrated dilutable laundry detergents in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay deliver the powerful clean our consumer expects, are packaged in small bottles made with recycled plastic and cost less than undiluted detergents. This year we also brought out a new range of affordable laundry capsules in China, a new brand of value cleaning products called Sahaja in Indonesia, and reintroduced Vim budget cleaners in Turkey.\n\n## Essential pandemic support\n\nWe acted quickly this year to meet heightened consumer needs for disinfection of surfaces, dishes and laundry, even in places where the supply chain was severely challenged. In China, we fast-tracked the launch of Domestos bleach, brought out a new range of surface disinfectant called Botanicals Hygiene and added hand dishwashing and surface cleaners to our existing Omo laundry range. In Italy, Lysoform rolled out a new medical hygiene range whilst Indonesia saw the launch of Wipol disinfectant spray. We also launched new antibacterial laundry detergents in Brazil, sanitising Comfort fabric conditioners in South East Asia, and Persil laundry sanitiser in the UK. Our disinfecting products are available in 55 countries.\n\nOur professional products range also helped the hospitality industry in over 40 markets ramp up cleaning standards to reassure customers. Our air purifying brand, Blueair, which enjoyed strong growth in 2020, launched HealthProtect, with proprietary Germshield technology which helps protect against viruses and bacteria 24/7. Blueair also donated air purifiers to schools, day care centres and children's hospitals.\n\nTo counter the initial confusion and misinformation around how people could best protect themselves from Covid-19, our brands supported public health messages around the world. Domestos, for example, worked with leading hygiene experts to inform people in how to safely and effectively use any bleach at home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an industry we must break our dependence on fossil fuels, including as a raw material in our products.\n\nPeter ter Kulve President, Home Care",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nWe're supporting our many customers, from global eCommerce marketplaces to small family-owned stores, as they adapt to people's rapidly changing ways of shopping.\n\nWe sell our products through approximately 25 million retail outlets, in over 190 countries. Our customers are diverse: from large traditional 'bricks and mortar' store partners (the largest group in terms of sales) to online-only retailers, small family-owned shops and value retailers. As the route to reach consumers, our customers are critical to our business success - and our primary aim is to help them grow sustainably alongside Unilever. With the impact of Covid-19 affecting retailers of all types in unexpected and often very challenging ways, we worked closely with our customers this year to navigate the challenges and opportunities of 2020.\n\n## Adjusting to the changing world of shopping\n\nPeople's behaviour changed everywhere in response to Covid-19, and this created a surge in demand in some product categories which suppliers did their best to keep pace with. As retailers of all types worked to keep stocks of household necessities such as hygiene and cleaning items, we supported them in a variety of ways. In March, Unilever offered cash flow relief to our smallest and most vulnerable customers and suppliers. We also acted quickly to bring in new protective protocols when visiting customers during the months of lockdown, so that we could continue to deliver products and keep shelves stocked. This sometimes meant finding new ways to get products to consumers. Unilever International, our market expansion arm which finds new categories, partnerships and channels, built new alliances with delivery firms like Uber as well as governments, institutions and NGOs to increase the availability of our hygiene projects. In Indonesia, we started a home delivery platform and fulfilled orders from eCommerce warehouses such as Shopee, Lazada,\n\neCommerce not only helps our brands reach more people, it also gives us the opportunity to bring their unique purpose to life.\n\nKeith Higgins Chief Customer Development Officer\n\nBlibli and even small family-run stores. And we helped customers keep up with surges in demand for essential items - for example, by launching Lifebuoy hand sanitisers in 58 new markets.\n\nWith the supply chain under pressure, to help customers get key products quickly into the hands of consumers, we also simplified our range to focus on top-selling brands. In accelerating so many trends, Covid-19 has presented a unique opportunity to strategically reposition our portfolio to become more future-fit - for example, by making space for more affordable products to meet people's needs in the recession. We're working closely with customers across multiple channels and value retailers Aldi and Lidl to deliver products designed and priced to meet shopper preferences.\n\nListening to our customers has never been more important. This year we joined the Advantage Group Survey who conducted a survey of our biggest customers across 28 markets. A consistent theme was that our customers increasingly recognise us for being strategically aligned with them, particularly around sustainability initiatives. However, we also hear that we need to improve our processes to ensure that more orders get delivered on time and in full to our customers, as well as offering more shopper insights to help drive category growth and sales. In response, we've launched a programme to improve our service levels.\n\n## e-everything\n\nDuring the lockdowns in 2020, a large part of people's lives moved online - learning, socialising and most certainly shopping. This increase in online shopping, referred to as eCommerce penetration, grew in the US in just eight weeks by more than it had over the last ten years. Our eCommerce sales grew 61% in 2020, representing 9% of total Unilever sales at the end of the year.\n\nAs shoppers increasingly use technology for their purchases and as certain categories such as health and beauty shift online, many of our customers are looking for the right mix of channels to serve their shoppers. As people's shopping habits changed, many of our large retail partners saw a dramatic fall in store shopper traffic in 2020. We supported their efforts to generate more online sales. For example, we're working closely with health and beauty customers, such as Superdrug and other AS Watson brands, to find the right channel mix and to bring shoppers safely back into stores. We're also designing products for online shopping and delivery - in 2020, we launched more than 600 new products across 18 markets that were designed for the Amazon shopping experience.",

        "page_content": "## Giving our customers an edge\n\nThe digitisation of shopping also brings new opportunities to understand shoppers' preferences and to help our customers meet them. We've renewed our focus on shopper insights to give our customers an edge, expanding the focus of our People Data Centres from helping our brands connect with consumers to helping our customers serve their shoppers better. We're sharing increasingly sophisticated insights with customers around shopper preferences and behaviours gained through social listening and other tools. This is helping our larger customers make data-driven decisions about how and where best to bring value to shoppers. We partnered with Walmart in the US, for example, to co-create and launch a new bath product range based on insights around people needing 'me time' at home during lockdown.\n\nWe also worked with our customer partners to find new sources of talent and innovation. We launched a new digital incubator with Alibaba in China that will bring together entrepreneurs, innovators and tech start-ups to create new Beauty & Personal Care brands for a flagship store hosted online. Not only should this lead to better and faster innovation, it will also create a pathway for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to develop exciting new brands.\n\n## Digitising our customer experience\n\nThe events of 2020 also fast-forwarded the shift towards digital ordering and fulfilment, particularly for smaller stores which, in many places, were badly affected by a lack of sales and delivery staff at the height of the pandemic. The online ordering from our small retailer servicing apps and web stores skyrocketed - from roughly 350,000 stores at the end of 2019 to an additional 115,000 stores ordering online each month in 2020. By the end of the year, more than 1.4 million stores had moved to our digital small retailer servicing solutions that help in checking inventory and promotions, ordering products and making payments for products purchased. For our customers of all sizes, this shift to digital frees up our sales distributors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\nMaking sustainability the easy choice with Amazon\n\nIn September, Amazon announced its new Climate Pledge Friendly filter which identifies more than 25,000 products across a range of categories that meet certain sustainability certifications. This helps online shoppers find products with a lower environmental footprint, such as our Cif, Dove and Seventh Generation brands.\n\nWe're also developing more products that qualify for Amazon's 'compact by design' certification - lighter items that use less water and packaging, so need less energy to deliver and to use.\n\nand representatives on the ground to do more valuable work like helping customers manage our product ranges and helping them serve their shoppers better.\n\nIn Brazil, for example, small retailers are scaling their businesses using our Compra Agora app. In Indonesia, we've partnered with eCommerce and delivery platform Gojek to launch GoToko, a digital marketplace platform offering comprehensive product ranges (including Unilever brands) at competitive prices. In India, we have expanded the footprint of our Shikhar eB2B platform for Unilever products to over 300,000 stores. And we've been partnering with Alibaba since 2016 on an eB2B platform for online ordering and payments that reached over 100,000 small family-owned stores this year. We're also continuing to work with financial providers like Mastercard to give smaller retailers access to credit in countries such as India and Kenya - see pages 30 to 31 for more on how we're creating economic opportunities throughout our retail value chain.\n\n## Selling with purpose\n\nAs consumers' desire for sustainable brands continues to build, so too does our work with customers to help them meet this need in a variety of ways. We're working with Amazon, for example, to help shoppers find sustainable brands such as Cif, Dove and Seventh Generation (see bottom left for more). In China, we developed a smart plastic recycling process with Alibaba, involving a pilot of AI-enabled deposit machines to improve efficiency. We launched an in-store refill trial with Asda in the UK, where customers can use touchless refill stations to buy and top up on home care and personal hygiene products, as well as teabags. And we kicked off the Recycled for the Planet initiative with Woolworths in Australia - an interactive shop that helps consumers to think and act more sustainably. For more on how we're keeping plastic out of the environment, see pages 29 and 58 to 59.\n\nWe also partner with our customers on programmes to benefit their communities. In the Philippines, for example, we joined forces with online retailer Lazada to support UNICEF in five countries to raise money for children's education programmes and partnered with Shopee to help small business owners affected by the pandemic. In the UK, our Pride 2020 range of products for Superdrug helped us raise money as part of a high-visibility Take Pride in You campaign in stores and online to support the LGBTQI+ community.",

We also work with a wide range of business partners, including industry peers, universities and joint ventures to help unlock growth and solve issues for the benefit of our stakeholders. Without our suppliers and partners we can't run our business. And it's through our direct suppliers, who provide us with goods and services such as raw materials, logistics, advertising, professional services and much more, that we can most influence change and help our business grow. We partner with around 56,000 suppliers to innovate our products and support mutual and sustainable growth.\n\n## An agile pandemic response\n\nThe events of 2020 highlighted the strength and agility of our supplier partnerships. By supporting each other during the pandemic, we were able to maintain business continuity in the face of workforce shortages, closed borders and unanticipated surges and drops in demand for product categories. In March, we offered cash flow relief to our smallest and most vulnerable customers and suppliers to help them cope with financial liabilities and maintain livelihoods. We protected employment by, for example, continuing to pay service suppliers - such as cleaners - for three months despite offices being closed. We helped to keep our suppliers functioning by providing them with PPE and creating a supplier webpage with information on hygiene protocols and guidelines for safe practices in light of Covid-19. And we worked side by side with our supply partners to respond to the worldwide need for medical supplies sourcing 250,000 Covid testing kits, 600 ventilators and millions of masks for places where they were most needed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCovid-19 has shown both the vulnerabilities and tremendous value of our suppliers and partners. We believe our strong partnerships pave the way to a green recovery and to a more resilient and agile supply chain.\n\nOur suppliers provided critical operational support as we responded to extraordinary surges in demand - increasing production volumes as much as 500 times for some personal hygiene products such as hand sanitiser. To meet the spike in demand, we adapted seven Unilever sites and added 54 new third-party manufacturing partners over four months - and worked with PaKLab, one of our existing third-party manufacturers, to develop and produce a new sanitising product for Suave. And we formed cross-industry collaborations to get essential goods to vulnerable areas at speed. For example, we provided 270,000 bottles of surface cleaner to hospitals and neighbourhoods in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, involving Heineken donating the alcohol, partners ALPLA, WestRock and Alemolde producing packaging, and third-party manufacturers producing the cleaner itself.\n\nWith borders shut due to lockdown in many of our markets, we also joined forces with suppliers to call on governments to open borders for essential goods such as food, hygiene and cleaning products. Our strong relationships with suppliers all over the world meant that we were able to quickly shift our procurement of essential materials in response to temporary sourcing issues in some countries.\n\nThe speed and agility of our supply chain does not come at the expense of safety or product quality. Our longestablished Safety & Environmental Assurance Centre (SEAC) works with teams across the business to ensure the safety and environmental sustainability of our products, and the processes used to manufacture them. We have responded to the challenge of Covid-19 by introducing more effective ways of working. We have introduced Quality Expertise 'support centres' to provide rapid responses to questions and launched a new digital quality platform to improve the way we collect and manage critical product safety data. And we also continue to closely monitor consumer feedback to ensure that we respond quickly to any emerging issues.\n\n## Partnering with purpose\n\nThe support of our direct suppliers, who are the gateway to the millions of people in our wider supply chain, is critical to our progress towards key aims such as reducing carbon emissions, stopping deforestation and improving diversity and inclusion. We can only achieve our ambitious goals by bringing our supply partners with us - in doing so, we believe we're positioning both our business and theirs for growth. Our relaunched Partner for Purpose programme aims to create an open, inclusive ecosystem of supply partners to deliver our innovation, growth and sustainability priorities. As we challenge our existing suppliers to make the necessary changes to step towards our goals, we also support them as they innovate for a better future.",

        "page_content": "## Protecting climate and nature\n\nWe announced new goals to achieve net zero carbon emissions from all our products, from sourcing to point of sale, by 2039 and to eliminate deforestation from our supply chain by 2023. Influencing our suppliers and supporting them to make positive changes is key to achieving these goals. After all, the vast majority are emissions from our supply chain or consumers using our products. This is why we're asking existing suppliers to adopt targets to cut emissions, and why we're prioritising partnerships with new suppliers who already have science-based emissions targets in place. We're also supporting suppliers through, for example, the new 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders initiative. See page 28 for more on how we're working with suppliers towards our climate and nature goals.\n\nSustainable sourcing is a cornerstone of our approach to drive sustainability throughout our supply chain, from the largest commodity suppliers to smallholder farmers. It involves raising the standard of agricultural practices to drive social, economic and environmental improvements, often through third-party certification. In 2010, we set a target to source all our raw materials sustainably - and in 2020, 67% of our agricultural raw materials were sustainably sourced compared to 14% in 2010. To maximise our impact, we focused on sustainably sourcing the 12 key crops and commodities - such as palm oil, paper and board, soy, sugar and tea - that make up around two-thirds of our agricultural raw materials. 92% of these key ingredients, including 99.6% of our palm oil, were sustainably sourced in 2020.\n\nOur innovation partners are helping us develop more planetfriendly products and ingredients. For example, we're working with Evonik on biodegradable cleaning ingredients and with SABIC to develop recycled plastic ice cream tubs for Magnum, rolling out 7 million across Europe in 2020. In our Home Care division, for example, we're starting to model the impact of different product ingredients on carbon emissions to understand how to reduce our footprint most quickly.\n\n- See our website for more on sustainable sourcing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Technology for transparency\n\nTo improve the visibility and traceability of our commodity supply chains, we're using satellite imagery, geolocation data, blockchain and AI. We're part of Global Forest Watch, a group of companies developing radar technology to detect deforestation more quickly and accurately. In 2020, we began working with US geospatial analytics specialist Orbital Insight to get data around the 'first mile' in our supply chains. Working with Google Cloud, we then refine this data to get accurate images of the forests, biodiversity and water cycles that intersect our supply chain.\n\n56,000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making our supply chain more diverse\n\nCreating a diverse supply chain, not only reduces risk but can also unlock innovation and agility within businesses. We're aiming to spend \u20ac2 billion annually by 2025 with suppliers that are majority-owned, managed and controlled by women, racial or ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ or people with disabilities. We want our supplier base to reflect the diversity of our consumers - and, with this in mind, are expanding our supplier diversity programmes in North America and South Africa into other regions around the world and building on their successes and learnings.\n\nOur well-established North American programme, for example, identifies opportunities to partner with underrepresented groups in businesses. Through initiatives like making sure every tender process includes at least one diverse supplier, our North American business has more than doubled its spend with diverse suppliers since 2017 and was shortlisted for a World Procurement Supplier Diversity & Inclusion award in 2020.\n\n- See our website for more on inclusion and diversity\n\n## Intelligent growth\n\nThe need to react quickly to the unexpected, particularly during the early stages of the pandemic, highlighted the increasing importance of technology for an agile and futurefit supplier ecosystem. As we worked alongside suppliers to respond to the surges and falls in demand across different product categories, the value of data insights, smarter sourcing and more real-time visibility of goods and logistics became very clear. This is a critical focus for us - we're using increasingly sophisticated digital tools to identify new potential innovation partners, bring new suppliers on board, audit suppliers virtually, and monitor logistics and supply risk in real time.",

By protecting nature and improving health and livelihoods, we will have a positive impact on the planet, on people and, ultimately, on our own business.\n\nTackling climate change and social inequality have long been at the heart of our sustainability agenda. But more of the same isn't going to bring emissions down in line with the Paris Agreement, or end poverty. That's why we've set ambitious new targets for improving the health of the planet and contributing to a fairer and more socially inclusive world, with aggressive timelines. And we're encouraging others - such as our suppliers and industry peers - to take bold steps, since only through working together can we make sustainable living commonplace.\n\n## Improving the health of the planet\n\nThe damaging effects of climate change and nature loss are becoming more obvious each year. As a large global company with a vision to be the leader in sustainable business, we have an opportunity to not just reduce our impact on the environment but to also have a more positive one. With this in mind, we set new targets to replace the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) goals which concluded in 2020. While we have made notable progress in areas we control, such as our own manufacturing, we didn't achieve as much as we hoped on some of the key environmental issues that involve our suppliers or consumers. For example, we fell short of our water target that involved reductions during consumer use. So we're building on what we've learnt and widening our influence. See page 34 for details of our performance.\n\n## Net zero emissions\n\nThere's no doubt that the world needs to decarbonise, and quickly. We intend to lead this transformation and this year announced a new target to achieve net zero emissions from sourcing to point of sale, by 2039. This means removing as much carbon from our operations and supply chain as we can, and only offsetting the remaining emissions as a last resort. In our own manufacturing operations, we've reduced CO 2 from energy per tonne of production by 75% compared to 2008 and are finding ways to replace fossil fuel energy with renewable energy - 2020 was our first full calendar year that we operated our factories with 100% renewable grid electricity. As a result, our Scope 2 emissions fell by 61% versus last year. And this year, 52% of our total energy use in manufacturing was generated from renewable resources. Across our operations, we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions from energy and refrigerant use by 60% since 2015, mainly due to our accelerated use of renewables and the phasing out of coal from our energy mix, which is now restricted to a small number of factories. We remain committed to fully eliminating coal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have a responsibility to help tackle the climate crisis: as a business, and through direct action by our brands.\n\nAlan Jope Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmissions from our operations are only a small part of our overall footprint. Progress against our target to halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the lifecycle has been slower than expected. Since 2010, our greenhouse impact per consumer use has reduced by 10% (against a restated baseline, see page 56 for more). We are making good progress particularly in Foods & Refreshment and Home Care where we have reduced per consumer greenhouse gas emissions since 2010 by 30% and 37% respectively. The per consumer use greenhouse impact of our Beauty & Personal Care Division has increased by 10% over the same period, driven primarily by the acquisition of brands with high greenhouse gas emissions associated with consumer hot water use, including hair and bath/shower products.\n\nWe're working beyond Unilever to get our suppliers on board as we work towards decarbonisation (see page 27). The size and scale of our 400+ brands - their production, use and influence - are some of our strongest levers in our fight against climate change. A focus on planet and people is at the core of each division's strategy - see pages 20 to 21 for more. Our brands will invest, partner and innovate through our new \u20ac1 billion Climate & Nature Fund over the next ten years to remove carbon emissions from the making and use of our products and from the environment. To support consumers who want to lead lower carbon lives, we have also committed to communicate the carbon footprint of every product we sell.\n\nIn September we also announced a transformational Clean Future programme for our cleaning and laundry products that will invest an additional \u20ac1 billion over the next ten years to remove all fossil-fuel derived carbon from products by moving to 100% renewable or recycled carbon. See page 23 for more.\n\nTo help the world move faster towards decarbonisation, we've joined the 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders initiative and endorsed a new SME Climate Hub launched in September. Through this platform, we'll work with other leading multinationals to help small and medium-sized organisations - both in our supply chain and beyond - put climate strategies into place to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nWe continue to report in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures - see pages 51 to 57 for more. In 2021, we will publish our climate transition action plan",

These build on the progress we've made towards our long-held commitment to send zero non-hazardous waste to landfill from our factories, which we maintained again in 2020. Hazardous waste from our factories increased by 23% due to the classification of personal protective equipment in many countries as hazardous, coupled with the closure of waste handling sites. We have made solid year-on-year progress towards our target to halve the waste associated with the disposal of our products - by the end of 2020 we had reduced this by 34%.\n\nThe pandemic has brought new challenges in tackling plastic pollution. It is imperative we, and the rest of industry, stay the course. In many cases our brands are stepping up their efforts. Dove has launched new 100% recycled plastic bottles in North America and Europe, Magnum introduced 7 million ice cream tubs made from food-grade recycled plastic, and laundry brand Seventh Generation now has a zero-plastic range.\n\nThis isn't a problem we can solve alone. We are working across our value chain on key issues such as packaging design, collection and new business models. In India, for example, we're working with the United Nations Development Programme to protect the livelihoods of informal waste collectors and to collect, segregate and recycle plastic packaging. Our CEO co-sponsors the Consumer Goods Forum Plastic Waste Coalition of Action. In March, we signed the European Plastics Pact to accelerate progress towards the reuse and repurposing of plastic. In June, we renewed our strategic partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and in October, we signed a manifesto supporting a UN treaty to eliminate plastic pollution from oceans by 2040. See pages 58 to 59 for more about our work on plastic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website for more on plastic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Brands taking a stand on climate\n\nOur brands are working in a variety of ways to help us move towards our climate commitments. Laundry brand Seventh Generation is investing in initiatives to reduce its carbon emissions. Foods & Refreshment brands like Knorr and more recent acquisitions like The Vegetarian Butcher are working to lower emissions by inspiring more plant-based eating. And Love Beauty and Planet is giving $40 (per tonne of carbon) to a carbon tax fund supporting programmes reducing carbon emissions and landfill waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u20ac1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate & Nature Fund announced in June 2020\n\n## Protecting and regenerating nature\n\nWith an agricultural footprint of more than 3 million hectares, we have a responsibility to preserve land for future generations. We're aiming to achieve this through sustainable sourcing of our key commodities, regenerative agriculture practices and a deforestation-free supply chain, enabled by greater transparency.\n\nWe've been at the forefront of efforts to tackle commodity-driven deforestation over the last decade. This year, we announced our aim to reach a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023, following on from the original Consumer Goods Forum industry target of zero net deforestation by 2020. To achieve this, we're focusing our efforts on crops with a high risk: palm oil, soy, paper and board, tea and cocoa. We introduced a new sourcing policy for these materials that clearly lays out our requirements and expectations of our suppliers. We are making progress, particularly with palm oil and soy suppliers. Working with fewer palm oil mills, for example, allows us to better manage traceability and risk. So we're refining our palm oil mill network from 1,600 to 500 mills by 2023. See page 27 for how we're using technology to improve the transparency of our supply chain.\n\nWhile sustainable sourcing and ensuring a deforestation-free supply chain is critical, lasting improvements to the soil and ecosystems we depend on simply won't happen without more regenerative agricultural practices. To this end, we plan to launch new Regenerative Agriculture Principles in 2021. We'll use these to set up best practice pilot projects with suppliers to support improvements in soil health, biodiversity, water quality and climate resilience.\n\nConsumers want confidence that the products they're buying come from suppliers with high environmental and social standards - and being transparent about our supply chain is key to this. We publish lists of our direct suppliers for soy, tea, paper and board - as well as both direct and indirect suppliers for palm (refineries, crushing facilities and mills) and cocoa (cooperatives). We also report publicly on the issues we face with palm oil suppliers so that others can see and act on these insights. This year we suspended 158 palm oil suppliers due to grievances for non-compliance against our palm oil sourcing policy.\n\nBringing smallholders and farmers on this journey with us is crucial - not just to protect the land and water and ensure the quality of our products, but also to improve social equity and the livelihoods of millions. Since 2011, across all our smallholder programmes, we've helped over 832,000 smallholder farmers access initiatives aiming to improve their agricultural practices. And we're extending our support to help smallholders to diversify their incomes and tackle climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's become even more critical this year, with the importance of good hygiene in protecting against Covid-19. And water scarcity and climate change are, of course, inextricably linked. While we fell some way short of our 2020 targets for water connected to the consumer use of our products, we made good progress in reducing the water used in manufacturing, cutting this by 49% since 2008 and hitting our 2020 target two years early. We're continuing to produce and promote products that use less water. And to protect aquatic ecosystems, we're developing more biodegradable products and are aiming to make our product formulations biodegradable by 2030.\n\nWe also work to promote good water management, particularly in water-stressed areas. This year, we announced that we'll aim to establish water stewardship programmes around 100 sites in water stressed areas by 2030 and have joined the Alliance for Water Stewardship. We'll build on our success in managing water in our factories to embed good community water management practices in water-stressed countries using what we've learned from our Prabhat water stewardship programme in India, which since 2013 has conserved over 50 billion litres of water so far. And, as part of the 2030 Water Resources Group hosted by the World Bank, we're also working with governments and other stakeholders to improve water resilience across India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam and Bangladesh.\n\n- See our website for more on water stewardship\n\n## A fairer and more inclusive world\n\nOur business relies on the millions of people who work in our value chain - including farmers, factory workers, small shop owners, waste recyclers and others. We can only create widescale change by giving people opportunities to improve their livelihoods. So we work to improve people's health, confidence and wellbeing; to create opportunities for all; and to respect and promote human rights.\n\nThis year was hard for many in our value chain, but it reinforced the importance of collaborating with others. We continued to work to eradicate forced labour, particularly in the palm oil industry, including through the Consumer Goods Forum - and to push for fair opportunities and access to rights for all through the Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition.\n\n## Promoting human rights\n\nRespecting and promoting human rights is a non-negotiable part of working with Unilever. Safe working conditions became even more critical in 2020, particularly for frontline factory workers in our own operations and extended supply chain who were critical in meeting changes in demand due to Covid-19.\n\nWe're continuing to roll out our Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP), which sets standards on human and labour rights, to all Unilever suppliers - in 2020, 83% of our procurement spend was through suppliers meeting these requirements. While this falls short of our 2020 target, partly due to slower progress during the pandemic,\n\nwe remain committed to increasing supplier compliance. We plan to relaunch our RSP in 2021 with an expanded focus on climate and nature. We're also rolling this out to our suppliers beyond tier 1 (those that directly invoice us), preparing them for our future requirements and encouraging the embedding of rights into more flexible employment models such as the gig economy.\n\nWe work with third parties to remediate and improve any poor practices identified through screening or auditing. During 2020, we launched a virtual auditing programme to continue monitoring human rights in our extended supply chain. Those who are unwilling or unable to comply with the RSP - or the Responsible Business Partner Policy which applies to partners who are not suppliers - are subject to delisting.\n\nWhile there's still much to be done, we are moving in the right direction - as shown by our joint first ranking in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark and first ranking in agricultural products industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website for more on human rights\n\n## Raising living standards\n\nPaying all workers fairly for the work they do is a fundamental human right. In January 2021, we announced a goal that everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever will earn at least a living wage or a living income by 2030. We will specifically focus on the most vulnerable workers in manufacturing and agriculture, working with stakeholders to raise living standards through supplier selection practices, collaboration and advocacy wherever we operate.\n\nWe have been working to improve the incomes of small-scale retailers in our distribution network for a number of years. While we missed our original target to reach 5 million small retailers, in 2021 we set a new goal building on the lessons we learned to help 5 million small and medium-sized enterprises in our retail value chain grow their business through access to finance, technology and digital skills by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website for more on raising living standards\n\n## Opportunities for all\n\nTo be a truly inclusive business, we need to make sure women, especially women from under-represented groups, have the same access as men to opportunities. We continue to invest in women's livelihoods to benefit families and communities, and to grow our business.\n\nA number of our brands, including Sunsilk, TRESemm\u00e9, Radiant and Glow & Lovely have developed their brand purpose around skills and confidence-building, particularly focused on women. Glow & Lovely continued to offer scholarships, education and training to Indian women. And our Sunlight dishwashing brand continued its work in Indonesia with UN Women, through the WeLearn online learning platform for women entrepreneurs. Through their efforts, we've enabled over 2.6 million women to access initiatives aiming to develop their skills - short of our 5 million goal.",

In the US, our brands rallied around a Unilever-led United For America campaign to help the hardest-hit US communities in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This included a United For America X Luminary Fellowship Program, rolled out across several cities, to help women-owned businesses adapt and keep people employed. 80% of the fellowships will go to businesses owned by women of colour.

That's why we have committed to increase the number of advertisements that feature diverse groups of people.\n\n- See our website for more on inclusion and diversity\n\n## Better health and hygiene\n\nSince 2010, Lifebuoy and Domestos have worked extensively to improve hygiene and sanitation for millions of people around the world. Lifebuoy has reached over 1 billion people with its handwashing campaigns - and Domestos, working with UNICEF, has helped more than 29 million people access better sanitation and hygiene (2012 to 2020). This year, we also committed \u20ac100 million for donations of soap, sanitiser, bleach and food to help those affected by the pandemic. With the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, we launched a global handwashing campaign aimed at reaching one billion people, including the donation of over 20 million hygiene products for those with poor sanitation or health systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website for more on health and wellbeing\n\n## Healthier eating\n\nThrough our biggest food brands like Knorr and Hellmann's, we continued to promote healthy and affordable diets. We achieved our ambition of doubling the proportion of products meeting the Highest Nutritional Standards (based on globally recognised dietary recommendations), now at 61% of our Foods portfolio. We also continued to reduce the sugar and salt in our products. To continue to raise our ambition levels, a new commitment was agreed to double the number of products sold with micronutrients as well as nutritious ingredients like vegetables, fruit and beans. And we're adding more plant-based products across our Foods portfolio - we aim to achieve annual sales of \u20ac1 billion in plant-based meat and dairy alternatives over the next five to seven years. See page 22 for more.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Compass strategy puts sustainability at the heart of our business. We're setting out to prove that sustainability not only benefits people and planet, but that it also drives superior business performance.\n\nRebecca Marmot\n\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nFortifying our most popular and affordable products is another key area of focus. In 2020, we hit the milestone of providing 100 billion servings of food containing the key micronutrients iron, iodine, zinc and vitamins A and D - halfway to our goal of 200 billion by 2022. Our 2020 acquisition of GSK's Consumer Healthcare business in South Asia gives us important new products aimed at improving child nutrition and women's wellbeing, such as the Horlicks range. In recognition of our commitment to nutrition, Hindustan Unilever Limited was ranked joint first in the Access to Nutrition India Spotlight Index 2020.\n\nOur Foods & Refreshment brands continued to encourage nutritious choices through clear labelling, balanced portions and nutritious cooking campaigns, which also supported the many people cooking more at home during the pandemic - see page 21 for more.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website for more on improving nutrition\n\n| Sustainability rating                                         | Performance in 2020                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index                            | Score: 90/100 - Industry Leader                           |\n| Sector: Personal Products                                     | 'Gold Status'                                             |\n| CDP                                                           | Climate score: A (A List)                                 |\n| Sector: All sectors                                           | Water score: A (A List)  Palm oil score: A- Soy score: A- |\n| GlobeScan Sustainability   Leaders Survey Sector: All sectors | Timber score: A- Ranked 1st overall                       |\n| S&P Global Ratings  Sector: Consumer Products                 | ESG score: 89/100                                         |\n| Sustainalytics  Sector: Personal Products                     | ESG risk rating: Medium  ESG management score: Strong     |",

Our immediate response to the impact of Covid-19 was to focus on protecting our people, safeguarding supply, responding to new patterns of demand, supporting our communities, and preserving our cash and balance sheet strength.\n\nWe demonstrated the resilience of our business in 2020 and unlocked new levels of agility in responding to unprecedented fluctuations in consumer demand and channel dynamics. Our focus on operational excellence and the fundamentals of growth delivered an improvement in competitiveness. And we continued to strengthen our business by unifying our dual-headed legal structure, which will give us more strategic flexibility for portfolio evolution, remove complexity and further strengthen our corporate governance.\n\n## Our performance in 2020\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, we decided the best way to manage our business was to refocus on competitive growth and delivering underlying operating profit and free cash flow. We've performed well against these objectives - with more than 60% of our business winning market share in the last quarter in the markets that we measure.\n\nOur 2020 profitability was healthy, despite the additional Covid-19 costs. Underlying operating profit of \u20ac9.4 billion declined by 5.8% but rose by 0.7% at constant exchange rates. Underlying operating margin fell by 60bps driven by gross margin which declined by 50bps. This includes a negative impact of 90bps from Covid-19, reflecting additional costs in adapting our supply chain and adverse mix.\n\nMeanwhile, our focus on protecting cash and keeping our operations running efficiently led to \u20ac7.7 billion of free cash flow. This increase of \u20ac1.5 billion was driven by favourable movements in working capital, as we increased our focus on payments from our customers (receivables) and rephased our capital expenditure in light of Covid-19.\n\nWe grew underlying sales by 1.9% in 2020, with volumes growing 1.6% and 0.3% from price. Category and demand patterns varied throughout the year and by market, driven by the differing status of lock-down restrictions.\n\n1.9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur turnover decreased by 2.4%, primarily driven by a negative currency impact of 5.4%, with a positive impact of 1.2% from acquisitions net of disposals. Our eCommerce sales grew by 61% as we captured demand in online channels - and is now 9% of Unilever's sales. See pages 36 to 37 for more on Divisional, category and market performance.\n\n## Our strategic choices for future success\n\nIn early 2021, we set out in detail the Unilever Compass strategy to deliver our vision. It guides our decisions and actions in five key areas: portfolio, brands, markets, channels and culture. All of this is underpinned by our focus on creating value through our multi-year financial framework.\n\n## 1. Developing our portfolio into high growth spaces\n\nWe hold clear global leadership positions in six categories; and in a seventh, we lead in terms of volume sold but not yet value. More than 50% of our global turnover comes from our 13 biggest brands, each generating more than \u20ac1 billion of sales in 2020.\n\nWe're building on this by continuing to evolve our portfolio in higher growth areas such as hygiene, prestige beauty, plantbased foods and functional nutrition - this will continue to influence the choices we make for organic investment as well as acquisitions and disposals. In 2020, we continued to expand our portfolio in functional nutrition through the acquisition of iconic health food drinks brands Horlicks and Boost as well as SmartyPants Vitamins and Liquid I.V. (see page 20 for more).\n\nDuring the year, we also conducted a strategic review of our global tea business - which includes brands such as Lipton, Brooke Bond and PG Tips - concluding that we would separate out the tea business as we evolve our portfolio (with the exception of our business in India and Indonesia and the partnership interests in the ready-to-drink tea joint ventures).",

        "page_content": "## 2. Winning with our brands as a force for good, powered by purpose and innovation\n\nWe have a long track record as a leader in sustainability. We're continuing to lead the way in sustainable business - ramping up our commitments on climate, nature and creating a fairer world (see pages 10 to 11 for more). We're embedding these commitments at the heart of our divisional, category and brand agendas.\n\nOur purposeful brands are key to delivering our sustainability ambitions and they are starting to cut through. Consumers now see 60% of our brands as more purposeful, taking meaningful, tangible action on issues that they care deeply about. We're innovating to ensure our brands also excel through their quality and efficacy. See the consumer review on pages 20 to 23 for more examples of brands with purpose and innovation.\n\n## 3. Accelerating in the USA, India, China and key growth markets\n\nWe have strong brand and category positions in major markets such as the US and China and a market leadership position in India - together these three countries represent nearly 35% of our turnover today and are forecast to account for over half of global GDP growth by 2030. Beyond these three key markets lies much opportunity in key growth markets of the future - for example our strong operating businesses in Brazil, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Mexico, each deliver more than \u20ac1 billion in sales every year - and we're continuing to build on our unrivalled route-to-market strength in these and other expanding markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In focus:\n\n## Our multi-year financial framework\n\nWe will deliver long-term value creation by continuing to evolve our portfolio and driving earnings growth, a strong cash flow and a growing dividend. We expect to do this through:\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying sales growth ahead of our markets, delivering USG in the range of 3% to 5%\n- \u25a0 Profit growth ahead of sales growth, on a comparable basis\n- \u25a0 Sustained strong cash flow over the long term\n- \u25a0 Savings of \u20ac2 billion per year from our well-established Fuel for Growth savings programmes\n- \u25a0 Restructuring investment of around \u20ac1 billion for 2021 and 2022; lower thereafter\n- \u25a0 ROIC in the mid-to-high teens\n- \u25a0 Net debt to underlying EBITDA at around 2x\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u20ac7.7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. Leading in the channels of the future\n\nWe're designing for growth channels like eCommerce through focused channel teams working to make sure we have the right portfolio and execution with strategies based on deep shopper insights. Our eCommerce focused innovations include smart packaging solutions designed for home delivery.\n\nThe right portfolio for eCommerce must be supported by operations built for this channel, from demand-anticipating algorithms to fast order fulfilment, and we're becoming more agile throughout our supply chain and operations. The explosion of eCommerce is also transforming the decadesold distributive trade and bringing new opportunities for our eB2B programmes. See the customers, suppliers and business partners review on pages 26 to 27 for more.\n\n## 5. Building a purpose-led, future-fit organisation and growth culture\n\nOur people are key to delivering our strategy, so we're focusing on our capacity, capability and culture. Agile ways of working and digital transformation are allowing us to find new capacity and refocus our people on the highest value work. We're equipping our employees with the skills they'll need to adapt to a changing world of work and to continue to grow our business. See pages 16 to 19 for more on our people.\n\nWe're continuing to unlock fuel for growth through our established savings programmes like 5S (a holistic programme covering pricing, product sourcing and product design) and zero-based budgeting, as well as our organisational change programmes.\n\nIn 2021 and beyond, we will continue to demonstrate how sustainable business drives superior performance - building on our strengths that position us well for the consumer and demographic trends of the future, and delivering on our strategic choices to create long-term value for all our stakeholders.",

This included an unfavourable currency impact of 5.4% driven by weakening of currencies in our key markets such as Brazil, Argentina and India. Underlying sales growth contributed 1.9% to turnover. Covid-19 had a significant impact on consumer behaviour and on the performance of a number of our categories. There was growth in hand and home hygiene, laundry products and inhome food and refreshment. However sales in personal care except for hygiene products were adversely impacted. Food solutions and out of home ice cream sales declined, impacted by channel closures. Overall acquisition and disposal activities made a positive contribution of 1.2% to turnover mainly from the health food drinks portfolio acquired from GlaxoSmithKline. This included brands such as Horlicks and Boost. This acquisition along with the acquisitions of Liquid IV and SmartyPants Vitamins in the USA, increased Unilever's presence in functional nutrition. More details on acquisitions and disposals are in note 21 on pages 162 to 165.\n\nEmerging markets underlying sales grew by 1.2%. In China and India sales were severely impacted by strict lockdowns at the beginning of the year but returned to growth in the second half. Latin America grew mid-single digit and Indonesia grew slightly. Developed markets underlying sales grew by 2.9% led by a strong performance in North America in-home foods. Europe declined by 1.0% for the full year due to a continued deflationary retail environment and a decline in out of home\n\nice cream, but returned to growth in the final quarter. Globally, eCommerce grew by 61% during the year and now accounts for 9% of Unilever sales.\n\nOperating profit was \u20ac8.3 billion which included \u20ac1.1 billion of non-underlying items, primarily restructuring costs. Restructuring costs are comprised of supply chain optimisation projects to improve gross margin and improve network agility, and organisational change projects to reduce overheads. The Supply Chain investments were concentrated in the manufacturing and logistics networks, particularly in Europe and the Americas.\n\nUnderlying operating profit was \u20ac9.4 billion, a decrease of 5.8%. This included an unfavourable currency impact of 6.5%. Underlying operating margin decreased by 60bps. Gross margin decreased by 50bps which included a negative impact of 90bps from the additional costs needed to adapt and run our supply chain plus an adverse product mix impact as a result of changes in consumer behaviour relating to Covid-19. Brand and marketing investment as a percentage of turnover was flat year on year. While investment was conserved in the first half during the early lockdown periods, we invested strongly behind our brands in the second half. Overheads increased by 10bps reflecting an adverse currency impact.\n\nFree cash flow was \u20ac7.7 billion in 2020 compared to \u20ac6.1 billion in the prior year. The improvement was led by favourable working capital movements as well as lower capital expenditure following re-phased investment to preserve cash and supply flexibility in light of Covid-19.\n\nHighlights for the year ended\n\n|                                         | Beauty & Personal Care   | Beauty & Personal Care   | Foods & Refreshment   | Foods & Refreshment   | Home Care   | Home Care   | Group   | Group   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n|                                         | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020        | 2019        | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Turnover (\u20ac million)                    | 21,124                   | 21,868                   | 19,140                | 19,287                | 10,460      | 10,825      | 50,724  | 51,980  |\n| Underlying sales growth (%)             | 1.2                      | 2.6                      | 1.3                   | 1.5                   | 4.5         | 6.1         | 1.9     | 2.9     |\n| Underlying volume growth (%)            | 1.2                      | 1.7                      | 0.1                   | (0.2)                 | 5.1         | 2.9         | 1.6     | 1.2     |\n| Underlying price growth (%)             | -                        | 0.9                      | 1.1                   | 1.7                   | (0.6)       | 3.1         | 0.3     | 1.6     |\n| Operating profit (\u20ac million)            | 4,311                    | 4,520                    | 2,749                 | 2,811                 | 1,243       | 1,377       | 8,303   | 8,708   |\n| Underlying operating profit (\u20ac million) | 4,591                    | 4,960                    | 3,257                 | 3,382                 | 1,519       | 1,605       | 9,367   | 9,947   |\n| Operating margin (%)                    | 20.4                     | 20.7                     | 14.4                  | 14.6                  | 11.9        | 12.7        | 16.4    | 16.8    |\n| Underlying operating margin (%)         | 21.7                     | 22.7                     | 17.0                  | 17.5                  | 14.5        | 14.8        | 18.5    | 19.1    |\n| Return on assets (%)                    | 140                      | 124                      | 69                    | 61                    | 129         | 99          | 102     | 89      |\n| Free cash flow (\u20ac million)              |                          |                          |                       |                       |             |             | 7,671   | 6,132   |",

Underlying sales growth was 1.2% and there was a positive contribution of 0.9% from acquisition and disposal activities.\n\nSkin cleansing saw mid-teens volume-led growth which was driven by the important role of hand hygiene in combatting the spread of Covid-19. Our Lifebuoy hygiene brand grew by over 50%, launching 'H is for Handwashing', an educational campaign to teach children the importance of handwashing with soap. Lockdowns and restricted living in our markets led to lower demand for skin care, deodorants and hair care, which each saw volume and price declines. Skin care declined high-single digit and deodorants declined mid-single digit. In hair care, growth in wash and care partially offset a decline in styling products, leading to a low-single digit decline overall. Oral care grew with price growth more than offsetting negative volumes driven by supply disruption related to lockdowns in key markets. Our Prestige Beauty business was impacted by health and beauty salon and retail closures, and declined low single digit. Prestige eCommerce performed strongly and over 50% of Prestige Beauty sales are now through eCommerce.\n\nUnderlying operating profit decreased by \u20ac369 million. This was due to a \u20ac169 million impact from the decline in turnover and \u20ac200 million from increased costs related to Covid-19 and an adverse product mix impact partially offset by a reduction in brand and marketing investment, as we conserved spend during lockdown periods, before significantly stepping up investment in the second half. Non-underlying items were \u20ac280 million, \u20ac160 million lower than prior year due to lower restructuring costs. Operating profit decreased by \u20ac209 million.\n\n## Foods & Refreshment\n\nTurnover declined by 0.8% including an unfavourable currency impact of 4.2%. Underlying sales growth was 1.3% and there was a positive contribution of 2.3% from acquisitions and disposals.\n\nOur retail foods business grew double digit, as restricted living led to more in-home eating occasions. Hellmann's grew highsingle digit, supported by its Stay In(spired) campaign, and our plant-based brand The Vegetarian Butcher grew by over 70%. Food solutions declined by 30% as out of home channels remained closed for much of the year. Despite significant decline in the out of home business due to channel closures, ice cream grew slightly overall as we rapidly shifted resources towards the in-home business. Ben and Jerry's performed strongly, teaming up with Netflix on its new 'Netflix and Chill'd' variant. Tea grew low single digit.\n\nUnderlying operating profit decreased by \u20ac125 million. This was due to a \u20ac35 million impact from the decline in turnover and \u20ac90 million from increased costs related to Covid-19, an adverse product mix impact and higher commodity costs in the second half of the year. Non-underlying items were \u20ac508 million primarily related to restructuring and were \u20ac63m lower than prior year. Operating profit decreased by \u20ac62 million.\n\n## Home Care\n\nTurnover declined by 3.4% including an unfavourable currency impact of 7.5% partially offset by underlying sales growth of 4.5%.\n\nOur home and hygiene brands delivered high-teens volume-led growth as we responded to increased demand for products with germ-killing and antibacterial benefits. Domestos grew by over 25% as we launched the brand in China and introduced spray and wipe formats. Our living hygiene range of local brands grew over 50%, led by Lysoform's educational campaigns in Italy. Within the fabric category, fabric solutions declined slightly, driven by lower consumer prices as we passed on some of the benefits of reduced commodity costs in the second half of the year. Capsules and liquids continued to grow. Low-single digit growth in fabric sensations was led by Indonesia and by Turkey, where our relaunched Snuggle (Yumos) brand performed well.\n\nUnderlying operating profit decreased by \u20ac86 million. This was due to a \u20ac54 million impact from the decline in turnover and \u20ac32 million from increased brand and marketing investment as we invested strongly behind our brands in the second half of the year. Overheads and gross margin improved, helped by lower material costs, despite Covid-19 related costs and negative price. Non-underlying items were \u20ac276 million, \u20ac48 million higher than prior year due to higher restructuring costs. Operating profit decreased by \u20ac134 million.",

The Main Horlicks Acquisition was the primary driver of the increase in goodwill and intangible assets. Total consideration paid was \u20ac5,294 million of which \u20ac449 million was paid in cash and \u20ac4,845 million paid in shares of Hindustan Unilever Limited. Intangible assets and goodwill arising from this acquisition were \u20ac3.3 billion and \u20ac2.0 billion respectively. See note 21 on page 162 to 165 for more.\n\nOther non-current assets decreased by \u20ac0.8 billion as a result of re-phased capital expenditure investment and the impact of currency. Current assets decreased by \u20ac0.3 billion driven by the \u20ac1.8 billion decrease in trade and other current receivables offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac1.4 billion due to stronger than expected cash delivery and additional bond issuance to build up cash ahead of 2021 bond maturities.\n\nNon-controlling interest increased by \u20ac1.7 billion relating to the Main Horlicks Acquisition which was partly settled through the issue of new shares of Hindustan Unilever to GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n## Movement in net pension liability/asset\n\nThe table below shows the movement in net pension liability/ asset during the year. Pension assets net of liabilities were in surplus of \u20ac0.3 billion at the end of 2020 compared with a deficit of \u20ac0.2 billion at the end of 2019. Strong positive investment performance was offset by an increase in liabilities as interest rates fell. There were refinements in assumption methodologies to reflect changes being made more generally by corporates and their advisers in setting discount rates and future inflation rates, specifically in the UK, which resulted in a \u20ac0.9 billion lower liability.\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                                                   | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 1 January                                         | (196)   |\n| Current service cost                              | (223)   |\n| Employee contributions                            | 17      |\n| Actual return on plan assets (excluding interest) | 1,494   |\n| Net interest cost                                 | (9)     |\n| Actuarial loss                                    | (1,246) |\n| Employer contributions                            | 398     |\n| Currency retranslation                            | 78      |\n| Other movements (a)                               | (26)    |\n| 31 December                                       | 287     |\n\n## Finance and liquidity\n\nApproximately \u20ac3.0 billion (or 54%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in the parent and central finance companies, for maximum flexibility. These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short and long-term debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 149 to 155. The remaining \u20ac2.5 billion (or 46%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes \u20ac98 million (2019: \u20ac146 million, 2018: \u20ac154 million) of cash that is",

The undrawn bilateral committed credit facilities in place on 31 December 2020 were $7,965 million.\n\n## Contractual obligations at 31 December 2020\n\n|                                         | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million Due  within 1 year   | \u20ac million Due in  1-3  years   | \u20ac million Due in  3-5  years   | \u20ac million Due in  over  5 years   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Bonds                                   | 22,902           | 1,639                          | 4,690                          | 4,988                          | 11,585                            |\n| Commercial paper,  bank and other loans | 2,280            | 2,271                          | 8                              | -                              | 1                                 |\n| Interest on financial  liabilities      | 3,235            | 429                            | 755                            | 616                            | 1,435                             |\n| Lease liabilities                       | 2,098            | 442                            | 644                            | 421                            | 591                               |\n| Other lease  commitments                | 158              | 69                             | 56                             | 24                             | 9                                 |\n| Purchase obligations (a)                | 400              | 343                            | 47                             | 7                              | 3                                 |\n| Other long-term  commitments            | 1,156            | 501                            | 493                            | 147                            | 15                                |\n| Other financial liabilities             | 236              | 117                            | 45                             | 74                             | -                                 |\n| Total                                   | 32,465           | 5,811                          | 6,738                          | 6,277                          | 13,639                            |\n\n(a)  For raw and packaging materials and finished goods.\n\nFurther details are set out in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: note 10 on pages 137 to 139, note 15C on page 147 and 148, and note 20 on page 161. Unilever is satisfied that its financing arrangements are adequate to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable future. In relation to the facilities available to the Group, borrowing requirements do not fluctuate materially during the year and are not seasonal.\n\n## Guaranteed US debt securities\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group had in issue US$11.5 billion (2019: US$12.35 billion; 2018: US$12.5 billion) bonds in connection with a US shelf registration. See page 203 for more information on these bonds and related commentary on guarantor information.\n\n## Non-GAAP measures\n\nCertain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report and Accounts (and the Additional Information for US Listing Purposes) include measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS. We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance, and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Wherever appropriate and practical, we provide\n\nreconciliations to relevant GAAP measures.\n\n## Explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures\n\nUnilever uses 'constant rate' and 'underlying' measures primarily for internal performance analysis and targeting purposes. We present certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior year average exchange rates into euro, except for the local currency of entities that operate in hyperinflationary economies. These currencies are translated into euros using the prior year closing exchange rate before the application of IAS 29.\n\nThe table below shows exchange rate movements in our key markets.\n\nAnnual\n\n|                              |   average  rate in 2020 |   Annual  average  rate in 2019 |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Brazilian real (\u20ac1 = BRL)    |                   5.781 |                           4.367 |\n| Chinese yuan (\u20ac1 = CNY)      |                   7.862 |                           7.725 |\n| Indian rupee (\u20ac1 = INR)      |                  84.1   |                          78.812 |\n| Indonesia rupiah (\u20ac1 = IDR)  |               16557     |                       15863     |\n| Philippine peso (\u20ac 1 = PHP)  |                  56.447 |                          58.112 |\n| UK pound sterling (\u20ac1 = GBP) |                   0.888 |                           0.88  |\n| US dollar (\u20ac1 = US$)         |                   1.135 |                           1.12  |\n\nIn the following sections we set out our definitions of the following non-GAAP measures and provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures:\n\n- \u25a0 underlying sales growth;\n- \u25a0 underlying volume growth;\n- \u25a0 underlying price growth;\n- \u25a0 non-underlying items;\n- \u25a0 underlying earnings per share;\n- \u25a0 underlying operating profit and underlying operating margin;\n- \u25a0 underlying effective tax rate;\n- \u25a0 constant underlying earnings per share;\n- \u25a0 free cash flow;\n- \u25a0 return on assets;\n- \u25a0 net debt; and\n- \u25a0 return on invested capital.\n\n## Underlying sales growth\n\nUnderlying Sales Growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions, disposals, changes in currency and price growth in excess of 26% in hyperinflationary economies. Inflation of 26% per year compounded over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from USG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself.",

For each Division operating margin is computed as operating profit divided by turnover and underlying operating margin is computed as underlying operating profit divided by turnover.\n\n## Underlying earnings per share\n\nUnderlying earnings per share (underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group. Refer to note 7 for reconciliation of net profit attributable to shareholders' equity to underlying profit attributable to shareholders equity.\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate\n\nThe underlying effective tax rate is calculated by dividing taxation excluding the tax impact of non-underlying items by profit before tax excluding the impact of non-underlying items and share of net profit/(loss) of joint ventures and associates. This measure reflects the underlying tax rate in relation to profit before tax excluding non-underlying items before tax and share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures and associates.\n\nTax impact on non-underlying items within operating profit is the sum of the tax on each non-underlying item, based on the applicable country tax rates and tax treatment.\n\nThis is shown in the table:\n\n|                                                                                                                               | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Taxation                                                                                                                      | 1,923            | 2,263            |\n| Tax impact of:                                                                                                                |                  |                  |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit (a)                                                                              | 272              | 309              |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit  but within net profit (a)                                                       | (146)            | (196)            |\n| Taxation before tax impact of non-underlying                                                                                  | 2,049            | 2,376            |\n| Profit before taxation                                                                                                        | 7,996            | 8,289            |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit  before tax (a)                                                                  | 1,064            | 1,239            |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit  but within net profit before tax (b)                                            | 36               | (32)             |\n| Share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures   and associates                                                                 | (175)            | (176)            |\n| Profit before tax excluding non-underlying  items before tax and share of net profit/(loss)  of joint ventures and associates | 8,921            | 9,320            |\n| Underlying effective tax rate                                                                                                 | 23.0%            | 25.5%            |\n\n## Constant underlying earnings per share\n\nConstant underlying earnings per share (constant underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity at constant exchange rates and excluding the impact of both translational hedges and price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies divided by the diluted average number of ordinary share units.

The annual average is computed by adding the amounts at the beginning and the end of the calendar year and dividing by two.\n\n| 2020                                         | \u20ac million  Beauty &  Personal Care   | \u20ac million  Foods &  Refreshment   | \u20ac million   Home  Care   | \u20ac million   Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Underlying operating profit before tax       | 4,591                                | 3,257                             | 1,519                    | 9,367               |\n| Tax on underlying operating profit           | (1,057)                              | (748)                             | (349)                    | (2,154)             |\n| Underlying operating profit after tax        | 3,534                                | 2,509                             | 1,170                    | 7,213               |\n| Property plant and equipment                 | 3,763                                | 4,895                             | 1,900                    | 10,558              |\n| Net assets held for sale                     | 2                                    | 10                                | 15                       | 27                  |\n| Inventories                                  | 1,817                                | 1,894                             | 751                      | 4,462               |\n| Trade and other receivables                  | 2,057                                | 1,864                             | 1,018                    | 4,939               |\n| Trade payables and other current liabilities | (5,649)                              | (5,428)                           | (3,055)                  | (14,132)            |\n| Period end assets (net)                      | 1,990                                | 3,235                             | 629                      | 5,854               |\n| Average assets for the period (net)          | 2,523                                | 3,614                             | 906                      | 7,043               |\n| Division return on assets                    | 140%                                 | 69%                               | 129%                     | 102%                |\n| 2019                                         |                                      |                                   |                          |                     |\n| Underlying operating profit before tax       | 4,960                                | 3,382                             | 1,605                    | 9,947               |\n| Tax on underlying operating profit           | (1,265)                              | (862)                             | (409)                    | (2,536)             |\n| Underlying operating profit after tax        | 3,695                                | 2,520                             | 1,196                    | 7,411               |\n| Property plant and equipment                 | 4,382                                | 5,336                             | 2,344                    | 12,062              |\n| Net assets held for sale                     | 5                                    | 63                                | 10                       | 78                  |\n| Inventories                                  | 1,793                                | 1,698                             | 673                      | 4,164               |\n| Trade and other receivables                  | 2,817                                | 2,484                             | 1,394                    | 6,695               |\n| Trade payables and other current liabilities | (5,941)                              | (5,588)                           | (3,239)                  | (14,768)            |\n| Period end assets (net)                      | 3,056                                | 3,993                             | 1,182                    | 8,231               |\n| Average assets for the period (net)          | 2,985                                | 4,146                             | 1,204                    | 8,335               |\n| Division return on assets                    | 124%                                 | 61%                               | 99%                      | 89%                 |\n\n## Other information\n\n## Accounting standards and critical accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

        "page_content": "## Our risks\n\n## Our risk appetite and approach to risk management\n\nRisk management is integral to Unilever's strategy and to the achievement of Unilever's long-term goals. Our success as an organisation depends on our ability to identify and exploit the opportunities generated by our business and the markets we are in. In doing this we take an embedded approach to risk management which puts risk and opportunity assessment at the core of the Board agenda, which is where we believe it should be.\n\nUnilever's appetite for risk is driven by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Our growth should be consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible.\n- \u25a0 Our actions on issues such as plastic and climate change must reflect their urgency, and not be constrained by the uncertainty of potential impacts.\n- \u25a0 Our behaviours must be in line with our Code of Business Principles and Code Policies.\n- \u25a0 Our ambition to continuously improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness.\n- \u25a0 Our aim to maintain a single A credit rating on a long-term basis.\n\nOur approach to risk management is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that our assets are safeguarded, the risks facing the business are being assessed and mitigated, and all information that may be required to be disclosed is reported to Unilever's senior management including, where appropriate, the CEO and CFO.\n\nOur overall risk appetite and approach to risk management has not changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the potential impact and likelihood of certain of our principal risks, see pages 46 to 50 for further details.\n\n## Organisation\n\nThe Board has overall accountability for the management of risk and for reviewing the effectiveness of Unilever's risk management and internal control systems. The Board has established a clear organisational structure with well-defined accountabilities for the principal risks that Unilever faces in the short, medium and long term. This organisational structure and distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensure that every country in which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk reviews and risk mitigation. This is supported by the ULE, which takes active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever. The Board regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n## Foundation and principles\n\nUnilever's approach to doing business is framed by our Purpose and values (see pages 10 and 11). Our Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere to. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied rests with senior management across divisions, geographies and functions. A network of Business Integrity Officers and Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the Code, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including support lines) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to capture and communicate learnings.\n\nWe have a framework of Code Policies that underpins the Code of Business Principles and sets out the non-negotiable standards of behaviour expected from all our employees.\n\nFor each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating that risk. Unilever's functional standards define mandatory requirements across a range of specialist areas such as health and safety, accounting and reporting and financial risk management and are key controls in mitigating these risks.\n\nOur assessment of risk considers both short- and long-term risks, including how these risks are changing, together with emerging risk areas. These are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and formally by senior management and the Board at least once a year.\n\nGiven the significant change in the operating environment as a result of Covid-19 and to ensure the implications on our principal risks were clearly understood and the appropriate mitigation plans were put in place, an additional formal review of our risks was undertaken by senior management and the Board this year.\n\n## Processes\n\nUnilever operates a wide range of processes and activities across all its operations covering strategy, planning, execution and performance management. Risk management is integrated into every stage.\n\n## Assurance and re-assurance\n\nAssurance on compliance with the Code of Business Principles and all of our Code Policies is obtained annually from Unilever management via a formal Code declaration. In addition, there are specialist awareness and training programmes which are run throughout the year and vary depending on the business priorities. These specialist compliance programmes supplement the Code declaration. Our Corporate Audit function plays a vital role in providing to both management and the Board an objective and independent review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems throughout Unilever.\n\n## Board assessment of compliance with the risk management frameworks\n\nThe Board, advised by the Committees where appropriate, regularly review the significant risks and decisions that could have a material impact on Unilever. These reviews consider the level of risk that Unilever is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate the risk exposure. Since March 2020 these have all taken into consideration the impact of Covid-19 on the risks and decisions being undertaken.\n\nThe Board, through the Audit Committee, have reviewed the assessment of risks, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in operation within Unilever. They have also considered the effectiveness of any remedial actions taken for the year covered by this Annual Report and Accounts and up to the date of its approval by the Board.\n\nDetails of the activities of the Audit Committee in relation to this can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 70 to 71.\n\nFurther statements on compliance with the specific risk management and control requirements in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the US Securities Exchange Act (1934) and the Sarbanes-Oxley (2002) Act can be found on page 69.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nThe Directors have reviewed the long-term prospects of the Group in order to assess its viability. This review incorporated the activities and key risks of the Group together with the factors likely to affect the Group's future development, performance, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities as described on pages 1 to 43. These factors have also been carefully assessed in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 143 to 160 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.\n\n## Assessment\n\nIn order to report on the long-term viability of the Group, the Directors reviewed the overall funding capacity and headroom available to withstand severe events and carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This assessment also included reviewing and understanding the mitigation factors in respect of each principal risk. The potential financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on both our overall funding capacity and our principal risks has also been considered given the wide range of potential outcomes. The risks and mitigating factors are summarised on pages 46 to 50.\n\nThe viability assessment has three parts:\n\n- \u25a0 First, the Directors considered the period over which they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities;\n- \u25a0 Second, they considered the current debt facilities and debt head room over the viability period, assuming that any debt maturing can be re-financed at commercially acceptable terms; and\n- \u25a0 Third, they considered the potential impact of severe but plausible scenarios over this period which included the potential ramifications that Covid-19 could have across the different areas of the Group, including:\n- \u25a0 assessing scenarios for each individual principal risk, for example the termination of our relationships with the three largest global customers; the loss of all material litigation cases; a major IT data breach, reputational damage from not progressing against our plastic packaging commitments, and the lost cost and growth opportunities from not keeping up with technological changes;\n- \u25a0 assessing extreme scenarios that could arise specifically from the significant impact of Covid-19 on the macro economic conditions in which the Group is operating for an extended period of time, for example the collapse of the Group's out-of-home business; and\n- \u25a0 assessing scenarios that involve more than one principal risk, including the following multi-risk scenarios, including assumptions on how the impact of Covid-19 could exacerbate the negative consequences of more than one principal risk:\n\n| Multi-risk scenarios modelled                                                                                                                                                                       | Level of severity reviewed                                                                                                                                                                        | Link to principal risk                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Contamination issue with one of our products leading to  lower sales of products of this brand and the temporary  closure of our largest sourcing unit.                                             | A fine equal to 1% of Group turnover was  considered along with damage to our largest  brand and disruption to supply chain.                                                                      | \u25a0 Safe and high-quality products \u25a0 Brand preference \u25a0 Supply chain   |\n| Major global incident affecting one or more of the  Group's key locations resulting in an outage for a year  in a key sourcing unit and significant water shortages in  our key developing markets. | The complete loss of all of our turnover in our  largest geographic market was considered along  with destruction of a key sourcing unit and reduced  demand for our products that require water. | \u25a0 Economic and political instability \u25a0 Supply chain \u25a0 Climate change |\n| Lack of progress against our plastic packaging  ambitions and the loss of our three largest customers.                                                                                              | Significant reputational damage was   considered with the impact of losing our   three key customers.                                                                                             | \u25a0 Plastic packaging \u25a0 Brand preference \u25a0 Customer                    |\n| Collapse of the global out-of-home business as a result   of Covid-19, combined with liquidity issues arising from   a deterioration in the financial markets.                                      | The complete closure of our foods and ice   cream out of home business combined with   the withdrawal of our standby facility.                                                                    | \u25a0 Treasury and tax \u25a0 Economic and political instability              |\n\n## Findings\n\n- \u25a0 Firstly, a three-year period is considered appropriate for this viability assessment because it is the period covered by the strategic plan and it enables a high level of confidence in assessing viability, even in extreme adverse events, due to a number of factors such as:\n- \u25a0 the Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world;\n- \u25a0 high cash generation by the Group's operations and access to the external debt markets;\n- \u25a0 flexibility of cash outflow with respect to significant marketing programmes and capital expenditure projects which usually have a two to three year horizon; and\n- \u25a0 the Group's diverse product and geographical activities which are impacted by continuously evolving technology and innovation.\n- \u25a0 Secondly, the Group's debt headroom and funding profile has been assessed and further challenged in light of expected impacts of Covid-19. None of the future outlooks considered resulted in significant liquidity headroom issues, primarily because:\n- \u25a0 the Group has a healthy balance of short-term and long-term debt programmes, with repayment profiles ensuring short-term commercial paper maturities do not exceed \u20ac0.5 billion in any given week and long-term debt maturities do not exceed \u20ac4 billion in any given year; and\n- \u25a0 the Group has $7.965 billion of committed credit facilities with a maturity of 364 days which are used as back up for our commercial paper programmes.\n- \u25a0 Thirdly, for each of our 14 principal risks, worst case plausible scenarios have been assessed together with multiple-risk scenarios. None of the scenarios reviewed, which have been adjusted for the expected long-term economic downturn arising from the impact of Covid-19, either individually or in aggregate would cause Unilever to cease to be viable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn the basis described above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.",

        "page_content": "## Principal risks\n\nOur business is subject to risks and uncertainties. On the following pages we have identified the risks that we regard as the most relevant to our business. These are the risks that we see as most material to Unilever's business and performance at this time. There may be other risks that could emerge in the future. Our principal risks include risks that could impact our business in the short-term (i.e. the next two years), medium term (i.e. the next three to ten years) or over the longer term (i.e. beyond ten years).\n\nOur principal risks have not changed this year. Albeit the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the potential impact and likelihood of certain of these risks and much focus has been given to managing these risks during the year to mitigate the increased level of the inherent risk. We identified the following areas as the ones with the most impact on our risk profile:\n\n- \u25a0 Safety and wellbeing of our employees: this is vital and we acted quickly to take relevant actions such as working from home, global restrictions on travel and the provision of protective equipment for factory workers and changes in working practices to facilitate social distancing. The safety of those who continue to operate in our workplaces as well as the mental and physical wellbeing of employees facing an extended period of working from home continues to be of paramount importance. We also have stringent return to office criteria and revised hygiene protocols to ensure a safe return to the office when possible;\n- \u25a0 Continuity of supply: maintaining manufacturing operations whilst adhering to changing local regulations and meeting enhanced health and safety standards has proven possible but has required significant management. In addition, ensuring the operation of a global logistics network for both input materials and finished goods has presented challenges and requires continuous focus and flexibility;\n- \u25a0 Product relevance: we have seen significant shifts in demand across different product categories and increased volatility in demand as consumer behaviour changes as the pandemic evolves. Further changes are likely as we enter a global recession;\n- \u25a0 Channel capabilities: social distancing requirements and the restrictions on many individuals' movements has driven a rapid increase in on online shopping and thus we are having to develop our capabilities in this area rapidly; and\n- \u25a0 IT availability, capability and resilience: given the change in ways of working there is an increased reliance on our systems thus keeping the IT infrastructure operating effectively and having the ability to resolve issues remotely is critical. This is particularly complex given our reliance on a variety of third parties in this space.\n\nAs Covid-19 has rather overshadowed the external environment this year we have not identified any other factors that have had a significant impact on the level of risk associated with each of our principal risks. However, while Covid-19 has significantly impacted the business this year, it also has the characteristics of an emerging risk and it is difficult for us to predict how things will unfold in 2021, both with respect to the short and long-term implications for our business.\n\nWe set out below certain mitigating actions that we believe help us to manage our principal risks. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. If the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described, which may include forward-looking statements, or could impact on our ability to meet our targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk                  | Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Management of risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Level of risk   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Brand  preference     | Our success depends on the value and relevance of  our brands and products to consumers around the  world and on our ability to innovate and remain  competitive.

It will also impact our business and supply chain.\n\nWe believe the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050 - preferably much earlier - to avoid the worst effects of climate change. We advocate for national climate policies that advance the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to limit global temperature increases to well below 2\u00b0C, and ideally no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nWe believe businesses have an important role to play in taking decisive action to fight climate change. We are one of the world's largest consumer goods companies and our greenhouse gas emissions footprint is significant. Much of our footprint comes from raw material sourcing and consumer use of our products and we use our influence to reduce emissions across the value chain.\n\nWe have set ambitious science-based targets to reduce our carbon footprint and we strongly support efforts to accelerate the decarbonisation of energy grids to reduce emissions from product use.\n\nWe support the aims of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and believe that businesses should communicate the risks and opportunities that climate change brings. The TCFD provides a framework to improve the disclosure of consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear climate-related financial information so that investors can make better capital allocation decisions in support of the transition to a low-carbon economy. Unilever has adopted the TCFD's recommendations since their establishment, to aid understanding of the impacts of climate change on our business.\n\nIn this Annual Report and Accounts, we continue to integrate climate-related disclosures throughout the Strategic Report. In this section, we discuss in detail the risks and opportunities arising from climate change, the potential impact on our business, and the actions we're taking to mitigate these risks.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board take overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including climate change (see page 44). Our CEO and Executive Board member, Alan Jope, is ultimately responsible for oversight of our climate change agenda. The Corporate Responsibility Committee and Audit Committee review our climate reporting and receive presentations from sustainability experts, including the Sustainability Advisory Council. The Board is supported by the ULE. The ULE meet monthly to discuss key strategic matters and during 2020, several agenda items related to climate change were discussed, including progress against our USLP climate goals and our new Compass climate goals.\n\nAdditional specialist governance groups are in place to support our climate agenda and ULE decision making, including:\n\n- \u25a0 Carbon Neutral Board: Drives delivery of our carbon ambition at corporate and country level and leads strategic partnerships and policy on renewables. Chaired by our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel.\n- \u25a0 Sustainable Sourcing Steering Group: Supports our strategy focusing on long-term, sustainable access to our key crops. Chaired by our Chief Procurement Officer, David Ingram.\n\nRemuneration linked to achievement of sustainability and climate change targets is a key part of our reward framework. For management employees - up to and including the ULE reward packages include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and eligibility to participate in a long-term management co-investment plan (MCIP) linked to financial and sustainability performance. The Sustainability Progress Index accounts for 25% of the total MCIP award. It includes amongst others consideration of progress against our manufacturing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas target and a deforestation goal covering palm oil. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM the MCIP will be replaced by a Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the performance measures for the PSP will continue to include the Sustainability Progress Index. See pages 92 to 93 for more on MCIP including the role of the Board's Compensation Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining the Sustainability Progress Index outcome each year and changes related to the PSP.\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nClimate change is a principal risk to Unilever which has the potential - to varying degrees - to impact our business in the short, medium and long term. We face potential physical risks from the effects of climate change on our business, including extreme weather and water scarcity. Potential transition risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy include changing consumer preferences and future policy and regulation. These also present opportunities.\n\nMore detail on these risks, opportunities and the mitigating actions we're taking is discussed on pages 55 to 56.\n\nThe process for assessing and identifying climate-related risks is the same for all principal risks and is described on page 44. For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place, who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it. We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.\n\nWe regularly carry out climate-related risk assessments at site level, supplier level, as well as innovation-project level. Climate-related risks are managed by the team relevant to where the risk resides. For example, climate risks in relation to commodities in the supply chain are managed by our procurement team.\n\nWe believe that the economy-wide shift to net zero emissions will require a greater and deeper level of engagement between companies and their investors about their climate transition action plans. In December 2020, the Board announced its intention to put Unilever's climate transition action plan before shareholders and seek a non-binding advisory vote on our ambitious emissions reduction targets and the plans to achieve them. The plan will set out our climate strategy to reduce emissions within our operations, through our value chain, as well as describe how we are managing risks and meeting consumer needs connected with climate change. In setting out our action plan in this very transparent way, we hope to increase our accountability and strengthen the dialogue with our shareholders whilst also encouraging other companies to follow suit.",

We used two types of scenario analysis:\n\n- 1.  Modelling the potential financial impact of average global temperature increases of 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C on our business in 2030.\n- 2.  Deep-dive analysis of the potential financial impact of climate change on three of our key agricultural commodities: soy, black tea and palm oil.\n\nWe plan to extend our scenario analysis to assess the impact of 1.5\u00b0C temperature increases to reflect the latest science and our commitment to limit global temperature increases, to well below 2\u00b0C and ideally no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n## 1. Modelling the potential financial impact of 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature increases on our business\n\nWe have made a high-level assessment of the impact of 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature increases due to climate change by 2100. Carried out in 2017, the assessment focused on the material impacts on our business in the year 2030. The modelling assumed that our business activities are the same as they are today. The scenarios were based on existing internal and external data.\n\nWhile we understand that policy risk and physical impact can happen simultaneously, we made the following simplifying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 In the 2\u00b0C scenario, we assumed that in the period to 2030 society acts rapidly to limit greenhouse gas emissions and puts in place measures to restrain deforestation and discourage emissions (for example implementing carbon pricing at $75-$100 per tonne, taken from the International Energy Agency's 450 scenario). We have assumed that there will be no significant impact to our business from the physical ramifications of climate change by 2030 - i.e. from greater scarcity of water or increased impact of severe weather events. The scenario assesses the impact on our business from regulatory changes.\n- \u25a0 In the 4\u00b0C scenario, we assumed climate policy is less ambitious and emissions remain high so the physical manifestations of climate change are increasingly apparent by 2030. Given this we have not included impacts from regulatory restrictions but focus on those resulting from the physical impacts.\n\nWe identified the material impacts on Unilever's business arising from each of these scenarios based on existing internal and external data. The impacts were assessed without considering any actions that Unilever might take to mitigate or adapt to the adverse impacts or to introduce new products which might offer new sources of revenue as consumers adjust to the new circumstances.\n\nThe main elements of the 2\u00b0C scenario are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Carbon pricing is introduced in key countries and hence there are increases in both manufacturing costs and the costs of raw materials such as dairy ingredients and the metals used in packaging.\n- \u25a0 Zero net deforestation requirements are introduced and a shift to sustainable agriculture e.g. Climate Smart Agriculture, puts pressure on agricultural production, raising the price of certain raw materials.\n\nThe main impacts of the 4\u00b0C scenario are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Chronic and acute water stress reduces agricultural productivity in some regions, raising prices of raw materials.\n- \u25a0 Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) causes increased incidence of disruption to our manufacturing and distribution networks.\n- \u25a0 Temperature increase and extreme weather events reduce economic activity, GDP growth and hence sales levels fall.\n\nOur analysis shows that, without action, both scenarios present financial risks to Unilever by 2030, predominantly due to increased costs. However, while there are financial risks which would need to be managed, we would not have to materially change our business model. The most significant impacts of both scenarios are on our supply chain where costs of raw materials and packaging rise, due to carbon pricing and rapid shift to sustainable agriculture in a 2\u00b0C scenario and due to chronic water stress and extreme weather in a 4\u00b0C scenario. The impacts on sales and our own manufacturing operations in the scenarios tested are relatively small.\n\n## Scenario: Potential impact of a 2\u00b0C temperature increase by 2100 (transition impacts)\n\n| Scenario drivers                                                                                             | Potential financial impact in   2030 if no actions to mitigate   risks are taken   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Increased costs due to   carbon pricing.                                                                     | Turnover:  Not material Expenditure: Estimated increase   of  \u20ac0.8bn               |\n| Increased raw material costs from  zero net deforestation policies and   a shift to sustainable agriculture. | Turnover:  Not material Expenditure: Estimated increase   of  \u20ac0.9bn               |\n\n## Scenario: Potential impact of a 4\u00b0C temperature increase by 2100 (physical impacts)\n\n| Scenario drivers                                                                                                                                          | Potential financial impact in   2030 if no actions to mitigate   risks are taken   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chronic and acute water stress  reduces agricultural productivity   in some regions, raising prices   of raw materials.                                   | Turnover:  Not material Expenditure: Estimated increase   of  \u20ac2.7bn               |\n| Increased frequency of   extreme weather (storms and  floods) causes increased incidence  of disruption to our manufacturing   and distribution networks. | Turnover: Estimated reduction   of  \u20ac0.4bn Expenditure:  Not material              |\n| Temperature increase and extreme  weather events reduce economic  activity, GDP growth and hence  sales levels fall.                                      | Turnover: Estimated reduction   of  \u20ac2.1bn Expenditure:  Not material              |",

        "page_content": "## 2. Deep-dive analysis of the potential financial impact of climate change on key agricultural commodities\n\nTo help us understand the potential impact of climate change on our supply chain, we've completed more detailed analysis on three of our key agricultural commodities: palm oil, soybean oil and black tea. We selected these commodities because of their strategic importance to Unilever, the large volumes we purchase and the availability of data.\n\nWe first piloted a methodology for soybean oil in 2018 and since 2019 we've worked with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to develop models for black tea and palm oil. Our methodology forecasts future yields using crop-specific and climate models. The price model uses a range of supply and demand drivers to determine the impact of changes in yield from direct risks of climate change, isolating other factors such as acreage and technology on price. Three modelling steps were performed:\n\n- \u25a0 Yield estimation: We analysed multiple crop and climate models to provide a forecast range of expected yields in key growing regions.\n- \u25a0 Price relationship: An econometric model was developed, based on an analysis of the raw material's market and historical trends, to estimate the impact of climate-induced yield changes on future prices. The model seeks to isolate the impact of yield changes on prices from other important factors such as acreage, farming technology, extreme weather events and man-made factors such as elections and governmental policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Palm oil\n\nWe are one of the largest buyers of palm oil in the consumer goods industry. It's an important raw material for many of our brands, including in food, beauty and household cleaning products.\n\nWhat we modelled: We worked with Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to develop suitable climate models for palm oil. We modelled yields for Indonesia and Malaysia, where most palm oil is produced, along with four other countries. The palm oil market operates globally so we used a single price model. The market is characterised by high monthly inventory levels (creating relatively stable prices), substitution with other oils such as sunflower oil, and government regulations on biodiesel. The price model controlled for these factors and isolated the effect of changes in yield from the direct impacts of climate change on prices.\n\nImpact on yields: Likely increase in palm oil yields due to CO 2 fertilisation in all countries modelled over the 2030 to 2050 timeframe, leading to between 18% and 42% lower palm oil prices.\n\nRisk profile: Low direct financial risk to our business.\n\nKey risks: Potential indirect risks from extreme weather events, which can't yet be sufficiently modelled. More palm oil acreage will be needed to meet demand, but concerns about deforestation could lead to changing regulations on land use that could limit growth and impact prices. For example, in Malaysia and Indonesia, the total land available for palm oil plantations is being capped or new plantation licenses have been halted. Despite the potential financial\n\n- \u25a0 Impact estimation: Future yields and price impacts were then translated into an estimated financial exposure from climate change for our business, using our forecast procurement volumes.\n\nWhile the 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios discussed above identified financial risks to our supply chain, when we looked into these specific commodities in more detail we found that overall, the direct financial impact on our business is low. This is because the high level 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenario analysis and the commodity-specific deep-dive analyses are modelling different conditions and the results cannot be directly compared. For the commodities and sourcing countries we modelled, climate change could increase crop growth due to CO 2 fertilisation and extended growing seasons, offsetting any downside risks from changing rainfall or temperature patterns.\n\nHowever, we do face higher risks in some specific scenarios modelled for black tea. In two of four countries modelled we found yields could decrease and prices increase, although overall the results for black tea showed yield increases so our total risk exposure remains low. We also face indirect risks relating to climate change which were not included in the modelling. These include the impacts of extreme weather events and external policy changes. We also face price disruption, reputational risks and land-use policy changes associated with deforestation. We considered these indirect impacts alongside the quantitative modelling and discuss results in more detail below.\n\nimpact to Unilever from deforestation regulation, we support policies that tackle deforestation associated with palm oil.\n\nWe also face significant corporate reputational risks associated with deforestation. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is essential to improving the sustainability and image of palm oil and land-use restrictions are a positive development. Palm oil could also become increasingly attractive compared to alternative oils because it produces the most oil per hectare, which could further stimulate demand and affect prices.\n\nMitigating actions: We are committed to ending deforestation in our supply chain by 2023 and we have been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change to ensure a sustainable future for palm oil, including as a founding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We were the first consumer goods company to publish a list of palm oil suppliers and mills and we expect all our suppliers to follow our Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Policy. This includes commitments to 'No deforestation, No development on peat and No exploitation'.\n\nWe are working with suppliers to increase traceability and transparency, including through using AI and technology solutions. For instance, we're working with Orbital Insight, a US technology company that specialises in using GPS technology to trace palm and soy used in our products back to the farmland it was grown on (see page 27). We also help smallholder farmers be more productive and adopt more sustainable techniques, supporting them with high-quality palm varieties, technology, finance and training.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability deep-dives continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Soybean oil\n\nSoybean oil is a crucial ingredient in many of our food products, such as mayonnaise, and we purchase large volumes mostly from growers in the US and Brazil, where there is significant stakeholder interest in the sustainability of the crop. Good historical price data is also readily available.\n\nWhat we modelled: We forecast future yields using crop and climate models. To estimate the impact of climate-induced yield changes on future soybean oil prices, we considered the role of co-products (e.g. soybean meal), the potential to substitute it with other oils such as sunflower oil, and the impact of industrial uses.\n\nImpact on yields: Likely average increase in soy yields over the 2030 to 2050 timeframe, leading to between 2% and 12% lower soy prices.\n\nRisk profile: Low direct financial risk to our business.\n\nKey risks: Potential indirect risks such as extreme weather events, which can't yet be sufficiently modelled, and corporate reputational risks from being associated with deforestation.

We source tea from our own tea estates, our suppliers, or from smallholder farmers across four continents.\n\nWhat we modelled: We worked with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to forecast future tea yields using crop and climate models. We similarly isolated the impact of climate-induced yield changes on prices from other important factors such as acreage, farming technology, tea quality, extreme weather events and manmade factors such as elections, unrest and governmental policy. The black tea market is highly fragmented and lacks liquidity so we modelled risks in four key sourcing countries: Argentina, India, Kenya and Turkey.\n\nImpact on yields: Varies between countries but on average, overall yields are expected to increase. Reduced yields are a particular risk in 2030 in a 2\u00b0C scenario in Kenya and in 2050 in a 4\u00b0C scenario in Argentina. Associated average price reductions are expected in most scenarios over a 30-year horizon.\n\nRisk profile: Some exposure to risk due to lower yields in Kenya and Argentina in some scenarios. However overall, there is a low direct financial risk to our black tea business from climate change across all four countries modelled.\n\nKey risks: Small potential price rises in Kenya and Argentina.\n\nmeet demand for soy meal use in animal feed, but concerns about deforestation could lead to changing regulations on land-use that could limit growth and impact prices. Despite the potential financial impact to Unilever from deforestation regulation, we support policies that tackle deforestation associated with soybean oil.\n\nMitigating actions: We are committed to ending deforestation in our supply chain by 2023. As a founding member of the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) we have worked with NGOs, governments and suppliers to develop an international standard and enable farmers to improve their practices and gain sustainable sourcing accreditation.\n\nWe are transparent about where we purchase soy from and publish a list of our direct suppliers. In the US our work with the Field to Market alliance and Practical Farmers of Iowa supports farmers to improve soil health and water quality. In Latin America we've been part of long-term collaborative efforts to improve the sustainability of soy cultivation. We're also increasing our use of AI and technology solutions to improve traceability.\n\nIn Kenya there is a risk of plateauing yields if additional acreage is not available due to government or land-use change policies in the 2\u00b0C scenario. In India, the declining quality of black tea could be a bigger risk to prices than yields, driven by water scarcity and temperature stress in both 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios. Extreme weather events and man-made factors (such as elections or public unrest) could also have a bigger - but very unpredictable - impact on prices and production than the direct impacts of climate change. Lack of appropriate substitutions for black tea also increases the risk profile.\n\nMitigating actions: Since 2014, we've developed diverse natural tea varieties that are more resilient to the impacts of climate change such as drought, as well as pests and disease. Our long-standing partnership with the Rainforest Alliance supports smallholder farmers to improve sustainable practices in Kenya and we're working with The Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) to reverse deforestation and improve rainfall to support tea growing. In India, we are a founding member of trustea, supporting sustainable practices across the country's tea estates. Together with Oxfam and the Ford Foundation, we created the Enhancing Livelihoods Fund (ELF), which aims to enhance the livelihoods of smallholders while securing ingredients sustainably. Our ELF programme in Kenya supports 200 women tea farmers with access to finance, skills and training to cultivate drought-resistant tea crops.",

        "page_content": "## Managing climate change risks and opportunities\n\nThe modelling scenarios presented above are useful to understand the potential financial impacts of climate change on our business, but there are limitations. Climate change impacts are systemic and unpredictable. Scenario analysis requires us to pick specific factors and model them using fixed assumptions.\n\nHowever, there are many wider potential impacts - including opportunities - that we can't capture from one type of modelling. For instance, we considered the impact of extreme weather in our 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios, but we did not quantify this in detail due to how unpredictable extreme weather events are. For this reason, we also look more broadly at possible physical and transition risks and opportunities to our business from climate change. In this section, we discuss the actions we're taking to mitigate these.\n\n## Physical: extreme weather\n\nRisks and opportunities: Our business depends on purchasing materials, efficient and uninterrupted manufacturing and the timely distribution of products to our customers. Our operating costs and commodity prices could be disrupted by increased frequency of extreme weather events and changes to weather systems. Our operations and assets could be physically damaged by extreme weather events, including damage or loss to our owned property or inventory of products. There are opportunities to adapt our operations and assets to be more resilient to extreme weather.\n\nActions we're taking: While the frequency and extent of extreme weather is hard to predict, we monitor changing weather patterns on a short-term basis and take action to mitigate any negative effects. We have contingency plans to secure alternative key material supplies at short notice, to transfer or share production between manufacturing sites and to substitute materials in products and recipes if needed. We manage commodity price risks through forward-buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms. We integrate weather system modelling into our forecasting process. Our Regenerative Agriculture Principles and Sustainable Agriculture Code promote the principles of Climate-Smart Agriculture to our suppliers and encourage practices to sustainably increase their productivity and resilience to extreme weather.\n\n## Physical: water stress\n\nRisks and opportunities: Household water scarcity, exacerbated by population growth and urbanisation is a physical risk to our business. Consumers may reduce use of certain products such as laundry detergents, shampoos, conditioners and toilet cleaners if they don't have access to water. Reduced water quality could also impact our products efficacy and consumers' enjoyment. We investigated the effects of water stress on our sales in the global scenario analysis and while we found the overall impact by 2030 is not significant, we could face greater short-term impacts in specific communities. We can pursue opportunities to develop new water-smart products and increase our market share among consumers concerned about water use or facing local water shortages.\n\nActions we're taking: We're investing in new products and formulations that work with less water, poor quality water or no water, with a particular focus on household cleaning, skin cleansing, oral and hair care. Many of our Beauty & Personal Care and Home Care products now have fast-rinse technology as standard, using less water or low-temperature washing. We recently committed to expand our water stewardship programme to 100 locations in water-stressed areas by 2030 (see page 30).\n\n## Transition: changing consumer preferences\n\nRisks and opportunities: Our growth and profitability depend on our ability to pre-empt or respond to changing consumer preferences. Public concern about climate change is higher than ever and consumers are increasingly choosing more sustainable brands. Consumers in a number of markets are increasingly adopting plant-based diets which have a lower GHG footprint than meat-based diets. Animal-based agriculture (including fats and protein) is associated with only around 7.5% of our Foods & Refreshment GHG footprint, and 2.5% of our total GHG footprint. We're capturing opportunities to develop new products and grow our consumer base by appealing to eco-conscious consumers.\n\nActions we're taking: We're developing lower carbon footprint products. We've spent years developing concentrated laundry detergents that fit more washes into smaller bottles, reducing packaging, manufacturing and transport emissions. Our Home Care division's Clean Future programme aims to eliminate fossil fuels from cleaning products by 2030. By embedding circular economy principles into both packaging and product formulations, we're shifting from using fossil-fuel derived feedstocks to renewable or recycled sources of carbon for cleaning chemicals. Our Foods & Refreshment brands offer a range of vegan and vegetarian variants and continue to actively promote vegetarian and vegan recipes (see page 22). A recent FAIRR report identified Unilever as a pioneer in developing alternatives to meat.\n\nIn recent years, our M&A strategy has been to acquire new businesses which serve specific consumer segments, such as sustainability-conscious consumers. A number of these, including Pukka Herbs, Seventh Generation and OLLY Nutrition, are recognised as B Corps - meaning they have met stringent environmental and social criteria as laid out in the B Corp impact assessment. Existing brands such as our T2 premium tea brand have also achieved B Corp certification. Seventh Generation advocates for renewable energy and is taking action to decarbonise its own business and Pukka Herbs has its own science-based zero carbon goal. In 2020, we launched a \u20ac1 billion Climate & Nature Fund which will be used over the next ten years by our brands to take meaningful and decisive action on climate change (see page 28).",

We are dependent on countries implementing their Paris Agreement commitments and in raising the ambition of those commitments.\n\nActions we're taking: Our science-based climate targets are one of the ways we mitigate the risk of future policy and regulation (see right). In 2020, we launched an additional climate goal, committing to net zero emissions from all our products by 2039 - from the sourcing of materials we use, up to the point of product sale.\n\nWe support the use of carbon pricing as an important tool to help us achieve our zero emissions objective. Our carbon pricing approach is a mechanism which creates a sustainable capital investment fund which is then used to fund the capital investments needed to decarbonise our operations. This has been operating since 2016 and, whilst there were some delays to the projects during 2020 due to Covid-19, we have continued to make progress in the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions in our operations. To ensure that we remain on track to deliver our ambition of zero emissions by 2030 we are committed to continue this capital investment programme.\n\nOver the past decade, we have worked with governments and others to drive action to end deforestation. We are committed to achieving a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023 (see page 29).\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nOur new Compass strategy includes stretching goals to address climate risks and opportunities across our value chain. Two of these GHG reduction targets have been recognised as science-based by the Science Based Target initiative:\n\n- \u25a0 Halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the lifecycle by 2030 (this is our full value chain goal and covers all greenhouse gas scopes and all the phases across the lifecycle of our products, including ingredients and raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, retail, packaging, consumer use and disposal, against a 2010 baseline). See page 34 for our progress and table right for our progress on Scope 3.\n- \u25a0 Reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 100% from our operations by 2030 (this is our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2030 from energy and refrigerant use, against a 2015 baseline). See table right for our progress on Scope 1 and 2.\n\nWe continuously review our GHG footprint estimations to ensure we are using the best available data and thus improve the accuracy of our GHG emissions reporting. These changes can affect both the 2010 baseline and the annual emissions that we report. In 2020 we concluded that the changes required in certain estimations were sufficiently material to require us to formally restate prior years reported changes in GHG emissions per consumer use. The impact of the new data was primarily in relation to the 2010 baseline and was due to the following factors:\n\n- 1.  A revision of our estimates about the amount of hot water used by consumers when using our products, such as shower gels, shampoos and washing up liquid.\n- 2.  The inclusion of the GHG emissions from the biodegradation of fossil-fuel derived ingredients at the end of a product's life in our Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care portfolio.\n- 3.  Errors in the GHG emissions from certain Savoury products.\n\nRelative to the revised 2010 baseline (50.5g CO 2 e per consumer use), our restated GHG performance was:\n\n- \u25a0 2018: 48.8g CO 2 e per consumer use, -3% versus 2010 (compared to +6% in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts).\n- \u25a0 2019: 46.7g CO 2 e per consumer use, -8% versus 2010 (compared to +2% in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts).\n- \u25a0 2020: 45.6g CO 2 e per consumer use, -10% versus 2010.\n\nWhile the GHG footprint results reported in this Annual Report and Accounts differ from those stated in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts, the direction of change over the past three years remains the same.\n\n## GHG emissions by activity\n\nIn line with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended by the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) Regulations 2013, our GHG emissions are set out below. The Scope 1 and 2 GHG data below relates to emissions during the 12-month period from 1 October to 30 September. The Scope 3 data relates to emissions during the 12-month period from 1 July to 30 June. These periods are different from the Strategic Report, Directors' Report and Financial Statements which are calendar year.\n\n|                                                                                                                       | 2020       | 2019                     | 2018                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Unilever operations   (Scope 1 and 2) (a)(b)(c)                                                                       |            |                          |                         |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 (tonnes CO 2 e) (d)                                                                               | 778,677    | 1,102,925                | 1,652,057               |\n| Scope 1 (tonnes CO 2 e) (e)                                                                                           | 606,771    | 659,028                  | 758,232                 |\n| Scope 2 (tonnes CO 2 ) (d)(f)                                                                                         | 171,906    | 443,897                  | 893,825                 |\n| Reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG  emissions from energy and  refrigerant use in our operations  since 2015 baseline (%) | 60%        | 44%                      | 16%                     |\n| Upstream and downstream of  Unilever operations (Scope 3) (g)(h)                                                      |            |                          |                         |\n| Total Scope 3 (tonnes CO 2 e)                                                                                         | 60,388,592 |                          | 61,020,357   62,017,585 |\n| Consumer use (tonnes CO 2 e) (i)                                                                                      | 42,093,341 | 41,743,454    42,281,468 |                         |\n| Ingredients and packaging  (tonnes CO 2 e) (i)(j)                                                                     | 14,239,918 | 14,897,174   15,367,491  |                         |\n| Distribution and retail   (tonnes CO 2 e) (k)                                                                         | 4,055,333  | 4,379,729                | 4,368,626               |",

We have recalculated consumer use to also include disposal, and ingredients and packaging to also include inbound transport of raw materials. As such, it is not comparable with the 2018 and 2019 Scope 3 data in our 2019 Annual Report and Accounts. Our Scope 3 reporting covers all indirect emissions by third parties in these phases of the value chain: raw materials (primary packaging, secondary packaging, ingredients), inbound transportation of raw materials into our factories, retail, consumer use, and disposal. Our top three Scope 3 emissions amount to more than 99% of our GHG footprint across our value chain.\n- (i) We measure the GHG footprint of our product portfolio using an LCA method compliant with the ISO 14040 standard. We measure the consumer use phase using a combination of primary habits data and on-pack recommendations of use combined with life-cycle inventory data. We measure a representative sample of products across 14 countries which account for around 60-70% of our annual sales volume.\n- (j) We use a combination of external life-cycle inventory databases (secondary data) and supplier-specific data (primary data e.g. for surfactants, perfumes and some of our food ingredients) to measure the GHG emissions of purchased ingredients and packaging materials used in the production of our products.\n- (k)   Downstream distribution is calculated using average distances and modes of transport derived from data collected from our distribution network and logistic providers.\n\n## Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting\n\nThe table below represents Unilever's energy use and associated GHG emissions from electricity and fuel in the UK (1 October to 30 September), calculated with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The scope of this data includes eight manufacturing sites and 11 non-manufacturing sites based in the UK. In 2020, the UK accounted for 6% of our global total Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as 6% of our global energy use, outlined in the table below.\n\n| UK operations                                             | 2020          | 2019                         | 2018 (a)    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|\n| Biogas (kWh)                                              | 9,420,000     | 17,045,000                   | 15,958,000  |\n| Natural gas (kWh)                                         | 231,832,000   | 238,081,000                  | 278,849,000 |\n| LPG (kWh)                                                 | 1,464,000     | 866,000                      | 1,513,000   |\n| Fuel oils (kWh)                                           | 59,000        | 580,000                      | 648,000     |\n| Coal (kWh)                                                | 0             | 0                            | 0           |\n| Electricity (kWh)                                         | 190,790,000   | 195,797,000                  | 219,141,000 |\n| Heat and steam (kWh)                                      | 201,709,000   | 212,483,000                  | 262,693,000 |\n| Total UK energy (kWh) (b)                                 | 392,499,000   | 408,280,000                  | 481,833,000 |\n| Total global energy  (kWh)                                | 7,037,674,000 | 7,181,904,000  7,853,609,000 |             |\n| Total UK Scope 1   emissions (tonnes CO 2 ) (c)           | 46,918        | 48,178                       | 56,533      |\n| UK Scope 1 emissions  (kg CO 2 ) per tonne of  production | 49.1          | 55.6                         | 56.4        |\n| Total UK Scope 2   emissions (tonnes CO 2 ) (c)(d)        | 527           | 702                          | 7,618       |\n| UK Scope 2 emissions  (kg CO 2 ) per tonne of  production | 0.6           | 0.8                          | 7.6         |\n\n- (a)   We have restated our 2018 data to correct errors at one site where natural gas was used to produce heat and steam, and electricity.

        "page_content": "## In focus: Plastic packaging\n\nWe believe that plastic has a place in the economy but not in the environment. We know it is a big concern for our stakeholders, and despite challenging conditions due to Covid-19 such as the availability of certain materials and the closure of sorting and recycling centres in some markets, we are fully committed to tackling plastic pollution. It is vital for us, and for the rest of the industry, to stay the course, cut the amount of plastic we use and rapidly transition to a circular economy. In this Annual Report and Accounts, we have integrated plastic packaging disclosures throughout the Strategic Report narrative. We have also summarised the key risks and opportunities arising from plastic packaging in this section of the report.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board takes overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including plastic packaging (see page 44). Our CEO and Executive Board member, Alan Jope, is ultimately responsible for oversight of our plastic packaging agenda. He is supported by the ULE, including our Chief R&D Officer, Richard Slater, who is responsible for driving the plastic strategy, and Divisional Presidents who lead the plastics agenda within their respective Divisions.\n\nThe Sustainable Packaging Committee supports ULE decision making and guides our strategy across all three Divisions. It has oversight of delivery and progress against our packaging goals, meets four times a year, is chaired by Richard Slater, and includes senior leaders and plastic packaging specialists from across our Divisions, markets and functions.\n\nPlastic packaging is a key part of our sustainability programme. Remuneration linked to achievement of sustainability and plastic targets is a key part of our reward framework. For management employees - up to and including the ULE - reward packages include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and eligibility to participate in a long-term management co-investment plan (MCIP) linked to financial and sustainability performance. The Sustainability Progress Index accounts for 25% of the total MCIP award. It includes, amongst others, consideration of progress against our target to increase the recycled plastic material content in our packaging. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM the MCIP will be replaced by a Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the performance measures for the PSP will continue to include the Sustainability Progress Index. See pages 92 to 93 for more on MCIP including the role of the Board's Compensation Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining the Sustainability Progress Index outcome each year and changes related to the PSP.\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nPlastic has been identified as a principal risk for the company which has the potential to impact our business in the short, medium and long term. The process for assessing and identifying plastic packaging risk is the same for all principal risks and is described on page 44. For each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it. We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.\n\nWe have taken decisive action to mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunities. In 2017, we were the first\n\ncompany in our industry to commit to ensuring that 100% of our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. In 2019, we announced two new goals to complement the 2017 commitment:\n\n- \u25a0 Halve our use of virgin plastic, by reducing our absolute use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes and accelerating our use of recycled plastic.\n- \u25a0 Help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell.\n\nWe also restated our commitment to use at least 25% recycled plastic in our packaging by 2025.\n\n## Managing plastic risks and opportunities\n\n## Changing consumer preferences\n\nRisks and opportunities: There has been a significant rise in consumer concern regarding plastic packaging over the last few years. Concern is not universal and takes on different dimensions in different countries depending on the media coverage and government focus. A recent study by GlobeScan found that single-use plastic is a 'very serious' concern for over half of consumers surveyed, behind climate change, natural resource depletion and air pollution, while a Kantar and GfK study found plastic waste as a top environmental concern after climate change. As a result of Covid-19, we see a number of consumer behaviour shifts that we believe will remain for the mid to long term, including increased demand for 'at home' solutions and rapid growth in eCommerce. The shift to eCommerce platforms in particular presents opportunities to use different formats and new business models such as reuseable and refillable packaging that support the delivery of our virgin reduction commitment.\n\nActions we're taking: We're transforming our approach to plastic packaging through our 'Less plastic, Better plastic, No plastic.' framework. 'Less plastic' is about cutting down how much we use in the first place. 'Better plastic' is about making our products recyclable and eliminating problematic materials. Specifically, it's about how we get recycled content into our packaging. And 'No plastic' is about thinking differently - using alternative materials such as aluminium, glass, paper and board where appropriate and removing plastic where it is not necessary.\n\nWe know consumers expect us, first and foremost, to reduce our reliance on plastic packaging. We have committed to reduce our use of virgin plastic in our packaging by 50% by 2025, this equates to no more than 350,000 tonnes. We plan to deliver this firstly by eliminating over 100,000 tonnes of plastic from our packaging by accelerating multiple-use packs and reusable, refillable, and no plastic product innovations. We will deliver the remainder by increasing our use of recycled materials, by giving plastic a value to ensure it can be collected and processed (see policy and regulatory risks below).\n\nOur use of recycled plastic has increased significantly. Our commitment has driven a step change in our sourcing and how we integrate recycled plastic in our packaging. We estimate we will end the year with 15% of our total plastic packaging footprint consisting of recycled plastic. Dove has introduced 100% recycled plastic bottles in North America and Europe across all ranges. Magnum has rolled out of more than 7 million ice cream tubs made from recycled plastic after a successful pilot. This is a big technical achievement as the plastic not only needs to be food grade, but also withstand freezing temperatures.\n\nWe're exploring new ways of packaging and delivering products - including refill at home concentrated formats such as our Cif ecorefill which eliminates 75% of plastic and is now available",

        "page_content": "across Europe, Canada and Australia; and Omo Concentrate, our first dilute at home laundry detergent which is available in several South American markets. It was launched in Brazil in 2019 and has seen great success, shifting 30% of Omo 3 litre consumers in Brazil to the refill at home format.\n\nFinally, we continue to experiment with refills to eliminate the need for plastic. In the UK, we have partnered with Asda to launch our largest in-store refill pilot in Europe. And in Chile we have partnered with Algramo, a social enterprise, to deliver refills directly to consumers at home. This intelligent dispensing system has thrived during Covid-19 thanks to its tricycle distribution system across Santiago. We are also experimenting with new formats that use alternative materials or have no packaging at all. We have already brought to the market innovations including bamboo toothbrushes (Signal), recyclable glass bottles (Knorr) and paper ice cream tubs (Carte D'Or). Seventh Generation has also launched a zero-plastic range on eCommerce channels in the US, using packaging made from steel. We now have dedicated teams looking at scaling new business models on reusable, refillable formats and we're investing in pilot programmes all over the world to test their viability.\n\n## Policy and regulatory risks\n\nRisks and opportunities: There is a growing focus from governments on plastic and the potential for further regulatory and tax measures in a number of markets where we operate. In the EU for example, member countries have agreed to the Plastics Strategy set out by the European Commission, which requires that all plastic waste will be recyclable by 2030. Policy developments in the area of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) are also more common. We are supportive of well-designed EPR regulations which reflect the unique waste management requirements in that country. We believe well-designed EPR schemes can be a game-changer in the fight against plastic waste. They boost recycling systems, ensure money is invested in the right places, hold businesses to account for the packaging choices they make, and as a result, enable a circular economy. In developing markets, we are working with governments and other stakeholders to support the development of collection and reprocessing infrastructure before a formal EPR system is designed and adopted. We also support the implementation of comprehensive waste management legislation to build a more effective and efficient waste infrastructure.\n\nActions we're taking: Improving waste infrastructure is key to us reaching our 100% recyclable goal and ensuring availability of recycled plastic. To stimulate recycling in our markets, we introduced a new target in 2019 to help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025. This requires us to help collect and process around 690,000 tonnes of plastic annually by 2025. We continue to work with many partners to help collect and process plastic packaging, with programmes in multiple countries, including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, UK and US. This includes direct investments and partnerships in waste collection and processing, buying recycled plastics, and through supporting well-designed EPR schemes in which Unilever directly pays for the collection of its packaging.\n\nIn India, for example, we're working with the United Nations Development Programme to protect the livelihoods of informal waste collectors, who help segregate, collect and recycle packaging. The partnership has reached more than 33,000 households and collected 2,500 tonnes of plastic waste so far, and will scale up to include more households in the coming\n\nyears. In Indonesia, we have supported communities in 18 cities to develop systems where they can collect and sell waste. We're using a platform called 'Google My Business', which enables consumers to access the locations of nearby waste banks via Google Maps. Currently, around 780 waste banks are searchable on the digital tool, and the aim is to make 2,000 waste banks available through Google Maps. Together with other companies, we collectively pledged a total of US$100 million in funding to Circulate Capital, an investment firm that incubates and finances waste management solutions and infrastructure. It's a unique investment model, designed to create the lasting systems change needed to address the ocean plastic crisis. This year Circulate Capital announced inaugural investments in two companies in India and Indonesia that recycle local plastic waste into useful products. Across all our plastic targets, we need to continue our advocacy, partnerships and policy approach to drive system-wide change and shift the economy from a finite and linear - take, make, dispose - model to a circular approach that protects the environment and protects our resources whilst supporting a growing population. For example, it is important that we unlock regulatory barriers for PCR use. It is also imperative that there is a favourable policy environment to support sustainable financing for collection as well as financial incentives for the right behaviours.\n\n## Human rights risks\n\nRisks and opportunities: We are aware that there are potential human rights issues in emerging markets which do not have formalised waste management infrastructure. Informal waste collection (waste pickers) and recycling is a common way to earn an income and a livelihood.\n\nActions we're taking: Our Responsible Sourcing Policy contains clear guidance on 12 fundamental principles such as the protection of workers' health and safety, employing a permitted workforce (age/freedom of movement) and fair wages. We have refused to work with waste management companies based on a lack of assurances on human rights, child labour and working conditions. We are developing a global framework on how we approach and include human rights in our plastic value chain, especially for informal waste collectors who are involved in collection and processing in a number of developing markets.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nFor the reporting period July 2019 to June 2020, as a result of our ongoing efforts to improve our data coverage, we now have accurate data for around 80% of the sales volume in scope for plastic packaging reporting. Based on this, our total plastic packaging footprint is 690,000 tonnes, of which 52% was reusable, recyclable or compostable, in practice and at scale (i.e. actual recyclability). We continue to make progress on technical recyclability (i.e. packaging designed for recycling but not yet recycled at scale). As recycling infrastructure improves across the markets we operate in, we expect an increase in our actual recyclability which will close the gap on what is technically recyclable. We are helping to stimulate investment through our collection and processing target. Approximately 11% (76,000 tonnes) of our total plastic packaging footprint consisted of recycled plastic - a significant increase compared to last year and strong progress towards our goal to use at least 25% recycled plastic by 2025.",

In the short term, our progress to reduce our virgin plastic footprint will be driven primarily by our PCR use. However, we are working towards an absolute reduction by accelerating and scaling our less, better or no plastic innovations.\n\nWe are implementing a robust measurement approach to track collection and processing.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance\n\n## Unilever's structure\n\nIn 2020, Unilever changed its legal structure by unifying under a single parent company, PLC. For the first time in its history, Unilever now trades with one market capitalisation, one class of shares and one global pool of liquidity, whilst also maintaining the Unilever Group's listings on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nThe Board believes that Unification will bring significant benefits by increasing Unilever's strategic flexibility for portfolio evolution, including through equity-based acquisitions or demergers and removing complexity and further strengthening Unilever's corporate governance, creating for the first time an equal voting basis per share for all shareholders.\n\nSince its formation in 1930 until 29 November 2020, the Unilever Group operated under a dual-headed legal structure with two parent companies: Unilever N.V. (NV), which was incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and PLC, incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. During that time, PLC and NV, together with their group companies, operated as nearly as practicable as a single economic entity, which was achieved by special provisions in their articles of association and a series of agreements between PLC and NV known as the Foundation Agreements. Each PLC share represented the same underlying economic interest in the Unilever Group as each NV share. As a result, parity between the economic rights of the respective shareholders of PLC and NV was maintained. However, PLC and NV were separate legal entities with different shareholder constituencies and separate stock exchange listings. Shareholders were not able to convert or exchange the shares of one company for the shares of the other.\n\nOver the last two decades, the dual-parent holding company structure of the Unilever Group was reviewed periodically and a series of steps were taken to reduce complexity, including in October 2017 when NV's preference shares were successfully repurchased, and in June 2019 when NV terminated its depositary receipt structure.\n\nOn 29 November 2020, after receiving overwhelming support in favour of the proposals at shareholders' meetings of both NV and PLC held in September 2020 and October 2020 respectively, the Unilever Group completed the Unification of its dual-parent legal structure. Pursuant to the cross-border merger: (i) PLC acquired all of the assets, liabilities and legal relationships of NV by universal succession of title; (ii) NV was dissolved without going into liquidation and ceased to exist; and (iii) PLC issued and allotted shares in its capital to former NV shareholders.\n\nUnder the terms of Unification, all of the NV ordinary shares were cancelled and NV shareholders received one new PLC ordinary share of 3 1/9 pence in exchange for each NV share owned, consistent with the oneto-one equalisation ratio that was set out in the Equalisation Agreement, and can continue to trade their new shares on Euronext in Amsterdam in Euros. NV New York Registry Shares were converted one-for-one to new PLC American Depositary Shares or new PLC ordinary shares. A very small number of NV shareholders elected to receive cash instead of new PLC shares pursuant to a Dutch statutory withdrawal mechanism. Unification resulted in the issue and allotment of 1,460,713,122 new PLC ordinary shares pursuant to the authority granted to the PLC Directors at the PLC shareholders' meeting held in October 2020. As at 29 November 2020, the new PLC shares represented 55.56% of the total number of PLC shares. As at 31 December 2020, PLC's total issued ordinary share capital consisted of 2,629,243,772 ordinary shares.\n\nAll of the 2,400 NV special ordinary shares and 100,000 PLC deferred shares, which ensured the unity of management of NV and PLC, were repurchased by NV and PLC respectively immediately prior to the implementation of Unification and cancelled.\n\nFollowing the implementation of Unification, PLC is now the single parent company of the Unilever Group. PLC's shares are traded through its listings on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext in Amsterdam, with its securities also traded on the New York Stock Exchange under its American Depositary Share programme.\n\nUnification did not change our Board composition or governance framework, and the Board delegates a number of its authorities as described below, including to our four Board Committees. The Board of PLC has implemented standards of corporate governance and disclosure policies applicable to a UK incorporated company, with listings in London, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nUnilever's presence in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and our multi-stakeholder approach to business remain unchanged as a result of Unification.\n\n## Articles of association\n\nAt the 2010 PLC AGM, the shareholders agreed that the objects clause be removed from PLC's Articles of Association so that there are no restrictions on its objects.\n\nThe current Articles of Association were approved by shareholders in October 2020 and adopted with effect from 29 November 2020.\n\n## Allocation of profits\n\nDistributable profits of PLC are paid first at the rate of 5% per year on the paid-up nominal capital of 3 1/9 pence of the ordinary shares and secondly at a rate of 5% per year on the paid-up nominal capital of 3 1/9 pence of the ordinary shares. The surplus is paid by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares.\n\n## Lapse of distributions\n\nAny PLC dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date of the declaration of the dividend by PLC reverts to PLC.\n\nThe time periods for the right to claim cash dividends or the proceeds of share distributions declared by Unilever NV before Unification will remain at 5 and 20 years, respectively, after the first day the dividend or share distribution was obtainable from Unilever NV. Any such unclaimed amounts will now revert to Unilever PLC after the expiry of these time periods.\n\n## Redemption provisions and capital call\n\nOutstanding PLC ordinary shares cannot be redeemed. PLC may make capital calls on money unpaid on shares and not payable on a fixed date. PLC has only fully paid shares in issue.\n\n## Modification of rights\n\nModifications to PLC's Articles of Association must be approved by a general meeting of shareholders.\n\nModifications that prejudicially affect the rights and privileges of a class of PLC shareholders require the written consent of three-quarters of the affected holders (excluding treasury shares) or a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the class at which at least two persons holding or representing at least one third of the paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) must be present. Every shareholder is entitled to one vote per share held on a poll and may demand a poll vote. At any adjourned general meeting, present affected class holders may establish a quorum.\n\n## Indemnification\n\nThe power to indemnify PLC Directors is provided for in PLC's Articles of Association and deeds of indemnity have been agreed with all PLC Directors. Third-party directors' and officers' liability insurance was in place for all Unilever Directors throughout 2020 and is currently in force.\n\nIn addition, PLC provides indemnities (including, where applicable, a qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision) to the Directors of three subsidiaries each of which acts, or acted as trustee of a Unilever UK pension fund. Appropriate trustee liability insurance is also in place.",

        "page_content": "## The Governance of Unilever\n\nA comprehensive description of Unilever's corporate governance arrangements, including further details on the structure of the Unilever Group, is set out in 'The Governance of Unilever'. It further details the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman, Senior Independent Director (SID), CEO, CFO and other corporate officers and how our Board effectively operates, governs itself and delegates its authorities.\n\nThe Governance of Unilever also describes Directors' appointment, tenure, induction and training, Directors' ability to seek independent advice at Unilever's expense and details about Board and Management Committees (including the Disclosure Committee).\n\n- www.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm-and-corporategovernance/our-corporate-governance\n\n## Board\n\nThe Board of PLC has ultimate responsibility for the management, general affairs, direction, culture, performance and long-term success of our business as a whole. The majority of the Directors are Non-Executive Directors who essentially have a supervisory role, providing constructive challenges, strategic guidance and specialist advice. In the normal course Unilever has two Executive Directors, the CEO and the CFO. A list of our current Directors can be found on pages 64 and 65.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established four Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The terms of reference of these Committees can be found on our website and the reports of each Committee, including attendance at meetings in 2020, can be found on pages 70 to 103.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.unilever.com/boardsofunilever\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn the ordinary course six Board meetings are planned throughout the calendar year to consider important corporate events and actions, for example, the half-year and full-year results announcements; the development and approval of our strategy; oversight of the performance of the business; review of the risk framework; authorisation of major transactions; declaration of dividends; review of the financial plan; succession planning; review of the functioning of the Board and its Committees; culture; workforce engagement; and review of corporate responsibility. Other ad hoc Board meetings are convened to discuss strategic, transactional and governance matters that arise. A majority of Board meetings will be held in the UK.\n\nIn 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board met physically in January only. The Board then held all remaining meetings virtually in 2020, these being in March, April, May, June, July, October and November. The Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the Unilever Group. The Chairman sets the Board's agenda, ensures the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, promotes and facilitates constructive relationships and effective contribution of all the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and promotes a culture of openness and debate.\n\nWhen there is a Board meeting, the Non-Executive Directors usually meet also as a group, without the Executive Directors present. In 2020 they met six times. The Chairman, or in his absence the SID, chairs such meetings.\n\nThe table showing the attendance of current Directors at Board meetings in 2020 can be found on page 65. If Directors are unable to attend a Board meeting they have the opportunity beforehand to discuss any agenda items with the Chairman.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nEach year the Board formally assesses its own performance, including with respect to its composition, diversity and how effectively its members work together, with the aim of helping to improve the effectiveness of both the Board and the Committees. At least once every three years an independent third-party facilitates the evaluation. The last external evaluation was performed at the end of 2019 by No.4, an independent third-party consultant, and consisted of individual interviews with the Directors followed by a Board discussion in January 2020, covering both the outcome of the evaluation and the proposed actions to enhance the effectiveness of the Board.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Board performed an internal evaluation which consisted of the Directors completing a questionnaire that focused on a number of key areas including strategy, risk/financial controls, Board effectiveness, virtual ways of working, and information/knowledge. The Chairman's statement on page 5 describes the key actions agreed by the Board following the internal evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation of the performance of the Chairman and CEO is led by the SID and Chairman respectively, and bespoke questionnaires are used to support these evaluations.\n\nCommittees of the Board evaluate themselves annually under supervision of their respective Chairs taking into account the views of respective Committee members and the Board. The key actions agreed by each Committee in the 2020 evaluations can be found in each Committee Report.\n\n## Board appointment\n\nThe report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) on pages 74 and 75 describes the work of the NCGC in Board appointments and recommendations for re-election. In addition, shareholders are able to nominate Directors for appointment. The procedure for shareholders to nominate Directors is contained within the document entitled 'Appointment procedure for PLC Directors' which is available on our website. To do so they must put a resolution to the PLC AGM in line with English law requirements. Directors are appointed by shareholders by a simple majority vote at the AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.unilever.com/boardsofunilever\n\n## Board induction and training\n\nAll new Directors participate in a comprehensive induction programme when they join the Board. The Chairman ensures that ongoing training is provided for Directors by way of site visits, presentations and circulated updates at (and between) Board and Board Committee meetings on, among other things, Unilever's business, environmental, social, corporate governance, regulatory developments and investor relations matters. For example, in 2020 the Directors received presentations on shareholder activism and cyber security, and held a session with the Unilever Sustainability Advisory Council.\n\n## Independence and conflicts\n\nIt is important that the Non-Executive Directors can be considered to be independent. Each year the Board conducts a thorough review of the Non-Executive Directors', and their related or connected persons', relevant relationships referencing the criteria set out in The Governance of Unilever which is derived from the relevant best practice guidelines in the UK and US. The Board currently considers all our Non- Executive Directors to be independent of Unilever.\n\nWe attach special importance to avoiding conflicts of interest between PLC and its Directors. The Board ensures that there are effective procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest by Board members. A Director must without delay report any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the Chairman and to the other Directors, or, in case any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest of the Chairman, to the SID and to the other Directors. The Director in question must provide all relevant information to the Board, so that the Board can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant laws. A Director may not take part in the decision-taking process of the Board in respect of any situation in which he or she has a conflict of interest. We consider the procedures that Unilever has put in place to deal with conflicts of interest operate effectively.",

        "page_content": "Unilever recognises the benefit to the individual and the Unilever Group of senior executives acting as directors of other companies but, to ensure outside directorships of our Executive Directors do not involve an excessive commitment or conflict of interest, the number of outside directorships of listed companies is generally limited to one per Executive Director and approval is required from the Chairman.\n\nUnilever, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, assesses and monitors the structure of the Board including the other directorships held or proposed to be held by Non-Executive Directors. Unilever aims to have a Board with a diverse range of skills and capabilities and works to the principle that each Director shall have sufficient time available for the performance of his or her duties. Unilever considers that the other board responsibilities of its Non-Executive Directors, including those taken on during 2020, are fully consistent with these aims.\n\n## Engagement with employees\n\nGiven Unilever's global footprint and scope of operations, the Board decided that the most effective way of organising its engagement with employees was to share the responsibility among all Non-Executive Directors as a collective point of contact. The Board has therefore endorsed a number of initiatives and events, including face-to-face meetings to ensure that all the Non-Executive Directors engage with the workforce and get a sense of employee sentiment at all levels. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic we have been required to hold these face-toface meetings virtually and have incorporated additional engagement sessions alongside virtual Board meetings and the virtual Board visits to Unilever sites that we have undertaken this year. These engagement sessions have enabled all Non-Executive Directors to meet and hear directly from cohorts of employees at all levels how they feel about issues important to them through open discussion.\n\nIn 2020, Non-Executive Directors attended 12 virtual workforce engagement events with a diverse range of the workforce; from factory staff and new joiners through to head office staff and people with 25+ years in the company. This method of engagement allowed for discussions covering a wide range of topics.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic affected the way our employees worked in 2020, and our Non-Executive Directors engaged on a number of topics related to this, such as how our factory workers at two factories in the UAE experienced working during the pandemic. They also listened to the experiences of employees who were at the centre of responding to the pandemic in Italy. The Non-Executive Directors were also given the opportunity to hear from employees in the US, Russia, India and Sweden on how they had found working from home during the lockdown, from employees about how the local Thriving Parents programme has assisted working parents during lockdown, from employees located at HIVE, the new Dutch Foods innovation centre which opened in December 2019, about how the way we innovate in Foods is changing, and from employees in Denmark and Austria about preparing to return to the office. In addition, Non-Executive Directors listened to employees who had been redeployed during the pandemic at our Raeford factory in the US and Maydon Wharf Factory in South Africa, and also how our colleagues in Argentina had experienced their ways of working changing in order to react to market shifts as a result of Covid-19. Lastly, NonExecutive Directors also heard from employees of Unilever International and the Prestige business.\n\nThe events have been a success with positive feedback from employees and Non-Executive Directors alike. Our Non-Executive Directors were able to engage, hear and share views with employees on a host of new topics which was particularly helpful in a year when many new normals were being established. This perspective has been taken into consideration in decision making, for example improving UK employee onboarding processes and reviewing and amending annual leave policies for front line factory staff.",

As announced by PLC on 30 November 2020, following the completion of Unification, 1,460,713,122 new PLC shares were issued under these authorities which represent 55.56% of the total number of PLC shares. Since the 2020 PLC AGM, no shares have been issued under the 2020 PLC AGM authorities. To the extent that they are unused, each of those authorities expire on the earlier of the conclusion of PLC's 2021 AGM and 30 June 2021. Renewal of these authorities is sought each year. In connection with Unification, PLC purchased and cancelled 100,000 deferred shares of \u00a31.00 each, which ensured the unity of management of NV and PLC prior to Unification, from N.V. Elma and United Holdings Limited, members of the Group, for an aggregate amount of \u00a3100,000. The deferred shares represented 0.27% of the issued share capital of PLC prior to Unification.\n\nDuring 2020, companies within the Unilever Group did not purchase any PLC ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares.\n\n## Trust Office\n\nOn 26 June 2019, the meeting of depositary receipt holders resolved to terminate the former NV depositary receipt structure with effect from 28 June 2019. As a result, holders of depositary receipts automatically received one NV ordinary share for every depositary receipt they owned. In addition, the trading line of depositary receipts on Euronext Amsterdam was terminated and all trading continued in NV ordinary shares. On implementation of Unification, the remaining NV ordinary shares held by the Trust Office were cancelled and new PLC ordinary shares were issued to the Trust Office on a one-for-one basis.\n\nThe Trust Office will not be dissolved until 27 June 2021 as a limited number of depositary receipts are outstanding in respect of which the bearer certificates issued by N.V. Nederlandsch Administratie- en Trustkantoor, the predecessor of the Trust Office, have not been handed in and have not been exchanged for PLC ordinary shares. Thereafter, it is expected that the Trust Office shall sell the PLC ordinary shares that have not been exchanged and the proceeds will be given in consignment to the Dutch Ministry of Finance. Holders of bearer certificates have thereafter no claim whatsoever towards the Trust Office.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.administratiekantoor-unilever.nl/eng/home\n\n## Our shareholders\n\n## Significant shareholders of PLC\n\nAs far as Unilever is aware, the only holder of more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable to, PLC's ordinary share capital ('Disclosable Interests') on 31 December 2020, was BlackRock with a shareholding of 6.40% and voting interest of 6.18%.\n\nAs far as Unilever is aware, no new Disclosable Interests have been notified to PLC between 1 January 2021 and 23 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report). Between 1 January 2018 and 23 February 2021, (i) BlackRock, and (ii) the aggregated holdings of the trustees of the Leverhulme Trust and the Leverhulme Trade Charities Trust, have held more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable to, PLC's ordinary shares.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nWe value open and effective communication with our shareholders.\n\nThe CFO has lead responsibility for shareholder engagement, with the active involvement of the CEO and supported by the Investor Relations department.\n\nIn 2020, meetings were held with institutional shareholders based across the world. Members of the ULE and Investor Relations team also met a large number of investors at industry conferences. From March 2020, all engagement was carried out virtually, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Chairman, CEO and CFO also engaged with investors on the proposals to unify the Unilever Group's legal structure under a single parent company.\n\nThe Chair of the Compensation Committee extensively engaged with and sought feedback from investors in relation to our Directors' Remuneration Policy which is up for renewal at the 2021 PLC AGM. Further details can be found on pages 76 to 78 of the Directors' Remuneration Report. On an ongoing basis, the Board is briefed on investor reactions to the Unilever Group's quarterly results announcements and on any issues raised by shareholders that are relevant to their responsibilities.\n\nWe maintain a frequent dialogue with our principal institutional shareholders and regularly collect feedback. Private shareholders are encouraged to give feedback via shareholder.services@unilever.com. Our shareholders are also welcome to raise any issues directly with the Chairman or the SID, and the Chairman, Executive Directors and Chairs of the Committees are also generally available to answer questions from the shareholders at the AGM each year. More information on shareholder engagement can be found on pages 15 and 77.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.unilever.com/investor-relations/\n\n## General meetings\n\nAt the PLC AGM the Chairman gives his thoughts on governance aspects of the preceding year and the CEO gives a detailed review of the performance of the Unilever Group over the last year. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the meeting and to ask questions at or in advance of the meeting. Indeed, the question and answer session forms an important part of each meeting. The external auditors are welcomed to the AGM and are entitled to address the meeting on any part of the business of the meeting which concerns them as auditors.\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the UK government's 'Stay at Home' measures, the 2020 PLC AGM was held as a closed meeting and shareholders were unable to attend the meeting in person. However, recognising that the AGM also serves as a forum for shareholders to engage with Directors, following the conclusion of the PLC AGM, a live webcast was held on Unilever's corporate website with statements by the Chairman and CEO before responding to questions submitted by shareholders prior to the meeting and follow-up questions raised at the meeting.\n\nIn addition, following the passing of emergency legislation in the Netherlands and the UK relating to the holding of shareholder meetings in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the NV AGM and the NV and PLC shareholders' meetings to approve Unification were each held electronically. A live webcast of these meetings was held on Unilever's corporate website with statements by the Chairman and CEO before responding to any questions submitted by shareholders prior to the meetings and follow-up questions raised at the meeting.\n\nShareholders of PLC may propose resolutions if they individually or together hold shares representing at least 5% of the total voting rights",

Unless expressly specified to the contrary in PLC's Articles of Association, PLC's Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution. The Articles of Association of PLC can be found on our website.\n\n- www.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm-and-corporategovernance/our-corporate-governance/\n\n## Right to hold and transfer shares\n\nUnilever's constitutional documents place no limitations on the right to hold or transfer PLC ordinary shares. There are no limitations on the right to hold or exercise voting rights on the ordinary shares of PLC imposed by English law.\n\n## Corporate governance compliance\n\nWe conduct our operations in accordance with internationally accepted principles of good governance and best practice, while ensuring compliance with the corporate governance requirements applicable in the countries in which we operate. Unilever is subject to corporate governance requirements (legislation, codes and/or standards) in the UK and the US and in this section we report on our compliance against these.\n\n## The United Kingdom\n\nIn 2020, PLC has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further information on how Unilever has applied the five overarching categories of Principles can be found on the following pages - (i) Board Leadership and Company Purpose: pages 1, 8 and 61 to 63, (ii) Division of Responsibilities: pages 62 and 70 to 78, (iii) Composition, Succession and Evaluation: pages 5, 62, 74 and 75, (iv) Audit, Risk and Internal Control: pages 44 to 60, 70, 71 and 104; and (v) Remuneration: pages 76 to103. The UK Code is available on the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) website.\n\nRisk Management and Control: Our approach to risk management and systems of internal control is in line with the recommendations in the FRC's revised guidance 'Risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting' (the Risk Guidance). It is Unilever's practice to review acquired companies' governance procedures and to align them to the Unilever Group's governance procedures as soon as is practicable.\n\nUnder the European Takeover Directive as implemented in the UK, the UK Companies Act 2006 and rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Unilever is required to provide information on contracts and other arrangements essential or material to the business of the Unilever Group. We believe we do not have any such contracts or arrangements.\n\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: Information on GHG emissions can be found on page 56.\n\nEmployee Involvement and Communication: Unilever's UK companies maintain formal processes to inform, consult and involve employees and their representatives. A National Consultative Forum comprising employees and management representatives from key locations meets regularly to discuss issues relating to Unilever sites in the United Kingdom. We recognise collective bargaining on a number of sites and engage with employees via the Sourcing Unit Forum, which includes national officer representation from the three recognised trade unions.\n\nA European Works Council, embracing employee and management representatives from countries within Europe, has been in existence for several years and provides a forum for discussing issues that extend across national boundaries. Further details on how the Board has engaged with the workforce can be found on page 63.\n\nEqual Opportunities and Diversity: Consistent with our Code of Business Principles, Unilever aims to ensure that applications for employment from everyone are given full and fair consideration and that everyone is given access to training, development and career opportunities. Every effort is made to reskill and support employees who become disabled while working within the Group.\n\n## The United States\n\nPLC is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As such, PLC must comply with the requirements of US legislation, regulations enacted under US securities laws and the Listing Standards of the NYSE, that are applicable to foreign private issuers, copies of which are available on their websites.\n\nWe are substantially compliant with the Listing Standards of the NYSE applicable to foreign private issuers except as set out below.\n\nWe are required to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those typically followed by US companies listed on the NYSE. Our corporate governance practices are primarily based on the requirements of the UK Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on the NYSE. The only significant way in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by domestic companies under Section 303A Corporate Governance Standards of the NYSE is that the NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions thereto, with certain limited exemptions. The UK Listing Rules require shareholder approval of equity compensation plans only if new or treasury shares are issued for the purpose of satisfying obligations under the plan or if the plan is a long-term incentive plan in which a director may participate. Amendments to plans approved by shareholders generally only require approval if they are to the advantage of the plan participants.\n\nAttention is drawn to the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 70 and 71. In addition, further details about our corporate governance are provided in the document entitled 'The Governance of Unilever' which can be found on our website.\n\nAll senior executives and senior financial officers have declared their understanding of and compliance with Unilever's Code of Business Principles and the related Code Policies. No waiver from any provision of the Code of Business Principles or Code Policies was granted in 2020 to any of the persons falling within the scope of the SEC requirements. The Code of Business Principles and related Code Policies are published on our website.\n\nRisk Management and Control: Following a review by the Disclosure Committee, Audit Committee and Board, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the design and operation of the Unilever Group's disclosure controls and procedures, including those defined in the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - Rule 13a - 15(e), as at 31 December 2020 were effective.\n\nUnilever is required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This requirement is reported on within the section entitled 'Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting' on page 201.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.unilever.com/corporategovernance",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\nThe Audit Committee is comprised only of independent Non-Executive Directors with a minimum requirement of three such members. It is chaired by John Rishton and the other current members are Judith Hartmann and Susan Kilsby. For the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, John Rishton is the Audit Committee's financial expert. The Board is satisfied that the members of the Audit Committee are competent in financial matters and have recent and relevant experience. Other attendees at Committee meetings were the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Auditor, EVP Financial Control, Risk Management, Pensions & Sustainability, Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary and the external auditors. Throughout the year the Committee members periodically met without others present and also held separate private sessions with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Auditor and the external auditors, allowing the Committee to discuss issues in more detail. Since April, due to the pandemic all meetings have been held virtually.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in written terms of reference which are reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account relevant legislation and recommended good practice. The terms of reference are contained within 'The Governance of Unilever' which is available on our website at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.unilever.com/corporategovernance\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following matters:\n\n- \u25a0 oversight of the integrity of Unilever's financial statements;\n- \u25a0 review of Unilever's half yearly and annual financial statements (including clarity and completeness of disclosure) and approval of the quarterly trading statements for quarter 1 and quarter 3;\n- \u25a0 oversight of risk management and internal control arrangements;\n- \u25a0 oversight of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n- \u25a0 oversight of the external auditors' performance, objectivity, qualifications and independence; the approval process of non audit services; recommendation to the Board of the nomination of the external auditors for shareholder approval; and approval of their fees, refer to note 24 on page 166.\n- \u25a0 performance of the internal audit function; and\n- \u25a0 approval of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) expense policy and the review of Executive Director expenses.\n\nAll relevant matters arising are brought to the attention of the Board.\n\nIn order to help the Committee meet its oversight responsibilities, each year management organise knowledge sessions for the Committee on subject areas within its remit. In 2020, sessions were held with management on cyber security, data privacy and the activities of our global business services function. Given the Covid-19 crisis the Committee also had presentations from management and discussions on: the implications of the pandemic on the businesses risk management activities; the preparation of the financial statements; the overall control environment; and the operation of the financial reporting controls.\n\n## How the Committee has discharged its responsibilities\n\nDuring the year, the Committee's principal activities were as follows:\n\n## Financial Statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed prior to publication the quarterly financial press releases together with the associated internal quarterly reports from the Chief Financial Officer and the Disclosure Committee and, with respect\n\nto the full-year results, the external auditor's report. It also reviewed this Annual Report and Accounts and the Annual Report on Form 20-F 2020. These reviews incorporated the accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates underpinning the financial statements as disclosed within note 1 on pages 116 to 118. Particular attention was paid to the following significant issues in relation to the financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 indirect tax provisions and contingent liabilities, refer to note 19 and 20 on page 160 and 161;\n- \u25a0 direct tax provisions, refer to note 6 on pages 131 to 133;\n- \u25a0 revenue recognition - including discounts and incentives;\n- \u25a0 acquisition of Horlicks, refer to note 21 on pages 162 to 165; and\n- \u25a0 Unification, refer to note 1 on page 116.\n\nThese matters are also highlighted by our external auditors as being important in their audit.\n\nFor each of the above areas the Committee considered the key facts and judgements outlined by management. Members of management attended the section of the meeting of the Committee where their item was discussed to answer any questions or challenges posed by the Committee. The issues were also discussed with the external auditors and further information can be found on pages 105 to 111. The Committee specifically discussed with the external auditor how management's judgement and assertions were challenged and how professional scepticism was demonstrated during their audit of these areas; this included the disclosures for each matter noted above and where relevant challenging the sensitivity analysis performed by the external auditor. The Committee is satisfied that there are relevant accounting policies in place in relation to these significant issues and management have correctly applied these policies.\n\nIn addition to the matters noted above, our external auditors, as required by auditing standards, also consider the risk of management override of controls. Nothing has come to our attention or their attention to suggest any material misstatement with respect to suspected or actual fraud relating to management override of controls.\n\nAt the request of the Board the Committee undertook to:\n\n- \u25a0 review the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements;\n- \u25a0 assess whether the business was viable in accordance with the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The assessment included a review of the principal risks facing Unilever, their potential impact, how they were being managed, together with a discussion as to the appropriate period for the assessment. The Committee recommended to the Board that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period (consistent with the period of the strategic plan) of the assessment; and\n- \u25a0 consider whether the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2020 was fair, balanced and understandable and whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy. The Committee also reviewed the processes and controls that are the basis for its preparation. The Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2020 is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nIn terms of regulatory reviews during the year, on 12 March 2020 we received confirmation from the Dutch regulator (AFM) that they were satisfied with our responses and enhancements to certain disclosures in our annual reports and accounts, as a result of their review of our 2018 annual report and accounts. On 30 November 2020 we received a letter from the UK regulator (FRC) with respect to their thematic review of the climate disclosures in the 2019 annual report and accounts. They had no questions, just a couple of observations and no response was required. In March 2020 the FRC and the SEC issued general guidance for companies given the Covid-19 crisis. This has been reviewed and taken into consideration in preparing the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Risk management and internal control arrangements\n\nThe Committee reviewed Unilever's overall approach to risk management and control, and its processes, outcomes and disclosure. The assessment was undertaken through a review of:\n\n- \u25a0 the yearly report detailing the risk identification and assessment process, together with new significant risks and any emerging risks identified by management;\n- \u25a0 reports from senior management on those 2020 corporate risks for which the Audit Committee had oversight responsibility: treasury, tax and",

        "page_content": "pensions, information security, legal and regulatory compliance and business transformation;\n\n- \u25a0 the proposed 2021 corporate risks identified by the ULE;\n- \u25a0 the Controller's Quarterly Risk and Control Status Reports, including Code of Business Principles cases relating to frauds and financial crimes and significant issues received through the Unilever Code Support Line;\n- \u25a0 a summary of control deficiencies identified through controls testing activities together with action plans to address underlying causes;\n- \u25a0 management's improvements to reporting through further automation and centralisation; and\n- \u25a0 the annual financial plan and Unilever's dividend policy and dividend proposals.\n\nEach of these reports included any impacts or implications of Covid-19. The impact of Covid-19 on the businesses principal risks is outlined on page 46. Whilst most office based employees have been working remotely during the pandemic this has not impacted the reporting process or the timetable. The only change has been an increased use in collaboration tools. A review of the financial controls concluded that, except for a limited number of changes with respect to the physical verification of fixed assets and inventory the ongoing operation of the financial controls have substantially been unaffected by Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the application of the requirements under Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control, the Committee met regularly with senior members of management and is satisfied with the key judgements taken.\n\nThe Committee has completed its review for 2020 on both risk management and internal control and was satisfied that the process had worked effectively and where specific areas for improvement were identified, there was adequate mitigating or alternative controls and that processes were underway to ensure sustainable improvements. The key area for focus going forward is ensuring that controls impacted by the significant change programmes are appropriately designed and operated before those programmes are started.\n\nDuring 2020 the Committee also continued its oversight of the independent assurance work that is performed on a number of our USLP metrics (selected on the basis of their materiality to the USLP).\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe Committee reviewed internal audit's plan for the year which is focused on Unilever's corporate risks, and agreed its budget and resource requirements. The pandemic impacted the way the audits have been completed since April 2020. All work has been done remotely and there has been more focus on data analysis and the use of remote video technology. The Committee reviewed interim and year-end summary reports and management's response together with the completion status of agreed actions.\n\nEvery five years, the Committee engages an independent third party to perform an effectiveness review of the function. This was last completed in 2018. In 2020 the Committee evaluated the performance of the internal audit function through a questionnaire. The feedback was reviewed and the Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the internal audit function. During the year, the Committee also met independently with the Chief Auditor and discussed the results of the audits performed and any additional insights obtained from the Chief Auditor.\n\n## Audit of the annual accounts\n\nKPMG, Unilever's external auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, reported in depth to the Committee on the scope and outcome of the annual audit, including their audit of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Their reports included audit and accounting matters, governance and control, and accounting developments.\n\nThe Committee held independent meetings with the external auditors during the year and reviewed, agreed, discussed and challenged their audit plan, including the materiality applied, scope and assessment of the financial reporting risk profile of the Group.\n\nThe Committee discussed the views and conclusions of KPMG regarding management's treatment of significant transactions and areas of judgement during the year. The Committee considered these views and comments and is satisfied with the treatment in the financial statements.\n\n## External auditors\n\nKPMG have been the Group's auditors since 2014 and shareholders approved their reappointment as the Group's external auditors at the\n\n2020 AGMs. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Directors will be proposing the reappointment of KPMG at the AGM in May 2021.\n\nThe Committee confirms that the Group is in compliance with The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which requires Unilever to tender the audit every 10 years. The last tender for the audit of the Annual Report and Accounts was performed in 2013 with respect to the audit for the financial year ending 2014. At present, we are satisfied with the effectiveness of our current auditors and hence have no plans to retender the external auditor appointment earlier. This position is re-evaulated each year.\n\nBoth Unilever and KPMG have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the external auditors' objectivity and independence could be compromised, such as audit partner rotation and the restriction on nonaudit services that the external auditors can perform as described below. KPMG has issued a formal letter to the Committee outlining the general procedures to safeguard independence and objectivity, disclosing the relationship with the Company and confirming their audit independence.\n\nEach year, the Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external audit process which includes discussing feedback from the members of the Committee and stakeholders at all levels across Unilever. Interviews are also held with key senior management within both Unilever and KPMG. The FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR) team monitors the quality of audit work of certain UK audit firms through annual inspections of a sample of audits and related procedures at individual audit firms. During the year, the 2019 audit of the Group by KPMG was reviewed by the AQR and their report was issued in February 2021. The review identified a number of improvements. The Committee are in the process of engaging with the AQR and KPMG to ensure there is a full understanding of the issues and that all the appropriate actions have been undertaken or are in the process of being undertaken by KPMG.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the statutory audit, other audit and non-audit services provided by KPMG and compliance with Unilever's documented approach, which prescribes in detail the types of engagements, listed below, for which the external auditors can be used:\n\n- \u25a0 statutory audit services, including audit of subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 other audit services - audits that are not required by law or regulation; and\n- \u25a0 non-audit services - work that our external auditors are best placed to undertake, which may include:\n- \u25a0 services required by law or regulation to be performed by the audit firm; and\n- \u25a0 services where knowledge obtained during the audit is relevant to the service such as bond issue comfort letters.\n\nUnilever has for many years maintained a policy which prescribes in detail the types of engagements for which the external auditors can be used with all other engagements being prohibited. The policy is aligned with both European and SEC regulations and was updated during the year in line with these regulations.\n\nAll engagements over \u20ac250,000 require specific advance approval by the Audit Committee Chairman. The Committee further approve all engagements which have been authorised by the EVP Financial Control, Risk Management, Pensions & Sustainability. These authorities are reviewed regularly and, where necessary, updated in the light of internal and external developments. Since the appointment of KPMG in 2014 the level of non-audit fees has been below 7% of the annual statutory audit fee. The level of other audit fees has been below 6% of the annual statutory audit fee except for 2017 (41%), 2018 (24%) and 2020 (32%) due to assurance work relating to the disposal of our Spreads business (2017 and 2018) and assurance work relating to the separation of our Tea business (2020).\n\n## Evaluation of the Audit Committee\n\nAs part of the internal Board evaluation carried out in 2020, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2020. While overall the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively, the Committee agreed that given the Covid-19 crisis, to further enhance its effectiveness whilst operating virtually, it needed to ensure continued engagement with the Group's operations by organising virtual site visits.\n\nJohn Rishton\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\nJudith Hartmann\n\nSusan Kilsby",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) comprises three Non-Executive Directors: Strive Masiyiwa (Chair), Youngme Moon and Feike Sijbesma.\n\nThe Chief Supply Chain Officer, the Chief Sustainability Officer and the Chief Business Integrity Officer attend the Committee's meetings. The Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary may also join the Committee's discussions.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees Unilever's conduct as a responsible global business. Core to this remit has been the Committee's tracking of the progress and potential risks associated with the decadelong Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). As the Plan came to its conclusion in 2020, the Committee will turn its attention to monitoring the company's progress as guided by its new Compass strategy (see page 8 to 9).\n\nThe Committee is also charged with ensuring that Unilever's reputation is protected and enhanced, so it must consider the company's influence and impact on stakeholders. Central to this is the need to identify any external developments that are likely to have an influence on Unilever's standing in society, and to ensure that appropriate and effective communications policies are in place to support the company's reputation.\n\nReviewing health and safety and ensuring Unilever's Code of Business Principles continues to reflect best practice are also within the Committee's scope. Complementing the CRC's role, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing significant breaches of the Code of Business Principles as part of its remit to review risk management and for overseeing the independent assurance programme for the USLP and Unilever's new strategy, the Compass.\n\nThe CRC's discussions are informed by the experience of the Unilever Leadership Executive - as those accountable for driving responsible and sustainable growth through Unilever's brands and operations. Other senior leaders are invited to the Committee to share their perspectives and insights on key issues and external developments. These in-depth discussions ensure the Committee stays alert to current and emerging trends and any potential risks arising from sustainability issues. The Committee captures these insights for the Board through formal feedback and the ongoing sharing of knowledge.\n\nDuring 2020 the Committee reviewed its terms of reference and agreed that minor modifications were required to reflect Unification.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are set out at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.unilever.com/corporategovernance\n\nMeetings are held quarterly and ad hoc as required - five were held in 2020, including an additional meeting to agree the scope of the Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) 2021 Sustainability Progress Index. The Committee Chairman is responsible for reporting the findings from meetings to the Board, thus ensuring that the Board can fulfil their oversight responsibilities.\n\nFollowing the Committee's terms of reference and Unilever's principal risks, in 2020 the Committee's agenda covered the Code and third-party compliance, safety, plastic packaging, the USLP and Compass strategy, corporate reputation and litigation.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee also addressed a range of other strategic and current issues. How Unilever handled the Covid-19 pandemic was\n\nfirst and foremost in these discussions, but other topics spanned human rights, how Dove puts its brand purpose into action and the company's activities and advocacy at the World Economic Forum.\n\n## How the Committee has discharged its responsibilities\n\nIn 2020, the Committee's principal activities were as follows:\n\n## Code of Business Principles\n\nThe Code and associated Code Policies set out the standards of conduct expected of all Unilever employees in their business endeavours. Compliance with these is an essential element in ensuring Unilever's continued business success and is identified as an ethical, legal and regulatory risk to Unilever (see page 50).\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for oversight of the Code and Code Policies, ensuring that they remain fit for purpose and are appropriately applied. It maintains close scrutiny of the mechanisms for implementing the Code and Code Policies. This is vital as compliance is essential to promote and protect Unilever's values and standards, and hence the good reputation of the Group.\n\nIn 2020, the Code of Business Principles was refreshed to include the provision of a living wage for employees, ethical use of data, a greater focus on health and safety by including mental wellbeing, and a commitment to transparency.\n\nAt each meeting the Committee reviews an analysis of investigations into non-compliance with the Code and Code Policies and discusses any trends arising from these investigations.\n\nThe Committee also considers litigation and regulatory matters which may have a reputational impact and reviews a summary of any significant developments at each meeting. These matters include environmental issues, anti-bribery and corruption and competition law compliance\n\nThe Committee studied Unilever's latest methodology for assessing anti-bribery and corruption risks and the comprehensive mapping of these risks by country and business activities. These and a number of other initiatives have helped Unilever move to Band A of Transparency International UK's Anti-Corruption Compliance Benchmark.\n\nIt also reviewed the range of programmes Unilever runs to ensure it complies with the growing number of competition laws worldwide as well as its own Code of Business Principles policy on competition.\n\n## Principles and standards for third parties\n\nExtending Unilever's values to third parties is essential if Unilever is to generate responsible growth and a positive social impact on the industry.\n\nA lack of third-party compliance can pose a significant risk to the business, (see principal risks, page 50), so the Committee examines Unilever's compliance programmes in detail to ensure risks are minimised.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee tracks compliance with Unilever's Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) for suppliers and its Responsible Business Partner Policy (RBPP) for customers and distributors. Together they set out Unilever's requirements that third parties conduct business with integrity and respect for human rights and core labour principles. In 2020, responsibility for supplier compliance was transferred from Supply Chain into the Business Integrity function allowing a clearer segregation of responsibilities for running the RSP and its compliance oversight. Sourcing 100% of Unilever's procurement spend in line with the RSP was a target within the USLP. See page 30 for details.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nThe need to keep people safe came to the fore in the face of Covid-19. At the outset of the pandemic, the Committee emphasised the vital role a global business can play in protecting not only its own workers but local communities through pooling resources and sharing knowledge with governments and partners.",

        "page_content": "The Committee requested an ongoing update of Unilever's Covid-19 preparations and actions across its business and supply chain. Unilever's approach centred on ensuring business continuity and ensuring people were physically equipped and felt psychologically secure in the workplace or when working from home, see page 16. While setting up and putting in place detailed guidance and protocols to ensure that its factories continued to operate in 2020, Unilever maintained its safety standards and continued to protect people from accidents. Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) improved, but sadly two contractors and one employee lost their lives (see page 17).\n\nRecognising the potential burden on mental health imposed by the pandemic, the Committee probed Unilever on how it is supporting its employees. Unilever has longstanding employee assistance programmes which are accessible to all employees. More use was made of these programmes during the year as the demands of the pandemic started to affect people's wellbeing (see pages 16 to 17). The Committee commended these programmes and the thoroughness of the approach, counselling Unilever to maintain its monitoring and protection of employees' wellbeing.\n\nThe Committee also examined Unilever's approach to security. As a global business, Unilever operates in many countries, some of which suffer from a weak rule of law or from growing social and political unrest. Similarly, cyber threats continue to expand. The business continues to upgrade its resilience programmes to protect its people and assets.\n\n## Taking action on plastics, climate and nature\n\nPackaging waste and single-use plastic in particular continued as high priorities for the business and society in 2020. Unilever's goals cover using more recycled and less virgin plastic, improving the recyclability of plastic and an industry-leading commitment to an absolute reduction in plastic (see pages 10 and 29). Covid-19 has impacted a number of these activities but Unilever has remained committed to its goals and much progress was maintained during the year.\n\nThe effects of climate change and nature loss are becoming ever more apparent and increasingly urgent. In June Unilever set out new and stretching goals on climate and nature (see pages 10 and 28 to 29). These succeed the targets in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan.\n\n## Taking action on living standards and creating opportunities\n\nUnilever has developed ambitious new social goals to complement its environmental goals, recognising the interdependence of people and planet. The new goals set out to contribute to a fairer and more socially inclusive world.\n\nThe first of these goals sets out to ensure that everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever will earn at least a living wage or income by 2030. It will also create more opportunities for people by: being more inclusive, removing barriers and reaching under-represented groups; increasing representation of diverse groups in its advertising; and upskilling its workforce and helping young people get ready for work (see pages 17 to 18). Unilever scrutinises its social strategy from a gender perspective, drawing on respect for human rights as the foundational principle underpinning its approach.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nThe Committee discussed Unilever's approach to diversity and inclusion as the Black Lives Matter movement gathered pace during the year. Alongside its new social goals, Unilever has strengthened its focus on race, establishing a racial and ethnic equity taskforce to deliver its racial equity strategy. Race runs in tandem with the other elements of Unilever's equity, inclusion and diversity strategy, namely gender, disability and LGBTQI+ (see page 19).\n\n## Protecting and enhancing Unilever's reputation\n\nEnsuring its good reputation is maintained is vital to Unilever's ongoing success. As activism rises, commentary on issues such as deforestation for palm oil or animal testing can travel faster and wider than ever before, while social media continues to amplify and accelerate issues. As noted above, one of the most significant changes in 2020 was the spotlight placed on businesses by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAs the Committee charged with overseeing Unilever's reputation, members scrutinised Unilever's processes for managing issues. These proactive processes are defined within a clear governance framework and have been enhanced with more sophisticated forecasting techniques to gauge likely future issues and extended training.\n\n## Sharing expert perspectives\n\nThe Unilever Sustainability Advisory Council comprises external experts from fields as diverse as human rights, gender and the environment. Its role is to provide an independent view and challenge as strategies are mapped out and implemented by Unilever's management.\n\nIn spring 2020, the Council came together with the Board to share insights and perspectives. The meeting addressed a number of crucial issues: deforestation and eco-system protection; gender, inclusion and diversity; and human rights.\n\nThese discussions offered the Board the chance to examine how Unilever's strategies are viewed by the different stakeholder groups represented on the Council, and to probe the impact Unilever's strategies have delivered.\n\n## Management Co-investment Plan\n\nUnilever's Reward Framework includes the Management Co-investment Plan (MCIP), a long-term incentive plan that is linked to financial and USLP performance (see pages 92 to 93).\n\nTo come to a view on the USLP, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee evaluate performance against a Sustainability Progress Index (SPI).\n\nThe SPI is an assessment that captures quantitative and qualitative elements. Firstly, it considers the 2019 performance on USLP targets reported on Unilever's website, alongside performance evidenced in a number of sustainability ratings and indices. These targets illustrate how Unilever aims to address a number of its principal risks, such as brand preference, climate change, plastic packaging, supply chain and ethics (see our risks on pages 46 to 50). The second part of the assessment takes into account Unilever's wider progress on sustainability.\n\nFollowing an in-depth discussion of the SPI, the Corporate Responsibility Committee agreed a performance rating which was endorsed by the Compensation Committee. This joint assessment forms part of the Compensation Committee's overall recommendation on MCIP (see page 93).\n\nSubject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM, the Performance Share Plan (PSP) replaces the MCIP as the sole long term incentive plan. The performance measures for the PSP will continue to include the currently used Sustainability Progress Index (see pages 92 to 93).\n\nFor 2021, PSP SPI awards will be assessed against the final year of the USLP (performance in 2020). A new SPI will be agreed to reflect Unilever's Compass strategy. This will apply to PSP awards made from 2022 onwards.\n\n## Evaluation of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nAs part of the internal Board evaluation carried out in 2020, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2020 and concluded that it was working effectively.\n\nMembers agreed to enhance the working of the Committee by including more external perspectives in its discussions and by continuing to fine-tune how it assesses the SPI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.unilever.com/planet-and-society\n\n## Strive Masiyiwa\n\nChair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nYoungme Moon\n\nFeike Sijbesma",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\nThe Committee is comprised of three Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman. The Group Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. Other attendees at Committee meetings in 2020 were the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief HR Officer.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is primarily responsible for periodically assessing the structure, size and composition of the Board evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, diversity and knowledge on the Board; ongoing succession planning (including the development of a diverse pipeline for succession); drawing up selection criteria and appointment procedures for Directors; reviewing the feedback in respect of the role and functioning of the Board Committees arising from Board and Board Committee evaluations; and, periodic reviewing and assessing Unilever's practices and procedures in relation to workforce engagement. It also has oversight of all matters relating to corporate governance and brings any issues in this respect to the attention of the Board.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are set out in 'The Governance of Unilever' which can be found on our website at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.unilever.com/corporategovernance\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed its own terms of reference to determine whether its responsibilities are properly described. The amended terms became effective on 29 November 2020.\n\nIn 2020 the Committee met four times. At the start of the year the Committee considered the results of the Committee's annual selfevaluation for 2019 and its priorities for the year and used these to help create an annual plan for meetings for 2020.\n\n## Appointment and reappointment of Directors and ULE\n\n## Reappointment of Directors\n\nAll Directors (unless they are retiring) are nominated by the Board for re-election at the AGM each year on the recommendation of the Committee who, in deciding whether to recommend nomination of a Director, take into consideration the outcomes of the Chairman's discussions with each Director on individual performance, the evaluation of the Board and its Committees and the continued good performance of individual Directors. Non-Executive Directors normally serve for a period of up to nine years. The average tenure of the Non-Executive Directors who have retired from the Board over the past ten years has been seven years. The schedule the Committee uses for orderly succession planning of Non-Executive Directors can be found on our website at\n\n- www.unilever.com/committees\n\nMarijn Dekkers retired from the Board and did not put himself forward for reappointment at the AGMs in April 2020. The Committee proposed the reappointment of all other Directors and the Directors were appointed by shareholders by a simple majority vote at the AGMs bringing the then number of Non-Executive Directors from eleven to ten.\n\nThe Committee also recommends to the Board candidates for election as Chairman and Senior Independent Director. After being reappointed as Non-Executive Director at the 2020 AGMs, Youngme Moon remained the Senior Independent Director.\n\nCommittee Chairs remained in place in 2020 with John Rishton as Chair of the Audit Committee, Strive Masiyiwa as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee, Vittorio Colao as Chair of the Compensation Committee and Nils Andersen as Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nOn 18 February 2021 Vittorio Colao stepped down as a director. Andrea Jung has replaced Vittorio Colao as Chair of the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Succession planning and Board changes\n\nIn consultation with the Committee, the Board reviews the adequacy of succession planning processes and the actual succession planning at Board level.\n\nWhen recruiting, the Committee will take into account the profile of Unilever's Board of Directors set out in 'The Governance of Unilever' which is in line with the recommendations of applicable governance regulations and best practice. Pursuant to the profile the Board should comprise a majority of Non-Executive Directors who are independent of Unilever, free from any conflicts of interest and able to allocate sufficient time to carry out their responsibilities effectively. With respect to composition and capabilities, the Board should be in keeping with the size of Unilever, its strategy, portfolio, consumer base, culture, geographical spread and its status as a listed company and have sufficient understanding of the markets and business where Unilever is active in order to understand the key trends and developments relevant for Unilever. The objective pursued by the Board is to have a variety of nationality, race, gender, ethnicity, social background and relevant skills and expertise. It is important that the Board has sufficient global experience and outlook, and financial literacy. As discussed later in this Report, Unilever currently has a diverse Board in terms of gender and nationality and, as can be seen from the subset of the mapping that this Committee has done of the current Non-Executive Directors' skills and capabilities on page 65, composition and capabilities in line with our Board profile described above.\n\n## ULE succession planning and appointment\n\nIn consultation with the Committee, the Board reviews the adequacy of succession planning processes and the actual succession planning at ULE level.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity Policy\n\nUnilever has long understood the importance of diversity and inclusion within our workforce because of the wide range of consumers and other stakeholders we connect with globally. This goes right through our organisation, starting with the Board.\n\nUnilever's Board Diversity Policy, which is reviewed by the Committee each year, is reflected on our website at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.unilever.com/boardsofunilever\n\nThe Board believes that the composition and quality of the Board should be in keeping with the size and geographical spread of Unilever, its portfolio, culture and status as a listed company. A diverse Board with a range of views enhances decision-making which is beneficial to the company's long-term success and in the interests of Unilever's stakeholders. Thus, the Board believes that Unilever Directors must be selected on the basis of wide-ranging experience, backgrounds, skills, knowledge and insight with a continuing emphasis on diversity of its members.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee also reviewed and considered relevant recommendations on diversity and remains pleased that 50% of our Non-Executive Directors and 42% of all Directors were women and that nine nationalities were represented on the Board. As regards ethnicity, in 2020 eight directors identified themselves as White, three Directors identified themselves as Asian and one Director identified himself as Black. Further details on our approach to diversity and inclusion as well as gender balance of our workforce can be found on page 19.\n\n## Corporate Governance Developments\n\nThe Committee reviews relevant proposed legislation and changes to relevant corporate governance codes at least twice a year. It carefully considers whether and how the proposed laws/rules would impact upon Unilever and whether Unilever should participate in consultations on the proposed changes. For example, during 2020, developments on the virtual Shareholder meetings, pay gap reporting and Boardroom diversity were discussed by the Committee.\n\n## Evaluation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nAs part of the Board evaluation carried out in 2020, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own composition and performance in 2020.

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to be attended.\n\n## Letter from the Chair\n\n## Dear shareholders,\n\nAs the Committee Chair, I am pleased to present Unilever's Directors' Remuneration Report 2020. In the sections below, I set out:\n\n- \u25a0 our business performance in 2020 and how it links to key remuneration outcomes for the year; and\n- \u25a0 our new Remuneration Policy, which is being presented for shareholder approval at the May 2021 AGM.\n\n## Business performance and remuneration\n\nUnilever demonstrated in 2020 resilience and agility in the face of an unprecedented and continuing global crisis.\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Unilever acted decisively to place health, safety and wellbeing of our people worldwide at the forefront of our decisions during this extraordinary period. Our supply chain teams and frontline employees maintained production levels across 290 manufacturing sites and were able to ensure the supply of essential hygiene and food products. We protected our workforce from sudden drops in pay arising from market disruption or from being unable to undertake their role. This protection covered not only our employees but also contractors and others who we manage or who work on our sites, on a full- or part-time basis. Unilever has delivered this protection without seeking any direct financial support from any government worldwide.\n\nDuring 2020, Unilever moved quickly to focus the business on competitive growth, absolute underlying operating profit and Free Cash Flow delivery. The business responded swiftly to shifts in customer demand patterns. Growth was driven by hand and home hygiene products and in home food and refreshments. Food service and out of home ice cream sales declined, impacted by channel closures. As people stayed at home and had fewer opportunities to socialise, they spent less time on personal care which impacted sales in much of the Beauty and Personal Care business. Online channels grew strongly, and our e-commerce business grew significantly. Alongside growing competitively with an increase in underlying sales of 1.9%, Unilever generated underlying operating profit of \u20ac9.4 billion and Free Cash Flow of \u20ac7.7 billion, an increase of \u20ac1.5 billion compared to the prior year.\n\nUnilever maintained its quarterly shareholder dividend throughout the year, and increased it in the fourth quarter, reflecting our confidence in the prospects for our business as the impact of the pandemic on our markets became clearer.\n\n## Outcomes for 2020 annual bonus\n\nThe formulaic outcome for the 2020 annual bonus plan against targets that were set before the Covid-19 pandemic came into view was 48% as detailed in the chart on page 90.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Committee decided neither to change the targets in response to the pandemic nor to exercise discretion on the formulaic outcome, which therefore will be applied for the Executive Directors and members of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE).\n\nAccordingly, the Committee confirmed a bonus of 48% of target opportunity for both the CEO Alan Jope (resulting in a bonus of 72% of fixed pay against a target of 150%), and the CFO Graeme Pitkethly (resulting in a bonus of 58% of fixed pay against a target of 120%).\n\n## Outcomes for GSIP and MCIP vesting in 2021\n\nWhilst we have fallen short of our multi-year 3-5% growth ambition, we were well on track to achieve our Underlying Operating Margin improvement (UOM) ambition of 20% before the impact of Covid-19. Our Free Cash Flow was well ahead of target and our Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) was in the high teens. We faced challenges delivering our Underlying Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth targets due to the negative impact of Covid-19 and the headwind of elevated translation currency impacts. Over the past three years (2018-2020) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) did not reach the threshold for vesting. We continued to make strong progress on our USLP agenda, achieving a 130% outcome for the Sustainability Progress Index.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Committee decided neither to change the targets for these long-term incentive plans in response to the pandemic nor to exercise discretion on the formulaic outcomes. The following outcomes therefore will be applied for respective Executive Directors and members of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE).\n\nThe formulaic outcome for the 2017-2020 Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) was 83% of target as detailed in the chart on page 92, (corresponding to a vesting of 42% of the maximum of 200% for our two Executive Directors), as detailed on page 92.\n\nThe formulaic outcome for the 2018-2020 Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP) was 52% of target as detailed in the chart on page 91 corresponding to a vesting of 26% of the maximum of 200% for the CFO (who received an award in 2018 under this plan), as detailed on page 91.\n\n## Our new Remuneration Policy for 2021\n\nOur Remuneration Policy was last approved at the May 2018 AGM. Consequently, it reaches the end of its three-year approval period and a new Remuneration Policy is being presented for shareholder approval at the May 2021 AGM.\n\nThe Committee has closely monitored the external environment on pay together with shareholder views and feedback from employees at all levels on the current reward structure.\n\nThe key changes we are proposing to make to our Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy are to:\n\n- \u25a0 replace the current long-term incentive plan, MCIP, with a new Performance Share Plan (PSP) that is entirely separate from the annual bonus plan;\n- \u25a0 replace the voluntary investment of bonus through MCIP with a mandatory deferral of 50% of the annual bonus in shares for three years;\n- \u25a0 set performance measures for the PSP that are strategically aligned with the business, as outlined below; and\n- \u25a0 reduce the long-term performance period from four to three years while maintaining a five-year period from award to release on PSP by increasing the retention period from one year to two years.",

        "page_content": "The Committee is making these changes to:\n\n- \u25a0 simplify remuneration arrangements;\n- \u25a0 enable the Committee to set stretching but achievable performance targets over realistic timeframes;\n- \u25a0 make incentives more resilient and less dependent on the outcome of the short term incentive;\n- \u25a0 deleverage incentives by separating the short- and long-term incentive plans (that were previous linked through MCIP);\n- \u25a0 reduce maximum pay;\n- \u25a0 maintain our Executive Directors' overall pay at a relatively restrained level compared to peers; and\n- \u25a0 more closely align Unilever's reward structure with standard market practice.\n\nHaving undertaken an extensive consultation exercise before finalising the new Remuneration Policy, the Committee believes it can be fully supported by the great majority of our shareholders.\n\nAs with our previous Reward Framework, Unilever will cascade the new approach across our 14,400+ managers throughout the whole business worldwide. Many of the most junior colleagues have shared feedback that they find the current MCIP structure complex and financially burdensome, which may negatively impact the motivational effectiveness of current remuneration arrangements. The Committee is satisfied that the new structure addresses these issues, and is therefore confident that the new approach will be well received by employees.\n\n## Changes to Remuneration Policy\n\nThe key changes in the new Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy are summarised in the following sections.\n\n## Change in target and maximum pay levels\n\nIn moving from the current MCIP to the proposed PSP structure, the annual bonus opportunity remains unchanged while the potential value of the long-term PSP has been increased at target and decreased at maximum. The overall result is an increase in target pay of 13%/12% for the CEO/CFO respectively and decrease in maximum pay of 6% for both individuals.\n\nAs fixed pay and annual bonus remain unchanged, the increase in target pay opportunity can only be realised through the delivery of long-term performance against stretching three-year performance conditions with any such award held in Unilever shares for a further two years. This strengthens alignment of Executive Directors' pay to the long-term performance of the business and the shareholder experience, while reducing the level of maximum pay.\n\nIn determining the quantum for pay, the Committee did consider external benchmarking data against a group of comparable major European companies, as detailed on page 79. Whilst the Committee is neither led by benchmarking data, nor targets a specific benchmark position, this data provides an important reference point to ensure that pay levels for the Executive Directors of Unilever are not significantly out of line with the market. Under the proposed policy, total target compensation is around lower quartile for our CEO and around median for our CFO. The Committee is mindful that this relatively low market position is in contrast to Unilever's market capitalisation in the top quartile of the comparator group. The Committee believes this market benchmarking data clearly shows that the proposals do not provide excessive levels of remuneration versus the market. Furthermore, the Committee believes that a lower level of target compensation than proposed would create undue risks in terms of retention and or any future recruitment.\n\n## Incentive performance measures for 2021\n\nOur proposed annual bonus policy continues to state that at least 70% of measures must be financial in nature. For 2021 all of our proposed measures are financial and they are the same as for 2020:\n\n- \u25a0 Underlying Sales Growth (1/3);\n- \u25a0 Underlying Operating Margin (1/3);\n- \u25a0 Free Cash Flow (1/3).\n\nThe Committee continues to believe that these are the best measures to assess one year financial performance at Unilever.\n\nWe are proposing a new set of metrics for our long-term incentive, PSP, to further strengthen strategic alignment to the company's longer term aims:\n\n- \u25a0 Competitiveness: % Business Winning Market Share (25%);\n- \u25a0 Cumulative Free Cash Flow (25%);\n- \u25a0 Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) (25%);\n- \u25a0 Sustainability Progress Index (25%).\n\nThe rationale for each of the proposed PSP performance measures for 2021 is set out below:\n\n- \u25a0 Competitiveness: % Business Winning Market Share: Winning market share across our portfolio is a key strategic driver for long-term sustainable growth. Accordingly, this measure assesses, each year, the aggregate turnover of portfolio components (country/category cells) where Unilever is gaining market share as a % of total turnover that is measured by market data. It measures what proportion of our revenue is being generated when growing market share versus our competitors. In adopting this measure, the Committee has confirmed the focus on gaining share across the breadth of our portfolio and believes this is the best method to track progress. As with other measures, the Committee will undertake a supplementary evaluation, to confirm that the outcome of this measure provides a good and fair assessment of how competitiveness is contributing to Unilever's growth performance.\n- \u25a0 Cumulative Free Cash Flow measure: Free Cash Flow from operating activities in current currency ensures sufficient cash is available to fund a range of strategic capital allocation choices.\n- \u25a0 Return On Invested Capital (ROIC): Supports disciplined investment of capital within the business and encourages acquisitions which create long-term value.\n- \u25a0 Sustainability Progress Index (SPI): Building a sustainable business that benefits multiple stakeholders continues to be Unilever's Business model. Consequently, the Committee has resolved to retain SPI as a long-term performance measure.\n\n## Engaging with shareholders\n\nBefore finalising the new Remuneration Policy, the Committee consulted with shareholders, and major proxy advisers including the Investment Association, ISS, Glass Lewis, Hermes and Eumedion on the new Policy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the shareholders and proxy voting agencies for their time spent engaging with us and providing commentary on our proposed changes to our Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nThrough this consultation process, the Committee was pleased to receive overwhelming support for the main structural changes to our Remuneration Policy. In particular, shareholders were supportive of delinking the annual bonus from the long-term incentive opportunity through the discontinuation of MCIP and its replacement with the new PSP, together with mandatory deferral of half the annual bonus award in Unilever shares for three years.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\nDuring our consultation process, a significant number of investors expressed a strong view that they would prefer ROIC to be retained as a performance measure within the PSP instead of the introduction of relative total shareholder return (TSR), as we had originally proposed. The Board is committed to generating superior returns on capital for our investors and whilst the Committee felt that a relative TSR measure would more closely reflect the shareholder experience we reflected on the feedback and decided to retain ROIC within the PSP, in line with the views expressed by shareholders.\n\nSome shareholders asked if we will maintain the current policy limits to discretion i.e. that formulaic incentive outcomes can be adjusted upwards and downwards by up to 25% for annual bonus and 10% for the long-term incentive. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and best practice the Committee decided to remove these limits so that the Committee can use discretion fully to override any formulaic outcome (including to nil) that does not accurately reflect the outcome the Committee considers to be appropriate to the circumstances.\n\n## Executive Director fixed pay increases\n\nThere will be no fixed pay review for the Executive Directors in the first half of 2021. Such a review will take place in the second half of 2021, with any potential changes based on performance, external circumstances and salary increases for the wider workforce.\n\n## CEO and CFO Target Total Pay\n\n|                         | Alan Jope CEO   \u20ac'000 p.a.   | Alan Jope CEO   \u20ac'000 p.a.   | Graeme Pitkethly CFO  \u20ac'000 p.a.   | Graeme Pitkethly CFO  \u20ac'000 p.a.   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                         | Proposed  Policy             | Current  Policy              | Proposed  Policy                   | Current  Policy                    |\n| Fixed pay               | 1,508                        | 1,508                        | 1,136                              | 1,136                              |\n|                         | 2,262                        | 2,262                        | 1,363                              | 1,363                              |\n| Bonus (% fixed pay)     | (150%)                       | (150%)                       | (120%)                             | (120%)                             |\n| PSP (% fixed pay)       | 3,016 (200%)                 | n/a                          | 1,817 (160%)                       | n/a                                |\n| MCIP* Match share award | n/a                          | 2,273 (150%)                 | n/a                                | 1,370 (120%)                       |\n| Total Compensation      | 6,786                        | 6,043                        | 4,316                              | 3,869                              |\n\n## CEO and CFO Maximum Total Pay\n\n|                         | Alan Jope CEO   \u20ac'000 p.a.   | Alan Jope CEO   \u20ac'000 p.a.   | Graeme Pitkethly CFO  \u20ac'000 p.a.   | Graeme Pitkethly CFO  \u20ac'000 p.a.   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                         | Proposed  Policy             | Current  Policy              | Proposed  Policy                   | Current  Policy                    |\n| Fixed pay               | 1,508                        | 1,508                        | 1,136                              | 1,136                              |\n|                         | 3,393                        | 3,393                        | 2,045                              | 2,045                              |\n| Bonus (% fixed pay)     | (225%)                       | (225%)                       | (180%)                             | (180%)                             |\n| PSP (% fixed pay)       | 6,032 (400%)                 | n/a                          | 3,635 (320%)                       | n/a                                |\n| MCIP* Match share award | n/a                          | 6,820 (450%)                 | n/a                                | 4,110 (360%)                       |\n| Total Compensation      | 10,933                       | 11,721                       | 6,816                              | 7,291                              |\n\nThe figures in these tables are calculated pursuant to UK requirements.\n\n- * MCIP at maximum (67%) investment of bonus.\n\n## Engaging with employees\n\nAs previously announced, the Board decided to share the responsibility for workforce engagement among all Non-Executive Directors to ensure that all Directors have a collective responsibility for bringing employee views into relevant board discussion. We continued these engagements in 2020, see page 63 for a summary of the discussions that took place. I also communicated to all employees to provide an update of Unilever's Executive Directors' remuneration, highlighting how this aligns with employees' remuneration and with our medium and long-term purpose and strategy. In the context of the renewal of the Remuneration Policy the Committee was briefed on employee feedback on the introduction of the new Reward Framework that was gathered through surveys, interviews, focus groups and consultation with the relevant employee representative bodies. See page 84.\n\n## Implementation report\n\nThe annual report on remuneration in this report describes 2020 remuneration in detail together with the planned implementation of the proposed Remuneration Policy in 2021 (including remuneration decisions for 2021). It also includes a description of the Committee's key activities in the year.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee and the entire Board, I thank all shareholders and their representatives for their constructive engagement in 2020 and look forward to your support for our remuneration related proposals at the 2021 AGM.\n\nAndrea Jung Chair of the Compensation Committee",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Policy report\n\nThe following sets out our new Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Remuneration Policy). It fundamentally continues our existing policy principles with some key proposed changes, which are discussed below.\n\nThis new Remuneration Policy will be presented for approval by shareholders at the 2021 AGM and, if approved, will apply to payments made after that date and will replace the existing remuneration policy in its entirety. It is intended that the new Remuneration Policy will apply for three years, although the Committee may seek approval for a new policy at an earlier point if it is considered appropriate. The supporting information section provides the rationale for any changes from the existing remuneration policy where appropriate.\n\n## Fixed pay\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nSupports the recruitment and retention of Executive Directors of the calibre required to implement our strategy. Reflects the individual's skills, experience, performance and role within the Group.\n\n## Operation\n\nSet by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee and generally reviewed once a year, with any changes usually effective from 1 January (although changes may be made at any other time if the Committee considers that is appropriate).\n\nFixed pay is paid in cash and is generally paid monthly. Fixed pay is set at an appropriate level to attract and retain Executive Directors of the required calibre, taking into account:\n\n- \u25a0 our policy generally to pay at around the median of an appropriate peer group of other global companies of a similar financial size and complexity to Unilever;*\n- \u25a0 the individual's skills, experience and performance; and\n- \u25a0 pay and conditions across the wider organisation.\n\n## Performance measures\n\n## n/a\n\n## Opportunity\n\nAny increases will normally be in line with the range of increases awarded to other employees within the Group.\n\nIncreases may be above this level or applied more frequently in certain circumstances, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 where there is, in the Committee's opinion, a significant change in an Executive Director's scope or role;\n- \u25a0 where a new Executive Director has been appointed to the Board at a rate lower than the typical market level for such a role and becomes established in the role; and\n- \u25a0 where it is considered necessary to reflect significant changes in market practice.\n\nThe maximum aggregate increase for the current Executive Directors during the time in which this policy applies will be no higher than 25% for each Director.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThe maximum aggregate increase to fixed pay has been increased to 25% over the life of this Policy. This change is being made to provide the Committee flexibility in the case of any unforeseen circumstances. The Committee would engage with shareholders in the event that a material fixed pay increase is proposed.\n\n- *  The current peer group includes Anheuser-Bush InBev, Bayer, BP, British American Tobacco, Danone, Diageo, GlaxoSmithKline, Heineken, Hermes Intl., L'Or\u00e9al, LVMH, Nestl\u00e9, Novartis, Reckitt Benckiser, Royal Dutch Shell, Sanofi, Total and Volkswagen (XET). The peer group used for benchmarking purposes is reviewed regularly and companies are added and/or removed at the Committee's discretion to ensure that it remains appropriate.\n\n## Benefits\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nProvides certain benefits on a cost-effective basis to aid attraction and retention of Executive Directors.\n\n## Operation\n\nBenefits include provision of death, disability and medical insurance cover, directors' liability insurance and actual tax return preparation costs. Other benefits may be provided in the future where it is considered necessary by the Committee and/or required by legislation.\n\nIn the event that Unilever were to require an existing or new Executive Director to relocate, Unilever may pay appropriate relocation allowances for a specified time period of no more than three years. This may cover costs such as (but not limited to) relocation, cost of living, housing benefit, home leave, tax and social security equalisation and education assistance.\n\nExecutive Directors are entitled to participate on the same terms as all UK employees in the Unilever PLC Sharebuy Plan.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nBased on the cost to Unilever of providing the benefit and dependent on individual circumstances.\n\nRelocation allowances - the level of such benefits would be set at an appropriate level by the Committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individual and typical market practice.\n\nAwards under the all-employee Unilever PLC Sharebuy Plan may be up to HMRC-approved limits. The only change in the value of the current benefits (for single figure purposes) will reflect changes in the costs of providing those benefits.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nn/a\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThere are no changes relative to the previous remuneration policy.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\n## Annual bonus\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nIncentivises year-on-year delivery of rigorous short-term financial, strategic and operational objectives selected to support our annual business strategy and the ongoing enhancement of shareholder value.\n\nThe ability to recognise performance through annual bonus enables us to manage our cost base flexibly and react to events and market circumstances.\n\n## Operation\n\nEach year Executive Directors may have the opportunity to participate in the annual bonus plan. Executive Directors are set a target opportunity that is assessed against the business performance multiplier of up to 150% of target opportunity at the end of the year.\n\nDirectors are required to defer 50% of their bonus into shares or share awards for three years. Deferred bonus awards can earn dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period and may be satisfied in cash and/or shares. Deferral may be effected under the Unilever Share Plan, or by such other method as the Committee determines.\n\nUltimate remedy/malus and claw-back provisions apply (see details on page 81).\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThe maximum annual bonus opportunity under this Policy is 225% of fixed pay.\n\nThe normal target bonus opportunity for the CEO is 150% of fixed pay, and for the CFO is 120% of fixed pay. This results in normal maximums of 225% and 180% respectively.\n\nAchievement of threshold performance results in a payout of 0% of the maximum opportunity.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nThe business performance multiplier is based on a range of business metrics set by the Committee on an annual basis to ensure that they are appropriately stretching for the delivery of threshold, target and maximum performance. These performance measures may include Underlying Sales Growth (USG), Underlying Operating Margin improvement (UOM) and Free Cash Flow (FCF), along with any other measures chosen by the Committee, as appropriate. The Committee also sets the weightings of the respective metrics on an annual basis.\n\nThe Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of the business performance multiplier, if it believes this better reflects the underlying performance of Unilever. In any event, the overall business performance multiplier will not exceed 150%. The use of any discretion will be fully disclosed in the directors' remuneration report for the year to which discretion relates.\n\nThe Committee may introduce non-financial measures in the future subject to a minimum of 70% of targets being financial in nature.\n\nPerformance is normally measured over the financial year.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThere are two changes from the previous policy. The first is the requirement for 50% of bonus to be deferred, rather than voluntarily invested into the Management Co-Investment Plan (the historic long-term incentive plan). The second is that the Committee can now override any formulaic outcome (including to nil), instead of being limited to adjusting by 25%. This is in line with best practice and the UK Corporate Governance Code. Any exercise of discretion will continue to be disclosed in full in the relevant directors' remuneration report.\n\nThe Policy sets out a single maximum opportunity that applies to any potential Executive Director, this is different to the previous policy which sets out different maximum opportunities for each Director. This is intended to simplify the Policy, and provide flexibility if needed over the course of the Policy. If the Committee sought to increase the annual grant for the CFO, it would only do so after engaging with shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Performance Share Plan (PSP)\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\n## Operation\n\nThe Performance Share Plan (PSP) replaces the Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) as the sole long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Under the PSP, Executive Directors are granted rights to receive free shares on vesting (awards) which normally vest after three years, to the extent performance conditions (described below) are achieved. Upon vesting, Executive Directors will have an additional two-year retention period (during which shares cannot be sold) to ensure there is a five-year duration between the grant of the award and release of the shares.\n\nUltimate remedy/malus and claw-back provisions apply (see details on page 81).\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThe maximum annual grant available under this Policy is 400% of fixed pay.\n\nThe normal maximum award for the CEO is 400% of fixed pay, and for the CFO is 320% of fixed pay.  At target 50% of maximum vests, equating to 200% and 160% of fixed pay respectively. 0% of the award will vest for below threshold performance. The amount payable for threshold performance will be disclosed for each metric in the relevant directors' remuneration report.\n\nDividend equivalents may be earned (in cash or additional shares) on the award when and to the extent that the award vests. Dividends or dividend equivalents will also be payable in respect of dividends paid during the retention period.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nThe Committee sets performance measures for each PSP award. These will be tested over the three financial years starting with the financial year in which the award is granted.\n\nThe performance measures for the PSP grants in 2021 will be: Competitiveness: % Business Winning Market Share (% Business Winning), Cumulative Free Cash Flow (current FX rates), Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), and Sustainability Progress Index (SPI). ROIC and SPI are used currently and the other two measures are new. Each measure will have a 25% weighting. The Committee retains the discretion to change these measures and/or weighting for future grants, based on strategic priorities for Unilever at that time.\n\nThe Committee will ensure that the targets set are appropriately rigorous for the delivery of threshold, target and maximum performance.\n\nThe Committee retains the discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of these performance measures to reflect its assessment of the underlying long-term performance. The use of any discretion will be fully disclosed and explained in the directors' remuneration report for the year to which discretion relates.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nMaximum opportunity as a percentage of fixed pay has reduced from 450% of fixed pay under the previous MCIP to 400% of fixed pay for the CEO under the PSP and from 360% of fixed pay to 320% of fixed pay for the other Executive Directors. Conversely, target opportunity has increased from 150% of fixed pay to 200% for the CEO and from 120% to 160% for other Executive Directors. As per the rationale included in the chairman's letter this increase in target opportunity will only be realised subject to performance against stretching three-year performance conditions and will be delivered fully in shares which executives will not be able to sell until five years after grant.\n\nThe Policy sets out a single maximum opportunity that applies to any potential Executive Director, this is different to the previous policy which sets out different maximum opportunities for each Director. This is intended to simplify the Policy, and provide flexibility if needed over the course of the Policy. If the Committee sought to increase the annual grant for the CFO, it would only do so after engaging with shareholders.\n\nThe PSP, which operates under the plan rules approved at the 2017 AGMs, is assessed over a three-year performance period and there is a retention period for executive directors for two additional years before those shares are released. This is the same total timeframe as the previous MCIP which had a four-year performance period and one-year holding period.\n\nThe Committee can now override any formulaic outcome (including to nil), instead of being limited to adjusting by 10%. This is in line with best practice and the UK Corporate Governance Code. Any exercise of discretion will continue to be disclosed and explained in full in the relevant directors' remuneration report.\n\nPreviously the Committee considered the quality and sustainability of underlying performance if the outcomes of any annual bonus and the MCIP it was invested in exceeded 75% of maximum. This strict requirement is removed due to the delinking of annual bonus and long-term incentives. However, the Committee will continue to assess the quality and sustainability of performance when determining if any adjustments are required to overall formulaic outcomes.\n\n## Elements of previous policy that will continue\n\nMCIP awards granted under a previous remuneration policy will continue to operate under the terms of that policy and the relevant plan rules. Further details of the terms of the awards made are included in the directors' remuneration reports for their respective years. This applies to the MCIP awards granted in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. This provision will cease to apply once all of these awards have vested, been exercised or been forfeited as appropriate, as per the relevant policy and plan rules. Additional details are set out below.\n\n## Claw-back, ultimate remedy, discretion and flexibility\n\nClaw-back: Claw-back is the recovery of payments made under the annual bonus (including deferred bonus shares) or vested LTIP awards, (both PSP awards under this Remuneration Policy, and awards under any previous remuneration policies). The Committee may decide to apply claw-back for up to three years from the payment of bonus awards, and up to two years from vesting for the PSP or MCIP awards (including where awards vest prior to or during the retention period), in the event of:\n\n- \u25a0 a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever;\n- \u25a0 error in calculation or misleading data; or\n- \u25a0 corporate failure.\n\nClaw-back may apply to all or part of a participant's payment or award and may be effected, among other means, by reducing outstanding awards, or requiring the return of the net value of vested awards to Unilever.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\nMalus: Malus is the adjustment of bonus, unvested deferred bonus awards or unvested LTIP awards (both PSP awards under this Remuneration Policy, and predecessor awards under any previous remuneration policies). The Committee may apply malus to reduce an award or determine that it will not vest or only vest in part. Malus applies to deferred bonus awards during the three-year deferral period and to unvested LTIP awards (PSP awards under this Remuneration Policy and predecessor awards under any previous remuneration policies) during the vesting period and retention period , in the event of:\n\n- \u25a0 a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever;\n- \u25a0 gross misconduct or gross negligence;\n- \u25a0 material breach of Unilever's Code of Business Principles or any of the Unilever Code Policies;\n- \u25a0 breach of restrictive covenants by which the individual has agreed to be bound, or conduct by the individual which results in significant losses or serious reputation damage to Unilever; and\n- \u25a0 for PSP awards and deferred bonus awards, error in calculation or misleading data or corporate failure.\n\nThe annual bonus will also be subject to malus on the same grounds as apply for deferred bonus awards and unvested LTIP awards. This power is an addition to the normal discretion to adjust awards and the additional sustainability test outlined in the policy table.\n\nUltimate remedy: Awards under the PSP (and predecessor long-term incentives under any previous remuneration policy) are subject to ultimate remedy. Upon vesting of an award, the Committee shall have the discretionary power to adjust the value of the award if the award, in the Committee's opinion taking all circumstances into account, produces an unfair result. In exercising this discretion, the Committee may take into account Unilever's performance against non-financial measures.\n\nThese powers are in addition to the normal discretion to adjust awards and the additional sustainability test outlined in the policy table.\n\nUltimate remedy/malus and claw-back will not apply to an award which has been exchanged following a change of control and claw-back will not apply where an award vests on a change of control.\n\nCommittee discretion to amend targets/measures: For PSP awards (or MCIP awards under the previous policy) and annual bonus, the Committee may change a performance measure or target (including replacing a measure) in accordance with the award's terms or if anything happens which causes the Committee reasonably to consider it appropriate to do so. The Committee may also adjust the number or class of shares subject to MCIP, PSP and deferred bonus awards if certain corporate events (e.g. rights issues) occur.\n\nThe Committee will continue to review targets on all unvested awards in the event of any material acquisitions or disposals that were not included in the financial plan, or were not anticipated at the time of target setting. The Committee may make adjustments if deemed appropriate to ensure that all targets remain relevant and equally stretching in light of any M&A activity, other corporate events, or any other event that the Committee considers to be material, that was not foreseen at the time of target setting.\n\n## Legacy arrangements\n\nFor the duration of this Remuneration Policy, entitlements arising before the adoption of this Remuneration Policy will continue to be honoured in line with the approved remuneration policy under which they were granted, or their contractual terms.\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any relevant discretions) notwithstanding that they are not in line with this Remuneration Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before this Remuneration Policy came into effect or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of Unilever and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of Unilever. For these purposes, 'payments' includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Remuneration scenarios: our emphasis on performance-related pay\n\nIt is Unilever's policy that the total remuneration package for Executive Directors should be competitive with other global companies and that a significant proportion should be performance-related.\n\nFor the remuneration scenarios below, the maximum and target pay opportunities have been chosen to be consistent with the current levels for Executive Directors. In reviewing the appropriate level of pay opportunity for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers internal and external comparators. Although pay is not driven by benchmarking, the Committee is aware that pay needs to be within a reasonable range of competitive practice. The Committee notes that total target pay is slightly below lower quartile for the CEO and slightly below median for our CFO for the benchmark group used by the Committee.\n\nThe Committee typically reviews, on at least an annual basis, the impact of different performance scenarios on the potential reward opportunity and payouts to be received by Executive Directors and the alignment of these with the returns that might be received by shareholders. The Committee believes that the level of remuneration that can be delivered in the various scenarios is appropriate for the level of performance delivered and the value that would be delivered to shareholders. The charts below show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors in the first full year of the policy under below threshold, target and maximum performance scenarios.\n\n## CEO Alan Jope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFixed pay",

Unilever's primary business objective is to create value in a sustainable way. Performance measures focus management on the delivery of a combination of top-line revenue growth and bottom-line profit growth that Unilever believes will build shareholder value over the longer term and that will benefit all of our stakeholders.\n\nThe measures chosen for the incentives will support the delivery of this objective, with distinct measures for each of the short- and longer-term incentive programmes.\n\nThe Committee sets performance targets for incentive plans, taking into account internal budgets, business priorities and external forecasts so that the targets are sufficiently stretching. Good performance results in target payout while maximum payout is only achieved for delivering exceptional performance.\n\nThe following sets out the performance measures for short- and long-term incentive plans to be awarded in 2021, as well as the business performance and the behaviours that they drive.\n\n| Performance measures and the link to strategy   | Performance measures and the link

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\n## Changes in pay policy generally\n\nThe key changes in the new Remuneration Policy are to:\n\n- \u25a0 replace the current long-term incentive plan, the MCIP with the PSP - a long-term incentive plan that is operated entirely separately from the annual bonus plan;\n- \u25a0 replace voluntary investment in the long-term incentive plan with a mandatory deferral of 50% of the annual bonus into shares or share awards, for three years;\n- \u25a0 change the performance measures for the long-term incentive plan (to maximise the strategic alignment as outlined above);\n- \u25a0 reduce maximum total pay; and\n- \u25a0 maintain a five-year period from award to release on PSP by reducing the performance period from four years to three years, and increasing the retention period from one year to two years.\n\nThe Committee wants to increase the impact, traction and resilience of Unilever's incentives to drive sustainable long-term growth which can be better achieved with distinct short- and long-term incentive plans, enabling the Committee to set stretching but achievable performance targets over realistic timeframes. This change more closely aligns Unilever's reward structure with standard market practice.\n\nBy separating short- and long-term incentive plans the policy will further simplify executive pay. Currently, these are linked by our MCIP as the MCIP opportunity is driven by the outcome of the annual bonus plan. Delinking the two plans will deleverage incentives, reduce maximum pay and make our incentives more resilient and less dependent on the short-term incentive.\n\n## Change in target and maximum pay levels\n\nIn moving from the current MCIP to the proposed PSP structure, the quantum of the previous annual bonus has been unchanged and the quantum of the PSP has been increased at target and decreased at maximum. The overall result is an increase in target pay of 13%/12% for the CEO/CFO respectively and decrease in maximum pay of 6% for both individuals.\n\nAs fixed pay and annual bonus opportunities have been unchanged, this increase in target opportunity will only be realised subject to performance against stretching three-year performance conditions and will be delivered fully in shares which executives will not normally be able to sell until five years after grant. This is to create an even stronger alignment to both the long-term performance of the business and the shareholder experience, and to address shareholder comments on the levels of maximum pay available under the previous structure.\n\nIn determining the appropriate quantum, the Committee did consider external benchmarking data against a group of comparable major European companies. Whilst the Committee is not led by benchmarking data, or target a specific benchmark position, this data is used as a reference point to ensure that pay levels are not significantly out of line with the market. Under the proposed changes total target compensation is slightly below lower quartile for our CEO and slightly below median for our CFO. This is despite the fact that Unilever is above the upper quartile of this group by market capitalisation. The Committee believes this data shows that the proposals do not provide excessive levels of remuneration versus the market. In addition, the Committee believes that a lower level of target compensation would create undue risks in terms of retention or any future recruitment.\n\nThe Committee was also cognisant of the need to maintain a sufficient pay differential between the Executive Directors and the rest of the ULE and this modest increase at target pay helps the Committee to do this.\n\n## Application beyond the Board\n\nRemuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle: that reward should support our business strategy and should be sufficient to attract and retain high-performing individuals without paying more than is necessary. Unilever is a global organisation with employees at a number of different levels of seniority and in a number of different countries and, while this principle underpins all reward arrangements, the way it is implemented varies by geography and level.\n\nIn principle, all our managers participate in the same Unilever annual bonus scheme with the same performance measures based on Unilever's overall performance and the requirement to defer 50% of bonus also extends to the ULE. The intention is to extend the new policy across all of Unilever's 14,400+ managers worldwide in 2021. Wherever possible, all other employees have the opportunity to participate in the global 'buy 3 get 1 free' employee share plan called 'SHARES', which is offered in more than 100 countries.\n\nThrough these initiatives we continue to encourage all our employees to adopt an owner's mindset with the goal of achieving our growth ambition, so they can share in the future long-term success of Unilever.\n\n## Stakeholders' considerations:\n\nGuided by our purpose-led and future-fit business model the Committee has applied a multi-stakeholder approach in reviewing the current reward framework in view of the 2021 policy renewal. The Committee has therefore engaged with various stakeholders, both internally and externally as set out below.\n\n## Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group\n\nWhen determining the pay of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay arrangements for other employees in the Group, including considering the average global pay review budget for the management population, to ensure that remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors remain reasonable. Unilever takes the views of its employees seriously and on an ongoing basis, we conduct the 'Rate-My-Reward' survey to gauge the views of employees on the different parts of their reward package.\n\nIn establishing the Future Reward Framework, Unilever conducted an employee survey amongst its WL1+ population to seek their views on Unilever's approach to reward. Interviews and focus groups have also been organised for the management population to receive feedback on the proposed Future Reward Framework. In addition, the company consulted with the European Works Council and employee representation bodies in other relevant jurisdictions. Employees value the mix between fixed and variable pay, and the various benefits (including non-cash benefits), but there is also a desire for more flexibility in reward to fit individual's different life stages. The Future Reward Framework is well received for its simplicity and market alignment. It is seen as a more competitive, inclusive and fair reward programme. The ability to receive the bonus in cash rather than having to invest it to receive a long-term incentive award is valued in times of uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. More senior employees would have preferred the continuation of an attractive opportunity to investment in Unilever shares. Based on feedback from the European Works Council, we will continue to explore opportunities to widen and deepen Unilever's all-employee share scheme.\n\nFairness in the workplace is a core pillar of the Compass and incorporates our Framework for Fair Compensation. As part of our Framework's living wage element, we are committed to pay a living wage to all our direct employees. At the end of 2020, 100% of Unilever's direct employees globally were paid at or above a certified living wage level. Further detail can be found on page 19. The living wage principle is also endorsed as good practice in Unilever's Responsible Sourcing Policy. The Committee already upholds its obligation under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (see page 14) to consider the impact of what we do on our multiple stakeholders. These considerations shape the way the Committee looks at pay and sets pay rates for our Executive and Non-Executive Directors relative to our wider workforce. We will continue to advance these initiatives over the years ahead to enhance the livelihoods of all our employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consideration of shareholder views\n\nThe Committee takes the views of shareholders seriously. We maintain an open and regular dialogue with our shareholders on remuneration matters, including consulting with our largest investors and shareholder representative bodies, when we are considering making material changes to our remuneration policy. Accordingly, shareholders have been consulted extensively and their views have been influential in shaping this Remuneration Policy. Their feedback influenced our proposals in relation to the balance between fixed and variable pay, between the annual bonus and PSP components, and the performance measures for the incentives. Further details can be found on page 77.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nThe remuneration arrangements applicable to our Executive Directors require them to build and retain a personal shareholding in Unilever (within five years from the date of appointment with extra time granted if requirements increase significantly) to align their interests with those of Unilever's long-term shareholders. The current requirement is 500% fixed pay for the CEO and 400% fixed pay for the CFO. All shares beneficially owned and any awards not subject to performance conditions (but, for example, subject to retention or deferral periods) count towards the shareholding requirement (on an estimated net of tax basis if tax is expected to be payable). Incoming Executive Directors will be required to retain all shares vesting from any share awards (net of any sales to cover tax) until their minimum shareholding requirements have been met in full.\n\nAny Executive Director who leaves after the date the new Remuneration Policy has effect will be required to maintain at least 100% of their minimum shareholding requirement for two years after leaving. These shares will be held in the Company nominee vested accounts. If the leaver has not yet met their shareholding requirements on departure they will be required to retain the shares they do own up to these limits. This requirement can be waived in certain exceptional personal circumstances (e.g. death, disability, ill health).\n\n## Remuneration Policy for new hires\n\n| Area             | Policy and operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall          | The Committee will pay new Executive Directors in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy and all its  elements as set out herein above.

        "page_content": "## Non-Executive Directors\n\nKey aspects of Unilever's 2021 fee policy for Non-Executive Directors\n\n## Approach to setting fees\n\n## Operation\n\n## Other items\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive annual fees from Unilever. The Board determine Non-Executive Director fee levels, which are limited to the aggregate amount permitted by the Company's articles of association, as approved by shareholders from time to time (which is currently \u00a32 million (\u20ac2,253,013) per year, and will, subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM increase to \u20ac5 million per year (which reflects the applicable limit as approved by shareholders prior to Unification).\n\nUnilever's policy is to set fees at a level which is sufficient to attract, motivate and retain high-class talent of the calibre required to direct the strategy of the business without paying more than necessary. They are set taking into account:\n\n- \u25a0 the commitment and contribution expected by the Group;\n- \u25a0 fee levels paid in other global non-financial services companies based in Europe; and\n- \u25a0 that fees are paid in cash.\n\nUnilever applies a modular fee structure for Non-Executive Directors to ensure we fairly reflect the roles and responsibilities of committee membership and chairmanship. Our basic philosophy is to pay the Chairman an allinclusive fee. Other Board members receive a basic fee and additional fees for being Senior Independent Director, chairing or membership of various committees. The Board may decide to pay fees in any other currency based on such foreign exchange rates as the Board shall determine, provided total Non-Executive Director fees stay within the annual limits as approved by shareholders from time to time. The 2021 fee structure can be found in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 97. The fee structure may vary from year to year within the terms of this Remuneration Policy.\n\nFees are normally reviewed annually but may be reviewed less frequently.\n\nAdditional allowances are made available to Non-Executive Directors where appropriate, to reflect any additional time commitment or duties.\n\nNon-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a personal shareholding of at least 100% of their total annual fees over the five years from appointment.\n\nNon-Executive Directors are not entitled to participate in any of the Group's incentive plans.\n\nAll reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by Non-Executive Directors in the course of performing their duties are considered to be business expenses and are reimbursed together with any tax payable. Non-Executive Directors also receive expenses relating to the attendance of the Director's spouse or partner, when they are invited by Unilever. Other benefits or additional payments may be provided in the future if, in the view of the Board, this is considered appropriate. Such benefits and/or payments would be within the total annual limits as approved by shareholders as described above.\n\nThe Committee reserves the discretion to approve gifts to Non-Executive Directors who are retiring or who are considered by the Board to be otherwise leaving in good standing (e.g. those leaving office for any reason other than termination by Unilever or in the context of misconduct). If the value of the gift for any one Non-Executive Director exceeds \u00a35,000 it will be disclosed in the relevant directors' remuneration report. Where a tax liability is incurred on any such a gift the Committee has the discretion to approve the payment of such liability on behalf of the Non-Executive Director in addition to the value of the gift.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for new Non-Executive Director hires\n\nIn the event of hiring a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will align the remuneration package with the Remuneration Policy as set out above.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nThe terms of engagement of Non-Executive Directors are set out in letters of appointment which each Non-Executive Director signs upon appointment. Non-Executive Directors are currently appointed for a one-year term, subject to satisfactory performance, renomination at the discretion of the Board on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and re-election at forthcoming annual shareholder meetings. It is Unilever's expectation that Non-Executive Directors serve for a minimum of three years. The letters of appointment allow for Unilever to terminate a Non-Executive Director's appointment in cases of gross misconduct, failure to perform their duties competently, conduct bringing Unilever into disrepute, bankruptcy or where the Non-Executive Director is prevented from occupying such a position by law.\n\nThe letters do not contain provision for notice periods or compensation if the Non-Executive Directors' appointments are terminated by Unilever. Non-Executive Directors may terminate their engagement upon three months' notice. Except in exceptional circumstances, the Board will not propose Non-Executive Directors for renomination when nine years have elapsed since the date of their appointment. Letters of appointment are available for inspection on request from the Group Secretary.\n\nIn considering appointments to the Board, the Directors and Unilever give due consideration to the time commitment required to fulfil the role appropriately.",

A retention period of two years applies from vesting.\n\nCumulative Free Cash Flow, ROIC and Sustainability Progress Index are all established measures. Cumulative Free Cash Flow from operating activities in current currency ensures sufficient cash is available to fund a range of strategic capital allocation choices.\n\nROIC measures the return generated on capital invested by the Group and is calculated as underlying operating profit after tax divided by the annual average of: goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, net assets held for sale inventories, trade and other current receivables, and trade payables and other current liabilities. The target range of a threshold of 15% and maximum of 19% expresses our commitment to deliver ROIC at a level of mid to high teens, whilst continuing to reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and disposals.\n\nCompetitiveness: % Business Winning Market Share (% Business Winning) is a new metric for incentive purposes. It has been part of operational management and will be part of management's performance updates to investors. % Business Winning will be assessed each year as the aggregate turnover of the portfolio components (country/category cells) gaining value market share as a % of the total turnover measured by market data. As such it assesses what percentage of our revenue is being generated in areas where we are gaining market share. The outcome for the 2021-2023 PSP is the average of the 3 years % Business Winning performance. With intense competition and changing shopper trends, winning share in each portfolio or geography segment presents a challenge for all players; repeating these wins over successive years is even more demanding. At consolidated Group level delivering consistently in the range of 50% business winning will enable us to grow with our markets, delivering a premium above 50% Business Winning over successive years supports our objective of growing ahead of our markets. Keeping this in mind, the Committee believes that a target of 52.5% Business Winning and a stretch of 60%, to be appropriate, with a threshold performance of 45% Business Winning paying out zero for this performance measure.\n\nIn addition to the three elements mentioned above, our Executive Directors are provided with non-monetary benefits to aid attraction and retention. These include medical insurance cover, actual tax return preparation costs and provision of death-in-service benefits and administration.\n\n## Ultimate remedy/malus and claw-back\n\nGrants under the PSP, the legacy MCIP and the legacy GSIP are subject to ultimate remedy as explained in the remuneration policy. Malus and claw-back apply to all performance-related payments as explained in the remuneration policy.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee did not reclaim or claw back any of the value of awards of performance-related payments to current or former Executive Directors.",

These have been translated into euros using the exchange rates on the date of vesting (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8711 and \u20ac1 = $1.2136).\n\n## Performance: MCIP 2017-2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance metric (weighting)                                                  | Threshold 0%   | Threshold 0%   | Target 100%   | Maximum 200%   | vesting  (%of  target)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Underlying Sales Growth (CAGR) (25%)                                            | 2.0%           | 2.7%           |               | 6.0%           | 35%                      |\n| Underlying Earnings Per Share Growth (CAGR, Current FX) (25%)                   | 5.3% 7.0%      |                |               | 13.0%          | 0%                       |\n| Return On Invested Capital  (Exit year %) (25%)                                 | 15.4%          |                | 18.0%         | 18.4%          | 175%                     |\n| Sustainability Progress Index (Committee assessment of USLP progress) (25%) (a) | 0%             |                | 124%          | 200%           | 124%                     |\n| Overall vesting                                                                 | 0%             | 83%            |               | 200%           | 83%                      |\n\nResult\n\nFurther details of the MCIP outcome are described in the Committee's Chair letter on page 76. Further details on the Sustainability Progress Index vesting is set out below. On the basis of this performance the Committee determined that the MCIP awards at the end of 2020 will vest at 83% of initial target award levels (i.e. 42% of maximum for MCIP).\n\n## Outcome of Sustainability Progress Index (SPI) for MCIP cycle 2017-2020:\n\nOn 16 February 2021 the first MCIP cycle vested with SPI as one of the four performance measures. The SPI is an assessment of the business's sustainability performance by the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee that captures quantitative and qualitative elements (see page 73). The Corporate Responsibility Committee and Compensation Committee agreed a framework for SPI assessment that captures the breadth and depth of the USLP in relation to a number of key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs illustrate how Unilever aims to address a number of its principal risks such as brand preference, climate change, plastic packaging, supply chain and ethics (see Our risks on page 44). The Committees review qualitative and quantitative progress across each category and delivery against the KPIs. The Committees then agree on a SPI achievement level against the KPI taking into account performance across the entire SPI Category.\n\nIn previous directors' remuneration reports we have described the annual assessments and outcomes for the SPI years 2017, 2018 and 2019 and 2020 SPI performance (based on 2019 USLP performance) is set out on the following page. The SPI index for the four-year MCIP performance period is calculated by taking a simple average and is set out at the bottom of the table for MCIP 2017-2020.",

No adjustment was made to the level of MCIP awards granted because, in accordance with the applicable remuneration policy, the number of shares subject to each MCIP award was based on the portion of 2019 bonus which executives had already chosen to invest in Unilever shares at the time of award, so the Committee had limited flexibility to adjust grant levels for any element of windfall. Further, at the time of grant, it was too early to tell whether or not there would be windfall gains from the grant of awards because of their four-year time horizon and the fact that the immediate drop in Unilever's share price from its pre-Covid-19 levels was not as pronounced as that suffered by many other companies (particularly given it was not then clear whether that drop would be sustained over the longer term).\n\nWhen the MCIP awards vest, the Committee will look again at the question of windfall gains by looking at the following factors:\n\n- \u25a0 the level of share price growth delivered over the vesting period, compared to historical and expected norms;\n- \u25a0 an assessment of any share price growth that may be attributable to an improvement in Unilever performance, as opposed to general market / sector-specific movements.\n\nIf the Committee concludes that there have been windfall gains, it may use its discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of the performance conditions to mitigate the impact of any windfall. When determining whether or not there have been windfall gains in relation to the 2020 MCIP awards, the Committee will take into account share price movements over the whole vesting period of the 2020 MCIP awards - with particular focus on the share price and share price volatility over the portion of the vesting period during which the pandemic is determined to impact performance.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement and Executive Director share interests (Unaudited)\n\nThe remuneration arrangements applicable to our Executive Directors require them to build and retain a personal shareholding in Unilever within five years of their date of appointment to align their interests with those of Unilever's shareholders. Incoming Executive Directors will be required to retain all shares vesting from any share awards made since their appointment until their minimum shareholding requirements have been met in full.\n\nThe table below shows the Executive Directors' share ownership against the minimum shareholding requirements as at 31 December 2020 and the interest in PLC ordinary shares of the Executive Directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2020.\n\nWhen calculating an Executive Director's personal shareholding the following methodology is used:\n\n- \u25a0 fixed pay at the date of measurement;\n- \u25a0 shares in PLC will qualify provided they are personally owned by the Executive Director, by a member of his (immediate) family or by certain corporate bodies, trusts or partnerships as required by law from time to time (each a 'connected person');",

Letters of appointment were amended in November and December 2020 to reflect Unification.\n\n## Other disclosures related to Directors' remuneration (Unaudited)\n\nUnilever regularly looks at pay ratios throughout the company, and the pay ratio between each work level, and we have disclosed this for a number of years. The table below provides a detailed breakdown of the fixed and variable pay elements for each of our UK and Dutch work levels, showing how each work level compares to the CEO and CFO in 2020 (with equivalent figures from 2019 included for comparison purposes). Going forward we will disclose this compared to UK work levels.\n\n## CEO/CFO Pay Ratio Comparison (split by fixed/variable pay) CEO/CFO Pay Comparison (split by fixed/variable pay)\n\nFigures for the CEO and CFO are calculated using the data from the Executive Directors' single figure table on page 90. Accordingly, the year-on-year comparison reflects the significant drop in total compensation for the Executive Directors in 2020. This has been the result of the lower performance outcomes on bonus and long-term incentives, as well as the ending of the legacy GSIP. The numbers are further impacted by fluctuation in the exchange rates used to convert pay elements denominated in pounds sterling to euros for reporting purposes in 2019. From 2019 the CEO and CFO fixed pay is paid in euros. Where relevant, amounts for 2019 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2019 (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8799), and amounts for 2020 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2020 (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8877).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual bonus and long-term incentives (MCIP) for the UK and Dutch employees were not calculated following the statutory method for single figure pay. Instead, variable pay figures were calculated using:\n\n- \u25a0 target annual bonus values multiplied by the actual bonus performance ratio for the respective year (disregarding personal performance multipliers, which equal out across the population as a whole); and\n- \u25a0 MCIP values calculated at an appropriate average for the relevant Work Level of employees, i.e. an average 45% investment of bonus for WL3 employees; 60% for WL4-5 employees; and 100% for WL6 employees, mulitplied by the actual MCIP business performance ratio.\n\nFixed pay figures reflect all elements of pay (including allowances) and benefits paid in cash.",

Figures are calculated by reference to 31 December 2020, and the respective salary and pay and benefits figures for each quartile are set out in the table above. Full-time equivalent figures are calculated on a pro-rated basis.\n\nVariable pay figures for the UK employees are calculated on the basis set out in the paragraph for other work levels below the 'CEO/CFO pay ratio comparison' table. The reason for this is it would be unduly onerous to recalculate these figures when, based on a sample, the impact of such recalculation is expected to be minimal.\n\nYear-on-year comparisons reflects the lowering incentive performance outcomes in 2020. For the overall UK employee calculation salary has increased by approximately 1.29% (despite the lowering of performance outcomes and changes in FTE's), which is aligned to our defined peer group at the 50th percentile (market median), that we benchmark against on a yearly basis.\n\nAdditionally, in the UK we are required to show additional disclosures on the rates of change in pay year on year. The pay ratios set out above are more meaningful as they compare to the pay of all of our UK employees. By contrast, the UK regulations require us to show the percentages below based on employees of our PLC top company only, which forms a relatively small proportion of our total UK workforce. So, whilst operationally we may pay greater attention to our internal pay ratios (included above in the 'CEO/CFO pay ratio comparison' table), these new required figures are as follows:\n\n## Percentage change in remuneration of Executive Directors (CEO/CFO)\n\nThe table below shows the five-year history year-on-year percentage change for fixed pay, other benefits (excluding pension) and bonus for the CEO, CFO and PLC's employees (based on total full-time equivalent total reward for the relevant financial year) pursuant to UK requirements.

The remuneration and fees earned from that particular outside listed directorship may be retained (see 'Independence and Conflicts' on page 62 for further details).\n\nFor the reason above, Graeme Pitkethly is permitted to be a Non-Executive Director of Pearson PLC since 1 May 2019. In 2020 he received an annual fee of \u20ac104,014 (\u00a392,333) (2019: \u20ac64,969 (\u00a357,166)) (of which 25% was in accordance with Pearson's remuneration policy delivered in Pearson shares) based on an average exchange rate over 2020 of \u20ac1 = \u00a30.8877.

During 2020, the wider PwC firm has also provided tax and consultancy services to Unilever including tax compliance, transfer pricing, other tax-related services, managed legal services, internal audit advice and secondees, third-party risk and compliance advice, cyber security advice, sustainability assurance and consulting and merger and acquisition support. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK, which is available online.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com (Code of Conduct: Executive Remuneration Consulting)\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with PLC that might impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2020 were \u00a3196,000. This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee also sought input from the CEO (Alan Jope), the Chief Human Resources Officer (Leena Nair) and the VP Global Head of Reward (Constantina Tribou) on various subjects including the remuneration of senior management. No individual Executive Director was present when their own remuneration was being determined to ensure a conflict of interest did not arise, although the Committee has separately sought and obtained Executive Directors' own views when determining the amount and structure of their remuneration before recommending individual packages to the Boards for approval. The Committee also received legal and governance advice from the Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary (Ritva Sotamaa) and the Chief Counsel Executive Compensation & Employment (Margot Fransen).\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nUnilever remains committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. In the event of a substantial vote against a resolution in relation to Directors' remuneration, Unilever would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote and would set out in the following Annual Report and Accounts any actions in response to it.

The Directors are also required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Unilever Group, and PLC, as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss and cash flows for that year.\n\nThe Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, the Group and PLC have used the most appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which they consider to be applicable have been followed.\n\nThe Directors have responsibility for ensuring that PLC keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy their financial position and which enable the Directors to ensure that the accounts comply with all relevant legislation. They also have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThis statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditor's Report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the accounts.\n\nA copy of the financial statements of the Unilever Group is placed on our website at www.unilever.com/investorrelations. The maintenance and integrity of the website are the responsibility of the Directors, and the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters. Accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially placed on the website. Legislation in the UK and the Netherlands governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Independent auditors and disclosure of information to auditors\n\nUK law sets out additional responsibilities for the Directors of PLC regarding disclosure of information to auditors. To the best of each of the Directors' knowledge and belief, and having made appropriate enquiries, all information relevant to enabling the auditors to provide their opinions on PLC's consolidated and parent company accounts has been provided. Each of the Directors has taken all reasonable steps to ensure their awareness of any relevant audit information and to establish that Unilever PLC's auditors are aware of any such information.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement\n\nEach of the Directors confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- \u25a0 The Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2020, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u25a0 The financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u25a0 The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nThe Directors and their roles are listed on pages 64 to 65.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe activities of the Group, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance, the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 1 to 43. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 143 to 160 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk. Although not assessed over the same period as going concern, the viability of the Group has been assessed on page 45.\n\nThe Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements despite the current uncertain outlook.\n\nAfter making enquiries, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Internal and disclosure controls and procedures\n\nPlease refer to pages 46 to 50 for a discussion of Unilever's principal risk factors and to pages 44 to 50 for commentary on the Group's approach to risk management and control.",

Our opinions are unmodified\n\n## What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the financial statements ('the Financial Statements') of Unilever PLC ('the Company') for the year ended 31 December 2020 which comprise the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company Accounts, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.\n\n## Our opinions\n\nIn our opinion the Financial Statements:\n\n- \u25a0 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of the Group's and of the Company's profit for the year then ended;\n- \u25a0 have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act and international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (IFRS as adopted by the EU); and\n- \u25a0 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Consolidated Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation to the extent applicable.\n\n## Additional opinion in relation to IFRS as issued by the IASB\n\nAs explained in the accounting policies set out in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in addition to complying with its legal and regulatory obligation to apply international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act and IFRS as adopted by the EU, the Group has also applied IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law.

(KPMG NL). Following Unification (refer to page 61) the Group is represented by Unilever PLC and the entities controlled by Unilever PLC and the Consolidated Financial Statements are therefore solely audited by KPMG LLP (Unilever N.V. ceased to exist as of the merger date).\n\n## 2. Key audit matters: Our assessment of risks of material misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinions above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required, for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

        "page_content": "## Independent Auditor's Report continued\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## Our response and results\n\nRevenue is measured net of rebates, price reductions, incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs (''discounts'').\n\nCertain discounts for goods sold in the year are only finalised when the precise amounts are known and revenue therefore includes an estimate of variable consideration. The variable consideration represents the portion of discounts that are not directly deducted on the invoice and is complex as a result of diversity in the terms in contractual arrangements with customers. The unsettled portion of the variable consideration results in discounts due to customers per 31 December 2020 ('rebate accrual').\n\nTherefore, there is a risk of revenue being misstated as a result of incorrect calculations of the variable consideration.\n\nWithin revenue recognition we identified the rebate accrual as a key audit matter, as in a number of markets the rebate accrual is significant and the terms in contractual arrangements with customers are not uniform.\n\nThis is considered to be an area which had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit as significant effort was required in evaluating the contractual arrangements and the related rebate accrual.\n\nThere is also a risk that revenue may be overstated due to fraud through manipulation of the rebate accrual recognised resulting from the pressure management may feel to achieve performance targets.\n\nIn Brazil, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local indirect tax regimes (both state and federal), related to certain corporate reorganisations.\n\nWe identified the assessment of indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil related to a corporate reorganisation as a key audit matter. Due to the complex nature of the Brazilian local tax regimes and jurisprudence, there is a high degree of judgement applied by the Group with respect to this matter, which given the high degree of estimation uncertainty has a particularly wide potential extent of possible outcomes. Complex auditor's judgement and specialised skills were also required in assessing the outcome of investigations by the authorities, if a liability exists, and in making an estimate of any economic outflows.\n\n## Procedures\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter in a selected number of markets:\n\n- \u25a0 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the revenue process including controls over the rebate agreements, calculation of the rebate accrual, rebate payments and the Group's review over the rebate accrual.\n- \u25a0 Within the relevant Group's markets, used the prior year rebate accrual together with our understanding of current year developments to form an expectation of the rebate accrual at 31 December 2020. We compared this expectation against the actual rebate accrual, completing further corroborative inquiries and obtained underlying documentation as appropriate.\n- \u25a0 Tested a selection of recorded rebate accruals after 31 December 2020 and assessed whether the accrual is recorded in the proper period.\n- \u25a0 Tested a selection of payments made after 31 December 2020 and, where relevant, compared the payment to the related rebate accrual.\n- \u25a0 Critically assessed manual journals recorded to revenue to identify unusual or irregular items and obtained underlying documentation.\n- \u25a0 Assessed the Group's disclosures in respect of the rebate accrual.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (2019: satisfactory).\n\n## Procedures\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u25a0 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indirect tax process including controls around the assessment of the outcome of investigations if a liability exists and the quantification of the potential economic outflow.\n- \u25a0 We involved local indirect tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the contingent liabilities compared to the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations and related correspondence with the tax authorities.\n- \u25a0 assessing the impact of historical and recent judgements passed by the court authorities in considering any legal precedent or case law by inquiring of the Group's external lawyers and inspection of relevant information.\n- \u25a0 We inspected legal opinions from third party lawyers and obtained formal confirmations from the Group's external lawyers and, where relevant, compared to the underlying exposure.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (2019: satisfactory) and we considered the Brazilian indirect tax contingent liability disclosures to be acceptable (2019: acceptable).\n\n## Revenue recognition Discounts\n\nAs discussed in the report of the Audit Committee (page 70), note 2, note 13 and note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the rebate accrual was \u20ac3,852 million as of 31 December 2020 and \u20ac3,476 million as of 31 December 2019.\n\n## Indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil\n\nAs discussed in the Report of the Audit Committee (page 70) and note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Brazil indirect tax contingent liability related to a 2001 corporate reorganisation was \u20ac2,040 million as of 31 December 2020 and \u20ac2,235 million as of 31 December 2019.",

The laws and regulations for transfer pricing in each jurisdiction are open to different interpretations by taxpayers and tax authorities and require judgement in the interpretation thereof. Judgements are made by the Group with respect to interpretations of the tax legislation and in assessing the potential outcome of investigations by the authorities, and if a liability exists.\n\nWe identified the assessment of uncertain direct tax transfer pricing provisions as a key audit matter. Due to the complex nature of transfer pricing across multiple jurisdictions, there is judgement applied by the Group with respect to interpretations of the tax legislation, to assess the potential outcome of investigations by the authorities and if a liability exists. Complex auditor's judgement and specialised skills were also required in assessing the interpretations of the tax legislation, the potential outcome of investigations by the authorities and if a liability exists.\n\nThe fair value of the acquired intangible assets was \u20ac3.3 billion as of the acquisition date, a portion of which related to the Horlicks brand. The Group recorded the fair value of the Horlicks brand based on the expected cashflows of the brand.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the fair value measurement of the Horlicks brand acquired from GSK as a key audit matter. Significant judgements were made by the Group in determining the revenue growth rate and the discount rate used to develop the fair value of the Horlicks brand. Complex auditor's judgement and specialised skills were also required in evaluating these assumptions. Minor changes to these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the valuation of the Horlicks brand.\n\nOn 29 November 2020, the structure of the Group was further simplified from a dual parent structure to a single parent structure by way of a cross border merger of Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. Following the completion of the Unification, Unilever PLC is the sole parent company of the Group.\n\nWe identified the accounting for the Unification as a key audit matter due to the unique nature of the transaction as a cross border merger being affected by the legal and regulatory framework of two countries. We spent a significant amount of time and resources to assess the Group's interpretation of UK and Dutch Company and tax law as well as the interpretation of financial reporting standards.\n\n## Procedures\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u25a0 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls related to the income tax process including controls around the assessment of the potential outcome of investigations, interpretations of the tax legislation and if a liability exists.\n- \u25a0 We involved tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n- \u25a0 assessing the relevant changes to the business during the year and the corresponding impact of any changes to the transfer pricing models for compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 evaluating a selection of uncertain tax positions using our own expectations based on our knowledge of the Group, considering relevant judgements passed and investigations by authorities to assess the potential exposures and if a liability exists; and\n- \u25a0 reading the settlement agreements with the relevant tax authorities and assessing the reasonableness of corresponding adjustments.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the Group's disclosures in respect of direct tax provisions and uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (2019: satisfactory) and we found the level of direct tax provisions to be acceptable (2019: acceptable).\n\n## Procedures\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u25a0 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Group 's valuation process in relation to the Horlicks brand, including controls over the revenue growth and the discount rate.\n- \u25a0 We evaluated the revenue growth for the Horlicks brand by comparing it to historical actual revenues and external industry growth rates.\n- \u25a0 In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate applied by the Group by comparing it to a range of rates that were independently developed using publicly available market indices and market data for comparable entities.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the carrying amount of the brand to be acceptable.\n\n## Procedures\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:\n\n- \u25a0 We assessed the legal positions taken by the Group in relation to the interpretation of the UK and Dutch Company law and evaluated the Group's use of external experts.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the accounting for the transaction considering the requirements under UK legislation and the applicable financial reporting standards.\n- \u25a0 We involved tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the taxation impact of the transaction, based on the applicable laws and regulations.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the disclosures in respect of this transaction in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Company Accounts.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory.\n\n## Uncertain direct tax transfer pricing provisions\n\nAs discussed in the Report of the Audit Committee (page 70), note 6 and note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the uncertain direct tax provisions were \u20ac879 million as of 31 December 2020 and \u20ac787 million as of 31 December 2019, a portion of which related to transfer pricing.\n\n## Valuation of Horlicks brand acquired from GlasoSmithKline plc ('GSK')\n\nAs discussed in the Report of the Audit Committee (page 70), Note 1 and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on 1 April 2020 the Group acquired the GlaxoSmithKline plc Health Food Drinks portfolio in India and 20 other predominantly Asian markets.\n\n## Accounting for the Unification of Unilever's Corporate structure\n\nApplicable for both Consolidated Financial Statements and Company Accounts\n\nAs discussed in the Corporate Governance Report (page 61), the Report of the Audit Committee (page 70), Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 to the Company Accounts.",

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## Materiality\n\nMateriality for the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole was set at \u20ac380 million (2019: \u20ac380 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 4.8% (2019: 4.6%).  Materiality for the Company Accounts as a whole was set at \u00a3298 million (2019: \u00a361 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Company Net Assets, of which it represents 0.4% (2019: 0.8%).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company Accounts set at 75% (2019 : 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u20ac285 million for the Group (2019: \u20ac285 million) and \u00a3224 million (2019: \u00a346 million) for the Company. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u20ac20 million (2019: \u20ac20 million) and \u00a315 million (2019: \u00a35 million) which are identified during the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Company Accounts respectively, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Overall scope of our audit\n\nThe Group operates through a significant number of legal entities and these form reporting components that are primarily country based. To provide sufficient coverage over the Group's key audit matters, we performed audits of 15 components (2019: 15), which are included within 'Audit for group reporting purposes' below, as well as audits of account balances including revenue and the related accounts receivables balances at a further 22 (2019: 23) components which are included within 'Audit of account balances' below. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes but were included in the scope of our group reporting work in order to provide additional coverage.\n\nThe Group operates centralised operating centres in China, India, Mexico, Philippines and Poland that perform accounting and reporting activities alongside related controls. Together, these operating centres process a substantial portion of the Group's transactions. The outputs from the centralised operating centres are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components. Each of the operating centres is subject to specified audit procedures. Further audit procedures are performed at each reporting component to cover matters not covered at the centralised operating centres and together this results in audits for group reporting purposes on those reporting components.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results:\n\nTotal profits and\n\n|                                     | Number of   components   | Group revenue   | losses that made  up Group profit  before taxation   | Group total assets   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 2020                                |                          |                 |                                                      |                      |\n| Audits for group reporting purposes | 15                       | 52%             | 50%                                                  | 72%                  |\n| Audits of account balances          | 22                       | 26%             | 25%                                                  | 8%                   |\n| Total                               | 37                       | 78%             | 75%                                                  | 80%                  |\n| 2019                                |                          |                 |                                                      |                      |\n| Audits for group reporting purposes | 15                       | 53%             | 58%                                                  | 69%                  |\n| Audits of account balances          | 23                       | 26%             | 20%                                                  | 7%                   |\n| Total                               | 38                       | 79%             | 78%                                                  | 76%                  |\n\nThe remaining 22% (2019: 21%) of Group revenue, 25% (2019: 22%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before taxation and 20% (2019: 24%) of Group total assets is represented by a significant number of reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 3% (2019: 3%) of any of Group revenue, total profits and losses that made up Group profit before taxation or Group assets. A substantial portion of these components utilise the operating centres and are therefore subject to audit procedures performed at these operating centres. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the key audit matters detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u20ac1 million to \u20ac328 million (2019: \u20ac1 million to \u20ac275 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on components was performed by component auditors.\n\nIn view of restrictions on the movement of people across borders the Group audit team made changes to the planned audit approach to evaluate the component auditors' communications and the adequacy of their work. Under our original audit plan, we had intended to visit the components in countries Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, UK and USA to review selected component auditor documentation. Due to the aforementioned restrictions, this was not practicable in the current environment. As a result, we requested those component auditors to provide us with access to audit workpapers to perform these evaluations, subject to local law and regulations. In addition, due to the inability to arrange in-person meetings with such component auditors, we increased the use of alternative methods of communication with them, including through written instructions, exchange of emails and virtual meetings.\n\nThe Group audit team held virtual meetings with local management instead of physical site visits this year in Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, UK and USA (2019: Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, UK and USA). Telephone and/or online meetings were also held with these component auditors and the majority of the others that were not physically visited. The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with component auditors and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditors.\n\nThe work on 36 of the 37 components (2019: 36 of the 38 components) was performed by component auditors (KPMG member firms) and the audit of the Company, was performed by the Group audit team.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's  and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and the Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u25a0 continued slowdown in the broader macro-economic environment and therefore market growth;\n- \u25a0 increased global and local competition; and\n- \u25a0 external pressures on gross margin through cost price inflation.\n\nWe also considered realistic second order impacts, such as a major IT data breach, the loss of all material litigation cases and the impact of Brexit which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources. We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumptions that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the Group's current and projected cash and facilities and the outcome of their reverse stress testing. We considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u25a0 we consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Financial Statements is appropriate;\n- \u25a0 we have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u25a0 we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement on page 104 to the Financial Statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure on page 104 to be acceptable; and\n- \u25a0 the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 104 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.\n\n## 5. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u25a0 Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- \u25a0 Reading Board and audit committee minutes.\n- \u25a0 Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for directors.\n- \u25a0 Using analytical procedures to identify any usual or unexpected relationships.\n- \u25a0 Using our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in identifying the fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition. Further detail in respect of Revenue recognition - Discounts is set out in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report. We did not identify any additional fraud risks.\n\nIn determining the audit procedures we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls. For further details in respect to the Group-wide risk management controls refer to the report of the Audit Committee on page 70.\n\nWe also performed procedures including:\n\n- \u25a0 Identifying manual journal entries to test for all full-scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.\n- \u25a0 Evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions.\n- \u25a0 Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards) and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence. We discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations and we made use of our own forensic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge to assist us in evaluating the facts and circumstances.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.",

        "page_content": "## Independent Auditor's Report continued\n\n## 5. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect continued\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\n- \u25a0 Competition legislation (reflecting the Group's involvement in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities),\n- \u25a0 Employment legislation (reflecting the Group's significant and geographically diverse work force).\n- \u25a0 Health and safety regulation (reflecting the nature of the Group's production and distribution processes).\n- \u25a0 Consumer product law such as product safety and product claims (reflecting the nature of the Group's diverse product base).\n- \u25a0 Contract legislation (reflecting the Group's extensive use of trademarks, copyright and patents).\n- \u25a0 Data privacy (requirements from existing data privacy laws).\n- \u25a0 Environmental regulation (reflecting nature of the Group's production and distribution processes).\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 6. We have nothing to report on the other information\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2020 together with the Financial Statements. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and Directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- \u25a0 we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report and the Directors' report;\n- \u25a0 in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the Financial Statements; and\n- \u25a0 in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u25a0 the Directors' confirmation within the Viability Statement on page 45 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u25a0 the Principal Risk Factors disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u25a0 the Directors' explanation in the Viability Statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability Statement, set out on page 45 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longer-term viability.",

We have nothing to report on the other information continued\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- \u25a0 the directors' statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u25a0 the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the audit committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- \u25a0 the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to report in this respect.\n\n## 7. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u25a0 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u25a0 the Company Accounts and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u25a0 certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u25a0 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n## 8. Respective Responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 104, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. They are also responsible for: such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud, or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at\n\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 9.

The amount paid to repurchase these shares was initially recognised in other reserves and is transferred to retained profit on cancellation.\n- (c)   Includes purchases and sales of treasury shares, and transfer from treasury shares to retained profit of share-settled schemes arising from prior years and differences between exercise and grant price of share options.\n- (d)   The share-based payment credit relates to the non-cash charge recorded against operating profit in respect of the fair value of share options and awards granted to employees.\n- (e)   2020 includes \u20ac163 million paid for purchase of the non-controlling interest in Unilever Malaysia. 2018 includes a \u20ac662 million premium paid for purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Unilever South Africa from Remgro.\n- (f) As part of Unification (see note 1 for further details), the shareholders of NV were issued new PLC ordinary shares, and all NV shares in issue were cancelled. The net impact is recognised in retained profit.\n- (g)   Includes the reduction of PLC's share capital following the cessation of the Equalisation Agreement. Prior to Unification, a conversion rate of \u00a31= \u20ac5.143 was used in accordance with the Equalisation Agreement to translate PLC's share capital. Following Unification, PLC's share capital has been translated using the exchange rate at the date of Unification. To reflect the legal share capital of the PLC company, an increase to share premium of \u20ac73,364 million and a debit unification reserve for the same amount have been recorded as there is no change in the net assets of the group. This debit is not a loss as a matter of law.\n- (h)   Consideration for the Main Horlicks Acquisition included the issuance of shares in a group subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever Limited, which resulted in a net gain being recognised within equity.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 1.  Accounting information and policies\n\n## Unification\n\nOn 29 November 2020, the Unilever Group underwent a reorganisation so that there were no longer two parent companies, Unilever N.V. ('NV') and Unilever PLC ('PLC'), but one parent company PLC. This reorganisation is referred to as 'Unification' in the Group consolidated financial statements.\n\nPrior to 29 November 2020, the Group operated with two parent companies, NV and PLC, who together with the group companies operated as a single economic entity. NV and PLC had the same Directors and were linked by a series of agreements, including an Equalisation Agreement, which were designed so that the positions of the shareholders of both companies were as closely as possible as if they held shares in a single company. NV and PLC together formed a single reporting entity for the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements and group companies included in the consolidation included those companies controlled by NV or PLC.\n\nFollowing Unification, all group companies are now controlled solely by PLC. There is no change to the companies included in the Group as a result of Unification, other than NV ceasing to exist.\n\nUnification was implemented through a Cross-Border Merger, as a result of which (i) PLC acquired all of the assets, liabilities and legal relationships of NV by universal succession of title; (ii) NV was dissolved; and (iii) PLC issued and allotted shares in its capital to former NV shareholders, except for a very small minority of NV shareholders that chose to receive cash instead of PLC shares. The shareholders of NV received one new PLC share in exchange for each NV share held, consistent with the 1 to 1 equalisation ratio as set out in the Equalisation Agreement.\n\nThe transfer of assets and liabilities from NV to PLC that occurred as part of the Cross-Border Merger was within the Group so there is no revaluation of these assets and liabilities in the Group financial statements. The only impact to the consolidated balance sheet from Unification is within equity due to the cancellation of NV shares and issuance of PLC shares.\n\nAdditional details on the impact of Unification on the PLC company financial statements are given in the PLC Company Accounts on pages 168 to 176.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nGroup companies included in the consolidated financial statements for 2020 are PLC and all subsidiary undertakings, which are those entities controlled by PLC. Control exists when the Group has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return on investment.\n\nDue to the operational and contractual arrangements referred to above, prior to Unification NV and PLC formed a single reporting entity for the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, group companies included in the comparative information provided in the consolidated financial statements, for 2019 and 2018, are PLC and NV and those companies controlled by NV or PLC during those years.\n\nThe net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. As noted above, Unification did not cause the acquisition by the Group of any new business. All companies controlled by NV before Unification are included in the Group consolidation for the year ending 31 December 2020 and they were already Group companies prior to Unification.\n\nThe results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the date control ceases.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.\n\n## Companies legislation and accounting standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, international financial reporting standards (IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Refer to the going concern statement on page 104.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are the same as those which were applied for the previous financial year, except as set out above under the headings 'Unification' and 'Basis of consolidation' and below under the heading 'Recent accounting developments'.\n\nAccounting policies are included in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. These are presented as text highlighted in grey on pages 116 to 167. The accounting policies below are applied throughout the financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. The functional currency of PLC is pound sterling. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.\n\nForeign currency transactions in individual group companies are translated into functional currency using exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the balances in individual group companies are translated from their functional currency into euros. Apart from the financial statements of group companies in hyperinflationary economies (see below), the income statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.\n\nThe financial statements of group companies whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation and then translated into euros using the balance sheet exchange rate. Amounts shown for prior years for comparative purposes are not modified. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the Group assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years.\n\nThe ordinary share capital of PLC is translated to euro using the historical rate at the date the shares were issued (see note 15B on page 144).\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes during the year on net assets of foreign operations is recorded in equity. For this purpose net assets include loans between group companies and any related foreign exchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences arising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation and PLC, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.",

        "page_content": "## 1.  Accounting information and policies continued\n\nCumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of other reserves. In the event of disposal or part disposal of an interest in a group company either through sale or as a result of a repayment of capital, the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of group companies.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nThe Argentinian economy was designated as hyperinflationary from 1 July 2018. As a result, application of IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' has been applied to all Unilever entities whose functional currency is the Argentinian Peso. The application of IAS 29 includes:\n\n- \u25a0 Adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date;\n- \u25a0 Adjustment of the income statement for inflation during the reporting period;\n- \u25a0 The income statement is translated at the period end foreign exchange rate instead of an average rate; and\n- \u25a0 Adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency.\n\nThe main effects of the Group consolidated financial statements for 2020 are:\n\n- \u25a0 Total assets are reduced by \u20ac68 million\n- \u25a0 Turnover is reduced by \u20ac58 million\n- \u25a0 Operating profit is reduced by \u20ac23 million\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.\n\nThe following estimates are those that management believe have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:\n\n- \u25a0 Measurement of defined benefit obligations - the valuations of the Group's defined benefit pension plan obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions. These include discount rates, inflation and\n\nlife expectancy of scheme members. Details of these assumptions and sensitivities are in note 4B.\n\n- \u25a0 Measurement of consideration and assets and liabilities acquired as part of business combinations - estimates are required to value the assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets such as brands are commonly a core part of an acquired business as they allow us to obtain more value than would otherwise be possible. During 2020 Unilever completed several acquisitions, as explained in note 21. The Horlicks brand acquired in 2020 was valued at \u20ac2.7 billion based on the expected cashflows of the brand. We involved external professionals to advise on the valuation techniques and key assumptions in the valuation. This input, combined with our internal knowledge and expertise on the relevant market growth opportunities, enabled us to determine the appropriate brand valuation. Additionally,contingent consideration depends on an acquired business achieving targets within a fixed period. Estimates of future performance are required to calculate the obligations at the time of acquisition and at each subsequent reporting date. See note 21 for further information.\n\nThe following judgements are those that management believe have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 Separate presentation of items in the income statement - certain items of income or expense are presented separately as nonunderlying items. These are excluded in several of our performance measures, including underlying operating profit and underlying earnings per share due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence. See note 3 for further details.\n- \u25a0 Utilisation of tax losses and recognition of other deferred tax assets - The Group operates in many countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Management uses judgement to assess the recoverability of tax assets such as whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise losses - see note 6B.\n- \u25a0 Likelihood of occurrence of provisions and contingent liabilities events can occur where there is uncertainty over future obligations. Judgement is required to determine if an outflow of economic resources is probable, or possible but not probable. Where it is probable, a liability is recognised and further judgement is used to determine the level of the provision. Where it is possible but not probable, further judgement is used to determine if the likelihood is remote, in which case no disclosures are provided; if the likelihood is not remote then judgement is used to determine the contingent liability disclosed. Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters. External advice is obtained for any material cases.

The expected impact and progress is shown below.  In addition to the above, based on an initial review the Group does not currently believe adoption of the following standard/amendments will have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.\n\n| Applicable standard                                                                                  | Key requirements or changes in accounting policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest Rate Benchmark  Reform (Phase 2)  Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS  39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 | The amendments are applicable when an existing interest rate benchmark is replaced by another interest rate  benchmark.

Segment information\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nBeauty & Personal Care\n\nFoods & Refreshment\n\nHome Care\n\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of skin cleansing (soap, shower), hair care (shampoo, conditioner, styling), skin care (face, hand and body moisturisers) and deodorants categories.\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of ice cream, savoury (soups, bouillons, seasoning), dressings (mayonnaise, ketchup) and tea categories.\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of fabric category (washing powders and liquids, rinse conditioners) and includes a wide range of cleaning products.\n\n## Revenue\n\nTurnover comprises sales of goods after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and estimated returns. It does not include sales between group companies. Discounts given by Unilever include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs and are based on the contractual arrangements with each customer. Discounts can either be immediately deducted from the sales value on the invoice or off-invoice and settled later through credit notes when the precise amounts are known. Rebates are generally off-invoice. Amounts provided for discounts at the end of a period require estimation; historical data and accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision using the most likely amount method and in most instances the discount can be estimated using known facts with a high level of accuracy. Any differences between actual amounts settled and the amounts provided are not material and recognised in the subsequent reporting period.\n\nCustomer contracts generally contain a single performance obligation and turnover is recognised when control of the products being sold has transferred to our customer as there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer but depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. This is considered the appropriate point where the performance obligations in our contracts are satisfied as Unilever no longer has control over the inventory.\n\nOur customers have the contractual right to return goods only when authorised by Unilever. At 31 December 2020, an estimate has been made of goods that will be returned and a liability has been recognised for this amount. An asset has also been recorded for the corresponding inventory that is estimated to return to Unilever using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.\n\nSome of our customers are distributors who may be able to return unsold goods in consignment arrangements.\n\n## Underlying operating profit\n\nUnderlying operating profit means operating profit before the impact of non-underlying items within operating profit (see note 3). Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of segments. Underlying operating margin is calculated as underlying operating profit divided by turnover.",

Compensation for the ULE includes the full-year compensation for ULE members who joined part way through the year.\n\nDetails of the remuneration of Directors are given in the parts noted as audited in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 76 to 103.\n\n## 4B. Pensions and similar obligations\n\nFor defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement. The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments (such events are recognised immediately in the income statement). The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities (using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market).\n\nAll defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method by external consultants. The Group policy is that the most material plans, representing approximately 85% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year. Other material plans, accounting for a further 11% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year. Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years. Asset values for all plans are updated every year.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the company's obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans. The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.\n\n## Description of plans\n\nThe Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds. In certain countries the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis with assets held in external funds. Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries. Our largest plans are in the UK and the Netherlands. In the UK, we currently operate a combination of an open career average defined benefit plan with a salary limit for benefit accrual, and a defined contribution plan. The career average defined benefit plan will be closed to new entrants later in 2021. In the Netherlands, we operate a collective defined contribution plan for all new benefit accrual and a closed career average defined benefit plan for benefits built up to April 2015.\n\nThe Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the United States. These plans are predominantly unfunded.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe majority of the Group's externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities. The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Where Trustees (or equivalent) are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plan's stakeholders. They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the plan in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the long-term investment and funding strategy. The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the company's policies and decision-making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.\n\n## Investment strategy\n\nThe Group's investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based. The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided. To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The plans continue to invest a good proportion of the assets in equities, which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term, commensurate with an acceptable level of risk. The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain markets, inflation risk. There are no unusual entity or plan-specific risks to the Group. For risk control, the pension funds also have significant investments in liability matching assets (bonds) as well as in property and other alternative assets; additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above. The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle (Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets. The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, risk-controlled vehicles. The pension plans' investments are overseen by Unilever's internal investment company, the Univest Company.",

Pensions and similar obligations continued\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWith the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated. The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans (representing approximately 96% of total pension liabilities and other post-employment benefit liabilities).\n\n|                                                             | 31 December 2020               | 31 December 2020                       | 31 December 2019               | 31 December 2019                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | Defined benefit  pension plans | Other post-  employment  benefit plans | Defined benefit  pension plans | Other post-  employment  benefit plans |\n| Discount rate                                               | 1.3%                           | 3.3%                                   | 1.9%                           | 3.9%                                   |\n| Inflation                                                   | 2.2%                           | n/a                                    | 2.3%                           | n/a                                    |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                                | 2.9%                           | 3.0%                                   | 2.9%                           | 3.0%                                   |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment (where provided)   | 2.1%                           | n/a                                    | 2.2%                           | n/a                                    |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided) | 2.3%                           | n/a                                    | 2.4%                           | n/a                                    |\n| Long-term medical cost inflation                            | n/a                            | 5.1%                                   | n/a                            | 5.4%                                   |\n\nThe valuations of other post-employment benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost inflation, which falls from 6% to the long-term rate within the next four years. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.\n\nDuring 2020, refinements were made in assumption setting methodologies to reflect changes being made more generally by corporates and their advisers in setting discount rates and future inflation rates, specifically in the UK, which resulted in a \u20ac880 million lower liability.\n\nFor the UK and Netherlands pension plans, representing approximately 70% of all defined benefit pension liabilities, the assumptions used at 31 December 2020 and 2019 were:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nNetherlands\n\n|                                                                                          | 2020   | 2019   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate                                                                            | 1.4%   | 2.0%   | 0.7%   | 1.1%   |\n| Inflation                                                                                | 2.7%   | 2.9%   | 1.5%   | 1.5%   |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                                                             | 3.3%   | 3.2%   | 2.0%   | 2.0%   |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment (where provided)                                | 2.7%   | 2.8%   | 1.5%   | 1.5%   |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided)                              | 2.7%   | 2.8%   | 1.5%   | 1.5%   |\n| Number of years a current pensioner is expected to live beyond age 65:                   |        |        |        |        |\n| Men                                                                                      | 21.7   | 21.6   | 21.5   | 22.6   |\n| Women                                                                                    | 23.4   | 23.4   | 23.6   | 24.1   |\n| Number of years a future pensioner currently aged 45 is expected to live beyond  age 65: |        |        |        |        |\n| Men                                                                                      | 22.7   | 22.6   | 23.4   | 24.5   |\n| Women                                                                                    | 24.6   | 24.6   | 25.4   | 26.2   |\n\nDemographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set with having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy (including expectations of future improvements), plan experience and other relevant data. These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans. The years of life expectancy for 2020 above have been translated from the following tables:\n\nUK: Standard life expectancy tables Series S3, adjusted to reflect the experience of our plan members analysed as part of the 2019 actuarial valuation.  Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the core CMI 2018 Mortality Projections Model with a 1.0% p.a. longterm improvement rate.\n\nNetherlands: The Dutch Actuarial Society's AG Prognosetafel 2020 table is used with correction factors (2020) to allow for the typically longer life expectancy for fund members relative to the general population. This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.\n\nThe remaining defined benefit plans are considered immaterial. Their assumptions vary due to a number of factors including the currency and longterm economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.",

The fair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets. The Group uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk - the degree of this hedging of liabilities was 70% for interest rate and 70% for inflation for the UK plan and 33% for interest rate and 20% for inflation for the Netherlands plan. Foreign currency exposures in part are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Assets included in the Other category are cash and insurance contracts which are also unquoted assets.\n\nEquity securities include Unilever securities amounting to \u20ac9 million (0.04% of total plan assets) and \u20ac12 million (0.05% of total plan assets) at 31 December 2020 and 2019 respectively. Property includes property occupied by Unilever amounting to \u20ac29 million and \u20ac30 million at 31 December 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nThe pension assets above exclude the assets in a Special Benefits Trust amounting to \u20ac44 million (2019: \u20ac54 million) to fund pension and similar obligations in the United States (see also note 17A on page 157).\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe sensitivity of the overall pension liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are:\n\n|                                      | Change in assumption   | UK   | Netherlands   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|------|---------------|---------|\n| Discount rate                        | Increase by 0.5%       | -8%  | -9%           | -8%     |\n| Inflation rate                       | Increase by 0.5%       | 6%   | 9%            | 6%      |\n| Life expectancy                      | Increase by 1 year     | 5%   | 5%            | 5%      |\n| Long-term medical cost inflation (a) | Increase by 1.0%       | 0%   | 0%            | 3%      |\n\nChange in liabilities\n\n(a)  Long-term medical cost inflation only relates to post-retirement medical plans and its impact on these liabilities.\n\nAn equivalent decrease in each assumption would have an equal and opposite impact on liabilities.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous period.",

Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe fair value of awards at grant date is calculated using observable market price. This value is expensed over their vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity. The expense is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of awards expected to vest, except where this arises from a failure to meet a market condition. Any cancellations are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares and other share awards. Following Unification (see note 1 for more information on Unification), all continuing plans are now awarded in shares of PLC, and awards and rights under plans in existence at the time of Unification have been converted into awards and rights over PLC shares. Unification does not result in modification to the previously granted awards, any shares that vest will be PLC shares.\n\nThe numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 103 and those for key management shown in note 4A on page 122. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.\n\nThe charge in each of the last three years is shown below, and relates to equity-settled plans:\n\n| Income statement charge   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   | \u20ac million 2018   |\n|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Performance share plans   | (98)             | (142)            | (183)            |\n| Other plans               | (10)             | (9)              | (13)             |\n|                           | (108)            | (151)            | (196)            |\n\n## Performance share plans\n\nPerformance share awards are made in respect of the Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP). Awards for the Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP) were last made in February 2018 and vested in February 2021. No further MCIP or GSIP awards will be made. The awards of each plan will vest between 0 and 200% of grant level, subject to the level of satisfaction of performance measures (limits for Executive Directors may vary, and are detailed in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 103).\n\nThe MCIP allowed Unilever's managers to invest up to 100% of their annual bonus (a minimum of 33% and maximum of 67% for Executive Directors) in shares in Unilever, and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares. The performance measures for MCIP are underlying sales growth, underlying EPS growth, return on invested capital and sustainability progress index for the Group. MCIP awards made will vest after four years.\n\nUnder the GSIP, Unilever's managers received annual awards of PLC shares. The performance measures for GSIP are underlying sales growth, underlying operating margin, and cumulative operating cash flow for the Group.

At 31 December 2019 shares in NV and PLC totalling 11,944,106 were outstanding in respect of share-based compensation plans of NV, PLC and its subsidiaries, including North American plans.\n\nShortly before Unification, 4,523,367 NV and PLC ordinary shares, 892,155 NV NYRSs and 468,989 PLC ADSs held by NV in connection with share-based compensation plans were transferred to an employee share ownership trust that will satisfy the awards granted. At 31 December 2020 the employee share ownership trust held 5,884,511 PLC shares and PLC and its subsidiaries held 1,382,155 PLC shares which are held as treasury shares. At 31 December 2019 PLC and NV shares totalling 12,419,009 were held by NV as treasury shares. In the future either the employee share ownership trust or subsidiaries of PLC will buy PLC shares in the open market to satisfy share-based payment obligations.\n\nThe book value of \u20ac483 million of the shares held by the trust and by Unilever PLC and its subsidiaries in respect of share-based compensation plans is eliminated on consolidation by deduction from other reserves (2019: \u20ac640 million of shares were held as treasury shares by NV). Their market value at 31 December 2020 was \u20ac357 million (2019: \u20ac635 million).\n\nShares held to satisfy awards are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation'. All differences between the purchase price of the shares held to satisfy awards granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves.\n\nBetween 31 December 2020 and 23 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), nil shares were granted, 2,232,282 shares vested and 43,435 shares were forfeited related to the Performance Share Plans.\n\n## 5. Net finance costs\n\nNet finance costs are comprised of finance costs and finance income, including net finance costs in relation to pensions and similar obligations.\n\nFinance income includes income on cash and cash equivalents and income on other financial assets. Finance costs include interest costs in relation to financial liabilities. This includes interest on lease liabilities which represents the unwind of the discount rate applied to lease liabilities.\n\nBorrowing costs are recognised based on the effective interest method.\n\n| Net finance costs                                                                  | Notes   | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   | \u20ac million 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Finance costs                                                                      |         | (672)            | (821)            | (718)            |\n| Bank loans and overdrafts                                                          |         | (32)             | (46)             | (44)             |\n| Interest on bonds and other loans (a)                                              |         | (533)            | (617)            | (560)            |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                      |         | (82)             | (100)            | (127)            |\n| Net gain/(loss) on transactions for which hedge accounting is not applied          |         | (25)             | (58)             | 13               |\n| On foreign exchange derivatives                                                    |         | 275              | (321)            | 144              |\n| Exchange difference on underlying items (b)                                        |         | (300)            | 263              | (131)            |\n| Finance income (c)                                                                 |         | 232              | 224              | 135              |\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                                   | 4B      | (9)              | (30)             | (25)             |\n| Net finance costs before non-underlying items (d)                                  |         | (449)            | (627)            | (608)            |\n| Interest related to the UK tax audit of intangible income and centralised services | 3       | (56)             | -                | -                |\n|                                                                                    |         | (505)            | (627)            | (608)            |",

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nCurrent tax in the consolidated income statement will differ from the income tax paid in the consolidated cash flow statement primarily because of deferred tax arising on temporary differences and payment dates for income tax occurring after the balance sheet date.\n\nUnilever is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years with respect to transactions already undertaken. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice. The provision is estimated based on one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum of the probability weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes) or the single most likely amount method, depending on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\n| Tax charge in income statement                                | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   | \u20ac million 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Current tax                                                   |                  |                  |                  |\n| Current year                                                  | (2,128)          | (2,098)          | (2,647)          |\n| Over/(under) provided in prior years                          | (154)            | 119              | (10)             |\n|                                                               | (2,282)          | (1,979)          | (2,657)          |\n| Deferred tax                                                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences             | 344              | (255)            | 5                |\n| Changes in tax rates                                          | (19)             | (59)             | (12)             |\n| Recognition of previously unrecognised losses brought forward | 34               | 30               | 92               |\n|                                                               | 359              | (284)            | 85               |\n|                                                               | (1,923)          | (2,263)          | (2,572)          |\n\nThe reconciliation between the computed weighted average rate of income tax expense, which is generally applicable to Unilever companies, and the actual rate of taxation charged is as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of effective tax rate                                                 | % 2020   | % 2019   | % 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Computed rate of tax (a)                                                             | 23       | 24       | 25       |\n| Differences between computed rate of tax and effective tax rate due to:              |          |          |          |\n| Incentive tax credits                                                                | (2)      | (2)      | (3)      |\n| Withholding tax on dividends                                                         | 2        | 3        | 2        |\n| Expenses not deductible for tax purposes                                             | 1        | 1        | 1        |\n| Irrecoverable withholding tax                                                        | 1        | 1        | 1        |\n| Income tax reserve adjustments - current and prior year                              | (1)      | -        | 1        |\n| Transfer to/(from) unrecognised deferred tax assets                                  | -        | (2)      | -        |\n| Others                                                                               | (1)      | 1        | (1)      |\n| Underlying effective tax rate                                                        | 23       | 26       | 26       |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit (b)                                     | -        | -        | (1)      |\n| Taxes related to the UK tax audit of intangible income and centralised  services (b) | 1        | -        | -        |\n| Impact of Spreads disposal (b)                                                       | -        | -        | (4)      |\n| Taxes related to the reorganisation of our European business (b)                     | 1        | 2        | -        |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                   | 25       | 28       | 21       |\n\nOur tax rate is reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment. The tax rate is increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense and by irrecoverable withholding taxes on dividends paid by subsidiary companies and on other cross-border payments such as royalties and service fees, which cannot be offset against other taxes due. Uncertain tax provisions including the related interest and penalties amounted to \u20ac879 million (2019: \u20ac787 million). In 2020, a provision of \u20ac186 million was established in respect of the tax amortisation of intangible assets, including goodwill, related to Horlicks in India. Our expectation is that we will continue to provide for this until the matter is resolved. We note that the Indian budget on 1 February 2021 includes a proposal to exclude goodwill from the definition of tax depreciable assets effective 1 April 2020. If this were enacted \u20ac59 million of the provision would no longer be required with no material impact on the income statement.\n\nThe Group's future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by several factors, including changes in tax laws and their interpretation and the continuing OECD international tax reform work, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and any restructuring of our businesses.",

Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group. Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 goodwill not deductible for tax purposes;\n- \u25a0 the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and\n- \u25a0 differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n| Movements in 2020 and 2019       | \u20ac million As at  1 January 2020   | \u20ac million Income statement   | \u20ac million Other   | \u20ac million As at  31 December 2020   | \u20ac million As at  1 January 2019   | \u20ac million Income statement   | \u20ac million Other   | \u20ac million As at  31 December 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Pensions and similar obligations | 272                               | (97)                         | (95)              | 80                                  | 404                               | (81)                         | (51)              | 272                                 |\n| Provisions and accruals          | 756                               | 38                           | (96)              | 698                                 | 821                               | (73)                         | 8                 | 756                                 |\n| Goodwill and intangible assets   | (2,096)                           | 23                           | (661)             | (2,734)                             | (1,911)                           | (31)                         | (154)             | (2,096)                             |\n| Accelerated tax depreciation     | (685)                             | 9                            | 35                | (641)                               | (679)                             | 12                           | (18)              | (685)                               |\n| Tax losses                       | 184                               | 32                           | (26)              | 190                                 | 130                               | 63                           | (9)               | 184                                 |\n| Fair value gains                 | (50)                              | 12                           | (14)              | (52)                                | 155                               | (200)                        | (5)               | (50)                                |\n| Fair value losses                | 15                                | (6)                          | 36                | 45                                  | 22                                | (2)                          | (5)               | 15                                  |\n| Share-based payments             | 156                               | (30)                         | 20                | 146                                 | 175                               | (39)                         | 20                | 156                                 |\n| Lease liability                  | 319                               | 9                            | (34)              | 294                                 | 428                               | (113)                        | 4                 | 319                                 |\n| Right of use asset               | (269)                             | (4)                          | 29                | (244)                               | (370)                             | 107                          | (6)               | (269)                               |\n| Other (a)                        | 161                               | 373                          | (8)               | 526                                 | 77                                | 73                           | 11                | 161                                 |\n|                                  | (1,237)                           | 359                          | (814)             | (1,692)                             | (748)                             | (284)                        | (205)             | (1,237)                             |\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of \u20ac4,808 million (2019: \u20ac4,790 million) and tax credits amounting to \u20ac454 million (2019: \u20ac524 million) available for offset against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of \u20ac4,246 million (2019: \u20ac4,272 million) and tax credits of \u20ac429 million (2019: \u20ac497 million), as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses and credits can be utilised. Of these losses \u20ac4,195 million (2019: \u20ac4,108 million) have expiry dates, the majority being corporate income tax losses in the Netherlands which expire between now and 2027.\n\nDeferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of other deductible temporary differences of \u20ac1,445 million (2019: \u20ac48 million) as it is not expected they will be utilised. Of these differences \u20ac1,193 million relates to limitation on the deduction of interest expenses. There is no expiry date for these differences.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was \u20ac2,097 million (2019: \u20ac2,476 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Movements in 2020 and 2019                                                | Assets 2020   | Assets 2019   | Liabilities 2020   | Liabilities 2019   | Total 2020   | \u20ac million Total 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                          | 404           | 402           | (324)              | (130)              | 80           | 272                    |\n| Provisions and accruals                                                   | 408           | 495           | 290                | 261                | 698          | 756                    |\n| Goodwill and intangible assets                                            | 330           | 248           | (3,064)            | (2,344)            | (2,734)      | (2,096)                |\n| Accelerated tax depreciation                                              | (37)          | (67)          | (604)              | (618)              | (641)        | (685)                  |\n| Tax losses                                                                | 161           | 153           | 29                 | 31                 | 190          | 184                    |\n| Fair value gains                                                          | (1)           | (14)          | (51)               | (36)               | (52)         | (50)                   |\n| Fair value losses                                                         | 27            | -             | 18                 | 15                 | 45           | 15                     |\n| Share-based payments                                                      | 26            | 31            | 120                | 125                | 146          | 156                    |\n| Lease liability                                                           | 157           | 170           | 137                | 149                | 294          | 319                    |\n| Right of use asset                                                        | (128)         | (142)         | (116)              | (127)              | (244)        | (269)                  |\n| Other                                                                     | 127           | 60            | 399                | 101                | 526          | 161                    |\n|                                                                           | 1,474         | 1,336         | (3,166)            | (2,573)            | (1,692)      | (1,237)                |\n| Of which deferred tax to be recovered/(settled) after more than 12 months | 1,230         | 1,030         | (3,311)            | (2,681)            | (2,081)      | (1,651)                |",

Combined earnings per share\n\nThe combined earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the combined ordinary shares of NV and PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury shares.\n\nIn calculating diluted earnings per share and underlying earnings per share, a number of adjustments are made to the number of shares, principally, the exercise of share plans by employees.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items in operating profit and any other significant unusual items within net profit but not operating profit.\n\nEarnings per share for total operations for the 12 months were as follows:\n\n|                               |   \u20ac   2020 |   \u20ac 2019 |   \u20ac   2018 |\n|-------------------------------|------------|----------|------------|\n| Basic earnings per share      |       2.13 |     2.15 |       3.49 |\n| Diluted earnings per share    |       2.12 |     2.14 |       3.48 |\n| Underlying earnings per share |       2.48 |     2.55 |       2.35 |\n\n|                                                                                       | Millions of share units   | Millions of share units   | Millions of share units   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Calculation of average number of share units (a)                                      | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Average number of shares: PLC                                                         | 1,351.1                   | 1,175.5                   | 1,264.0                   |\n| NV                                                                                    | 1,278.1                   | 1,598.0                   | 1,714.7                   |\n| Less treasury shares held by employee share trusts and companies                      | (8.9)                     | (157.0)                   | (295.4)                   |\n| Average number of shares - used for basic earnings per share                          | 2,620.3                   | 2,616.5                   | 2,683.3                   |\n| Add dilutive effect of share-based compensation plans                                 | 9.5                       | 10.2                      | 11.5                      |\n| Diluted average number of shares - used for diluted and underlying earnings per share | 2,629.8                   | 2,626.7                   | 2,694.8                   |\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Calculation of earnings                                                                          | Notes   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Net profit                                                                                       |         | 6,073  | 6,026  | 9,788   |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                        |         | (492)  | (401)  | (419)   |\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders' equity - used for basic and diluted earnings  per share |         | 5,581  | 5,625  | 9,369   |\n| Post tax impact of non-underlying items                                                          | 3       | 951    | 1,063  | (3,024) |\n| Underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity - used for underlying earnings  per share |         | 6,532  | 6,688  | 6,345   |",

Dividends on ordinary capital\n\nDividends are recognised on the date that the shareholder's right to receive payment is established. This is generally the date when the dividend is declared.\n\n| Dividends on ordinary capital during the year   | \u20ac million   2020   | \u20ac million 2019   | \u20ac million   2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| PLC dividends                                   | (1,911)            | (1,871)          | (1,819)            |\n| NV dividends (a)                                | (2,389)            | (2,352)          | (2,262)            |\n|                                                 | (4,300)            | (4,223)          | (4,081)            |\n\nFour quarterly interim dividends were declared and paid during 2020 totalling \u20ac1.64 (2019: \u20ac1.62) per NV ordinary share and \u00a31.45 (2019: \u00a31.42) per PLC ordinary share.\n\nA quarterly dividend of \u20ac1,125 million (2019: \u20ac1,073 million) was declared on 4 February 2021, to be paid in March 2021; \u00a30.38 per PLC ordinary share (2019: \u00a30.35). Total dividends declared in relation to 2020 were \u00a31.48 (2019: \u00a31.43) per PLC ordinary share.\n\n## 9. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations (see note 21). Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment.\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is assessed to determine whether new cash generating units are created, and if not, is allocated to the Group's CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. These might not always be the same as the CGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than an operating segment.\n\nThe Group has ten cash generating units (CGUs) based on the three geographical areas and three divisions as well as a health and wellbeing CGU which was recognised in 2019 following the acquisition of the OLLY business.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nSeparately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at the date of acquisition. On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.\n\nExpenditure to support development of internally-produced intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIndefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands, for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows. These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support. These assets are not amortised but are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\nFinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise software, patented and non-patented technology, know-how and customer lists. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.",

No impairment was identified. In 2019, a \u20ac18 million charge was recognised in non-underlying items within the 'impairments' line (see note 3 on pages 121 and 122). This related to goodwill of a local business classified to held for sale.\n\n2,407\n\n4,244\n\n-\n\n(31)\n\n6,620\n\nFinite-life intangible assets\n\nTotal\n\n(a)",

The growth rates and operating margins used to estimate cash flows for the first five years are based on past performance and on the Group's three-year strategic plan, which includes the impact on our business of climate change and activities we are undertaking to reduce carbon emissions, extended to years four and five.\n\nThe estimated cash flows after year five are extrapolated using a longer-term sustainable growth rate, which is determined as the lower of our own three-year average market growth projection and external forecasts for the relevant market.\n\nIn 2020, the projected cash flows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates in the range between 6.0%-7.4% (2019: 7.4%). The discount rates are specific to each CGU and are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital, including a market risk premium.\n\nThere are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of a CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.",

        "page_content": "## 10. Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group's property, plant and equipment is comprised of owned assets (note 10A) and leased assets (note 10B). Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary. If an indication of impairment exists, the asset's or cash generating unit's recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\n## Owned assets\n\nOwned assets are initially measured at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets. Residual values are reviewed at least annually. Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 freehold buildings (no depreciation on freehold land)\n\n40 years\n\n- \u25a0 leasehold land and buildings\n- \u25a0 plant and equipment\n\n## Leased assets\n\nThe cost of a leased asset is measured as the lease liability at inception of the lease contract and other direct costs less any incentives granted by the lessor. The Group has not capitalised leases which are less than 12 months or leases of low value assets.

The Group leases land and buildings for manufacturing, warehouse facilities and office space and also sublets some property. Plant and equipment includes leases for vehicles.\n\nThe Group has recognised in the income statement, a charge of \u20ac96 million (2019: \u20ac97 million) for short-term leases and \u20ac77 million (2019: \u20ac79 million) on leases for low-value assets.\n\nDuring the year, the Group recognised an income of \u20ac19 million (2019: \u20ac25 million) from sublet properties.\n\nCash flows: The total cash outflows for leases was \u20ac525 million (2019: \u20ac534 million).\n\nLease liabilities: Lease liabilities are shown in note 15 on pages 143 and 147.\n\n## 11. Other non-current assets\n\nJoint ventures are undertakings in which the Group has an interest and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other parties. Associates are undertakings where the Group has an investment in which it does not have control or joint control but can exercise significant influence.\n\nInterests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, adjusted for the movement in the Group's share of their net assets and liabilities. The Group's share of the profit or loss after tax of joint ventures and associates is included in the Group's consolidated profit before taxation.\n\nWhere the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in the equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nBiological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell with any changes recognised in the income statement.\n\n|                                           |   \u20ac million   2020 |   \u20ac million 2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Interest in net assets of joint ventures  |                 29 |               35 |\n| Interest in net assets of associates      |                 34 |               37 |\n| Long-term trade and other receivables (a) |                465 |              380 |\n| Fair value of biological assets           |                 12 |               17 |\n| Other non-current assets (b)              |                391 |              184 |\n|                                           |                931 |              653 |",

Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n| Inventories                         | \u20ac million   2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Raw materials and consumables       | 1,523              | 1,399            |\n| Finished goods and goods for resale | 3,223              | 3,053            |\n| Total inventories                   | 4,746              | 4,452            |\n| Provision for inventories           | (284)              | (288)            |\n|                                     | 4,462              | 4,164            |\n\n| Provisions for inventories   | \u20ac million   2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| 1 January                    | 288                | 205              |\n| Charge to income statement   | 116                | 153              |\n| Reduction/releases           | (97)               | (71)             |\n| Currency translations        | (26)               | -                |\n| Others (a)                   | 3                  | 1                |\n| 31 December                  | 284                | 288              |\n\n(a)  Others include the amount relating to the acquisition/disposal of businesses.\n\nInventories with a value of \u20ac204 million (2019: \u20ac159 million) are carried at net realisable value, this being lower than cost.

Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses. Discounts payable to customers are shown as a reduction in trade receivables when there is a legal right and intent to settle them on a net basis.\n\nWe do not consider the fair values of trade and other current receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Group's customer base being large and diverse. Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. Impairment for trade receivables are calculated for specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery and for balances past due with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant forward-looking information.\n\n| Trade and other current receivables   | \u20ac million   2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Due within one year                   |                    |                  |\n| Trade receivables (a)                 | 3,433              | 4,916            |\n| Prepayments and accrued income        | 423                | 579              |\n| Other receivables                     | 1,083              | 1,200            |\n|                                       | 4,939              | 6,695            |\n\nIncluded within trade receivables are discounts due to our customers of \u20ac2,082 million (2019: \u20ac2,423 million).

Trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement depends on the type of liability:\n\n- \u25a0 accruals are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method;\n- \u25a0 social security and sundry taxes are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method;\n- \u25a0 deferred consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in the income statement as explained below; and\n- \u25a0 others are subsequently measured either at amortised cost, using the effective interest method or at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Deferred Consideration\n\nDeferred consideration represents any payments to the sellers of a business that occur after the acquisition date. These typically comprise contingent consideration and fixed deferred consideration:\n\n- \u25a0 fixed deferred consideration is a payment with a due date after acquisition that is not dependent on future conditions; and\n- \u25a0 contingent consideration is a payment which is dependent on certain conditions being met in the future and is often variable.\n\nAll deferred consideration is initially recognised at fair value as at the acquisition date, which includes a present value discount. Subsequently, deferred consideration is measured to reflect the unwinding of discount on the liability, with changes recognised in finance cost within the income statement. In the balance sheet it is remeasured to reflect the latest estimate of the achievement of the conditions on which the consideration is based; changes in value other than the discount unwind are recognised as acquisition and disposal-related costs within non-underlying items in the income statement.\n\nWe do not consider the fair values of trade payables and other liabilities to be significantly different from their carrying values.\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Trade payables and other liabilities       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current: due within one year               |        |        |\n| Trade payables (a)                         | 8,375  | 9,190  |\n| Accruals                                   | 4,266  | 4,153  |\n| Social security and sundry taxes           | 401    | 507    |\n| Deferred consideration                     | 43     | 39     |\n| Others                                     | 1,047  | 879    |\n|                                            | 14,132 | 14,768 |\n| Non-current: due after more than one year  |        |        |\n| Accruals                                   | 81     | 117    |\n| Deferred consideration                     | 121    | 169    |\n| Others                                     | 33     | 53     |\n|                                            | 235    | 339    |\n| Total trade payables and other liabilities | 14,367 | 15,107 |\n\nIncluded within trade payables and other liabilities are discounts due to our customers of \u20ac1,770 million (2019: \u20ac1,053 million). The increase from 2019 is primarily driven by differences in the timing of promotional activities and the settlement of customer invoices compared to last year.\n\nIncluded within others are IT and consulting services.\n\n## Deferred Consideration\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the total balance of deferred consideration for acquisitions is \u20ac164 million (2019: \u20ac208 million), which includes contingent consideration of \u20ac140 million (2019: \u20ac154 million). These contingent consideration payments are dependent on acquired businesses achieving contractually agreed financial targets (mainly relates to cumulative increases in turnover and profit before tax) and fall due up until 2025, with a maximum contractual amount of \u20ac718 million.\n\n## Supplier financing arrangements for trade payables\n\nSome of our suppliers elect to factor some of their receivables from the Group with financial institutions. In some instances we provide suppliers and/ or banks with visibility of invoices approved for payment, which helps them receive cash from the bank before the invoice due date, if they choose to do so. Payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to factor their receivable. If a receivable is purchased by a third party bank, that third party bank does not benefit from additional security when compared to the security originally enjoyed by the supplier. The Group evaluates these arrangements to assess if the payable holds the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as a financial liability. At 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 all such liabilities were classified as trade payables.",

Full details of these plans are given in note 4C on pages 129 and 130.\n\n## Unification reserve\n\nThe Group recognised a separate Unification Reserve within Equity as a result of PLC Share Premium that arose from Unification.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves include the fair value reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, the capital redemption reserve and treasury shares.\n\n## Shares held by employee share trusts and group companies\n\nAn employee share trust and group companies purchase and hold shares to satisfy performance shares granted and other share awards (see note 4C). The assets and liabilities of the trust and shares held by the trust and group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements. The book value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and the trust's borrowings are included in the Group's liabilities. The costs of the trust are included in the results of the Group. The shares held by the trust and group companies are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs. When bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship in those cases bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss. Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the exception of:\n\n- \u25a0 financial liabilities which the Group has elected to measure at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u25a0 derivative financial liabilities - see note 16 on page 149; and\n- \u25a0 contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not yet paid at the start of the lease term. This is discounted using an appropriate borrowing rate determined by the Group, where none is readily available in the lease contract. The lease liability is subsequently reduced by cash payments and increased by interest costs. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group assesses that there will be a change in the amount expected to be paid during the lease term.\n\nThe Group's Treasury activities are designed to:\n\n- \u25a0 maintain a competitive balance sheet in line with at least A/A2 rating (see below);\n- \u25a0 secure funding at lowest costs for the Group's operations, M&A activity and external dividend payments (see below);\n- \u25a0 protect the Group's financial results and position from financial risks (see note 16);\n- \u25a0 maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns (see note 16); and\n- \u25a0 protect the Group's financial investments, while maximising returns (see note 17)\n\nThe Treasury department provides central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services for the Group's operations. The department is governed by standards and processes which are approved by Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance is monitored closely by senior management. Reviews are undertaken periodically by corporate audit.\n\nKey instruments used by the treasury department are:\n\n- \u25a0 short-term and long-term borrowings;\n- \u25a0 cash and cash equivalents; and\n- \u25a0 plain vanilla derivatives, including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nThe Treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.\n\nUnilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital:\n\n- \u25a0 total equity - retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests (notes 15A and 15B);\n- \u25a0 short-term debt - current financial liabilities (note 15C); and\n- \u25a0 long-term debt - non-current financial liabilities (note 15C).\n\nThe Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group is based on management's judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.\n\nOur current long-term credit rating is A+/A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1/P1. We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A/A2 in the long term. This provides us with:\n\n- \u25a0 appropriate access to the debt and equity markets;\n- \u25a0 sufficient flexibility for acquisitions;\n- \u25a0 sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity; and\n- \u25a0 optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.\n\nUnilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies. This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.",

The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.\n\n## (i) Fair value hedges (a)\n\nCertain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan. In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship. The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement. Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement. The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective. Ineffectiveness may occur if the critical terms do not exactly match, or if there is a value adjustment resulting from a change in credit risk (in either the Group or the counter-party to the derivative) that is not matched by the hedged item. When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedges (a)\n\nDerivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows. Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships. For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity. Cost of hedging, where material and opted for, is recorded in a separate account within equity. Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement. Ineffectiveness may occur if there are changes to the expected timing of the hedged transaction. If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset. For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.\n\nWhen a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs. When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.\n\n## (iii) Net investment hedges (a)\n\nCertain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Group's investment in foreign subsidiaries. The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.\n\n## (iv) Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied\n\nDerivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures. No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.\n\n- (a)   Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for both 2020 and 2019. Fair value changes on basis spread is recorded in a separate account within equity.\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections:\n\n- \u25a0 liquidity risk (see note 16A);\n- \u25a0 market risk (see note 16B); and\n- \u25a0 credit risk (see note 17B).\n\nThe Group's risk management framework is established to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to maintain adherence to these limits.\n\n## 16A. Management of liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Group's credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Group's ability to raise funds.\n\nThe Group's funding strategy was supported by cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances. Surplus cash balance have been invested conservatively with low risk counter-parties at maturities of less than six months. In its liquidity assessment the Group does not consider any supplier financing arrangements as these arrangements are non-recourse to Unilever and supplier payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to use such financing arrangements.\n\nCash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes. In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.\n\nOn 31 December 2020 Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of $7,965 million (2019: $7,865 million) with a 364-day term out. As part of the regular annual process, the intention is that these facilities will again be renewed in 2021.",

Management of market risk\n\nUnilever's size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u25a0 commodity price risk;\n- \u25a0 currency risk; and\n- \u25a0 interest rate risk.\n\nThe above risks may affect the Group's income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of the Group's management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.\n\nWhere the Group uses hedge accounting to mitigate the above risks, it is normally implemented centrally by either the Treasury or Commodity Risk Management teams, in line with their respective frameworks and strategies. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship continues to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group generally enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the hedged item, meaning that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is evident, so only a qualitative assessment is performed. When a qualitative assessment is not considered sufficient, for example when the critical terms of the hedging instrument do not match exactly with the hedged item, a quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness will also be performed. The hedge ratio is set on inception for all hedge relationships and is dependent on the alignment of the critical terms of the hedging instrument to the hedged item (in most instances these are matched, so the hedge ratio is 1:1).\n\nThe Group's exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below. It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 16C.\n\n## Potential impact of risk\n\n## (i) Commodity price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices in relation to its purchase of certain raw materials.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group had hedged its exposure to future commodity purchases with commodity derivatives valued at \u20ac276 million (2019: \u20ac439 million).\n\nHedges of future commodity purchases resulted in cumulative losses of \u20ac89 million (2019: losses of \u20ac52 million ) being reclassified to the income statement and losses of \u20ac66 million (2019: losses of \u20ac28 million) being recognised as a basis adjustment to inventory purchased.\n\n## Management policy and hedging strategy\n\nThe Group uses commodity forwards, futures, swaps and option contracts to hedge against this risk. All commodity forward contracts hedge future purchases of raw materials and the contracts are settled either in cash or by physical delivery.\n\nThe Group also hedges risk, components of commodities where it is not possible to hedge the commodity in full. This is done with reference to the contract to purchase the hedged commodity.\n\nCommodity derivatives are generally designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge accounting relations. All commodity derivative contracts are done in line with approvals from the Global Commodity Executive which is chaired by the Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer (CSCO) or the Global Commodity Operating Team which is chaired by the Chief Procurement Officer.\n\n## Sensitivity to the risk\n\n- A 10% increase in commodity prices as at 31 December 2020 would have led to a \u20ac35 million gain on the commodity derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve (2019: \u20ac56 million gain in the cash flow hedge reserve).\n\nA decrease of 10% in commodity prices on a full-year basis would have the equal but opposite effect.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group continued\n\n## Potential impact of risk\n\n## (ii) Currency risk\n\n## Currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings\n\nBecause of Unilever's global reach, it is subject to the risk that changes in foreign currency values impact the Group's sales, purchases and borrowings.\n\nThe Group manages the foreign currency risk by hedging forecasted sales and purchase transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12-month period through layered hedging.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the exposure to the Group from companies holding financial assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency amounted to \u20ac274 million (2019: \u20ac317 million).\n\n## Currency risk on the Group's net investments\n\nThe Group is also subject to currency risk in relation to the translation of the net investments of its foreign operations into euros for inclusion in its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese net investments include Group financial loans, which are monetary items that form part of our net investment in foreign operations, of \u20ac9.2 billion (2019: \u20ac7.6 billion), of which \u20ac5.5 billion (2019: \u20ac3.5 billion) is denominated in GBP. In accordance with IAS 21, the exchange differences on these financial loans are booked through reserves.\n\nPart of the currency exposure on the Group's investments is also managed using US$ net investment hedges with a nominal value of \u20ac4.0 billion (2019: \u20ac4.0 billion) for US$.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the net exposure of the net investments in foreign currencies amounts to \u20ac24.6 billion (2019: \u20ac22.0 billion).\n\n## Management policy and hedging strategy\n\nThe Group manages currency exposures within prescribed limits, mainly through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts.\n\nOperating companies manage foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits.\n\nThe aim of the Group's approach to management of currency risk is to leave the Group with no material residual risk. This aim has been achieved in all years presented.\n\nUnilever aims to minimise this currency risk on the Group's net investment exposure by borrowing in local currency in the operating companies themselves. In some locations, however, the Group's ability to do this is inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or by local market conditions.\n\nWhere the residual risk from these countries exceeds prescribed limits, Treasury may decide on a case-by-case basis to actively hedge the exposure. This is done either through additional borrowings in the related currency, or through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nWhere local currency borrowings, or forward contracts, are used to hedge the currency risk in relation to the Group's net investment in foreign subsidiaries, these relationships are designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nExchange risk related to the principal amount of the US$ denominated debt either forms part of hedging relationship itself, or is hedged through forward contracts.\n\n## Sensitivity to the risk\n\nAs an estimation of the approximate impact of the residual risk, with respect to financial instruments, the Group has calculated the impact of a 10% change in exchange rates.\n\n## Impact on income statement\n\nA 10% strengthening of the respective functional currencies of group companies against the foreign currencies would have led to an additional \u20ac27 million gain in the income statement (2019: \u20ac32 million gain).\n\nA 10% weakening of the respective functional currencies of group companies against the foreign currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\nAs at year end, the Group had the below notional amount of currency derivatives outstanding to which cash flow hedge accounting is applied:\n\n| Currency   | 2020    | 2019   |\n|------------|---------|--------|\n| EUR*       | (920)   | (743)  |\n| GBP        | (414)   | (325)  |\n| USD        | 588     | 640    |\n| SEK        | (100)   | (94)   |\n| CAD        | (110)   | (108)  |\n| PLN        | (70)    | (67)   |\n| Others     | (176)   | (192)  |\n| Total      | (1,202) | (889)  |\n\n- *  Euro exposure relates to group companies having non-euro functional currencies.\n\n## Impact on equity - trade-related cash flow hedges\n\nA 10% strengthening of foreign currencies against the respective functional currencies of group companies hedging future trade cash flows and applying cash flow hedge accounting, would have led to \u20ac120 million loss (2019: \u20ac89 million loss).\n\nA 10% weakening of the same would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - net investment hedges\n\nA 10% strengthening of the euro against other currencies would have led to a \u20ac404 million (2019: \u20ac396 million) loss on the net investment hedges used to manage the currency exposure on the Group's investments.\n\nA 10% weakening of the euro against other currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - net investments in group companies\n\nA 10% strengthening of the euro against all other currencies would have led to a \u20ac2,461 million negative retranslation effect (2019: \u20ac2,203 million negative retranslation effect).\n\nA 10% weakening of the euro against all other currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect. In line with accepted hedge accounting treatment and our accounting policy for financial loans, the retranslation differences would be recognised in equity.",

The Group's ability to manage interest costs also has an impact on reported results.\n\nThe Group does not have any material floating interest bearing financial assets or any significant long-term fixed interest bearing financial assets. Consequently the Group's interest rate risk arises mainly from financial liabilities other than lease liabilities.\n\nTaking into account the impact of interest rate swaps, at 31 December 2020, interest rates were fixed on approximately 87% of the expected financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) for 2021, and 75% for 2022 (82% for 2020 and 73% for 2021 at 31 December 2019).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had USD 3,700 million (2019: USD 4,500 million) of outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps (on which cash flow hedge accounting is applied).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had USD 500 million (2019: Nil) of outstanding fixed to float interest rate swaps (on which fair value hedge accounting is applied).\n\nThe carrying amount of the hedged item recognised under 'Bond and other loans' is \u20ac395 million (2019: Nil), which includes accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustment of \u20ac(10) million (2019: Nil).\n\nFor interest management purposes, transactions with a maturity shorter than six months from inception date are not included as fixed interest transactions.\n\nThe average interest rate on short-term borrowings in 2020 was 1.6% (2019: 2.5%).\n\n(a)  See the weighted average amount of financial liabilities with fixed rate interest shown in the following table.\n\nThe following table shows the split in fixed and floating-rate interest exposures, taking into account the impact of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps:\n\n|                                                                       | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Current financial liabilities                                         | (4,461)          | (4,691)          |\n| Non-current financial liabilities                                     | (22,844)         | (23,566)         |\n| Total financial liabilities                                           | (27,305)         | (28,257)         |\n| Less: lease liabilities                                               | (1,771)          | (1,919)          |\n| Financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities)                   | (25,534)         | (26,338)         |\n| Of which:                                                             |                  |                  |\n| Fixed rate (weighted average amount of fixing for the following year) | (21,561)         | (22,618)         |\n\n## Management policy and hedging strategy\n\nUnilever's interest rate management approach aims for an optimal balance between fixed and floating-rate interest rate exposures on expected financial liabilities. The objective of this approach is to minimise annual interest costs.\n\nThis is achieved either by issuing fixed or floating-rate long-term debt, or by modifying interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe majority of the Group's existing interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and are expected to be effective. The fair value movement of these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.\n\n## Sensitivity to the risk\n\n## Impact on income statement\n\nAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2020 would have led to an additional \u20ac40 million of finance cost (2019: \u20ac37 million additional finance costs).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on a full-year basis would have an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - cash flow hedges\n\nAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2020 would have led to an additional \u20ac11 million credit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2019: \u20ac8 million credit).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in interest rates on a full-year basis would have led to an additional \u20ac12 million debit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2019: \u20ac8 million debit).",

Derivatives and hedging continued\n\n## Master netting or similar agreements\n\nA number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.\n\nThe ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet. This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default.\n\nThe column 'Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet - Financial instruments' shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nThe following financial assets are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.\n\nRelated amounts not set\n\n|                             |                                                         |                                                                                       |                                                                             | off in the balance sheet          | off in the balance sheet           |                      |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2020      | \u20ac million Gross amounts of  recognised financial assets | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial assets  set off in the balance sheet | \u20ac million Net amounts of  financial assets  presented in the  balance sheet | \u20ac million Financial   instruments | \u20ac million Cash collateral received | \u20ac million Net amount |\n| Derivative financial assets | 306                                                     | (148)                                                                                 | 158                                                                         | (91)                              | (16)                               | 51                   |\n| As at 31 December 2019      |                                                         |                                                                                       |                                                                             |                                   |                                    |                      |\n| Derivative financial assets | 253                                                     | (45)                                                                                  | 208                                                                         | (130)                             | (24)                               | 54                   |\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities\n\nThe following financial liabilities are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.\n\n|                                  |                                                               |                                                                                            |                                                                                       | Related amounts not set  off in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set  off in the balance sheet   |                      |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2020           | \u20ac million Gross amounts   of recognised financial liabilities | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial liabilities  set off in the balance sheet | \u20ac million  Net amounts   of financial  liabilities   presented in the   balance sheet | \u20ac million Financial   instruments                   | \u20ac million Cash collateral received                  | \u20ac million Net amount |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (566)                                                         | 148                                                                                        | (418)                                                                                 | 91                                                  | -

Investment and return\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments. To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must:\n\n- \u25a0 be readily convertible into cash;\n- \u25a0 have an insignificant risk of changes in value; and\n- \u25a0 have a maturity period of typically three months or less at acquisition.\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u25a0 those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and\n- \u25a0 those to be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThis classification depends on our business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nAll financial assets are either debt instruments or equity instruments. Debt instruments are those that provide the Group with a contractual right to receive cash or another asset. Equity instruments are those where the Group has no contractual right to receive cash or another asset.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories that debt instruments are classified as:\n\n- \u25a0 financial assets at amortised cost;\n- \u25a0 financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; or\n- \u25a0 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (i) Amortised cost\n\nAssets measured at amortised cost are those which are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal or interest (SPPI). A gain or loss on a debt investment recognised at amortised cost on de-recognition or impairment is recognised in profit or loss. Interest income is recognised within finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal and interest and which are held to recognise a capital gain through the sale of the asset. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in profit or loss. On de-recognition, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## (iii) Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income are measured as fair value through profit or loss. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement. Interest income from these assets is included within finance income.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value. Where the Group has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss. Dividends from these investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nFinancial instruments classified as amortised cost and debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are assessed for impairment. The Group assesses the probability of default of an asset at initial recognition and then whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis.\n\nTo assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information. Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is also considered.\n\nFinancial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Impairment losses on assets classified as amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss. When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in profit or loss. Permanent impairment losses on debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss.",

These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short and long-term debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 149 to 155.\n\nThe remaining \u20ac2.5 billion (or 46%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes \u20ac98 million (2019: \u20ac146 million, 2018: \u20ac154 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.",

Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13. These risks are generally managed by local controllers. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments, including those held at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Group's treasury department. Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilever's principal counter-parties. In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party. To further reduce the Group's credit exposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilever's principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments. Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and/or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments. At 31 December 2020 the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to \u20ac18 million (2019: \u20ac24 million), of which \u20ac16 million (2019: \u20ac24 million) was in cash, and \u20ac2 million (2019: \u20acNil) was in the form of bond securities. The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nFurther details in relation to the Group's exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.\n\n## 18.

There were also no significant movements between the fair value levels since 31 December 2019.\n\nThe impact in 2020 income statement due to Level 3 instruments is a loss of \u20ac22 million (2019: loss of \u20ac9 million).\n\nReconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities is given below:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Reconciliation of movements in Level 3 valuations         | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 1 January                                                 | 373    | 241    |\n| Gains and losses recognised in income statement           | (22)   | (9)    |\n| Gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income | 75     | 43     |\n| Purchases and new issues                                  | 41     | 83     |\n| Sales and settlements                                     | 83     | 15     |\n| 31 December                                               | 550    | 373    |\n\n## Significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair values\n\nAssets valued using Level 3 techniques include \u20ac494 million (2019: \u20ac403 million) relating to a number of unlisted investments within Unilever Ventures companies, none of which are individually material; \u20ac51 million (2019: \u20acnil) for an option over a non-controlling interest; and \u20ac106 million (2019: \u20ac114 million) of long-term cash receivables under life insurance policies. Valuation techniques used are specific to each asset and for all assets a change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the value significantly.\n\n## Calculation of fair values\n\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\n## Assets and liabilities carried at fair value\n\n- \u25a0 The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.\n- \u25a0 The fair values of unquoted financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as the Monte Carlo simulation. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n- \u25a0 Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.\n- \u25a0 For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.",

Financial instruments fair value risk continued\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities (fair values for disclosure purposes only)\n\n- \u25a0 Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.\n- \u25a0 The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value.\n- \u25a0 Non-listed bonds, other loans, bank loans and non-current receivables and payables are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\n\n## Policies and processes used in relation to the calculation of level 3 fair values\n\nAssets valued using Level 3 valuation techniques are primarily made up of long-term cash receivables and unlisted investments. Valuation techniques used are specific to the circumstances involved. Unlisted investments include \u20ac494 million (2019: \u20ac403 million) of investments within Unilever Ventures companies.\n\n## 19.

The Group expects these provisions to be substantially utilised within the next few years.\n\nThe Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, along with other consumer products companies and retail customers, Unilever is involved in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities. These proceedings and investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets. Where specific issues arise, provisions are made to the extent appropriate. Due to the nature of the legal cases, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\nProvisions for Brazil indirect taxes are comprised of disputes with Brazilian authorities, in particular relating to tax credits that can be taken for the PIS and COFINS indirect taxes. These provisions are separate from the matters listed as contingent liabilities in note 20. Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters. Due to the nature of disputed indirect taxes, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\nOther includes provisions for indirect taxes in countries other than Brazil, interest on tax provisions and provisions for various other matters. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.",

It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future. Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental, so contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known maximum exposure.\n\nContingent liabilities arise in respect of litigations against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation. In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes. The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil.\n\nIn case of fiscal matters, the known maximum exposure is the amount included in a tax assessment.\n\n\u20ac million\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Summary of contingent liabilities                                  | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Corporate reorganisation - IPI, PIS and COFINS taxes and penalties | 2,040  | 2,235  |\n| Inputs for PIS and COFINS taxes                                    | 35     | 43     |\n| Goodwill amortisation                                              | 137    | 184    |\n| Other tax assessments - approximately 600 cases                    | 650    | 959    |\n| Total Brazil tax                                                   | 2,862  | 3,421  |\n| Other contingent liabilities                                       | 648    | 789    |\n| Total contingent liabilities                                       | 3,510  | 4,210  |\n\n## Brazil tax\n\nDuring 2004, and in common with many other businesses operating in Brazil, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service in respect of indirect taxes regarding corporate reorganisation. The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without a valid business purpose. The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructuring done by many companies in Brazil. The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Group's favour. However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter. Additionally, during the course of 2014 and between 2017 and 2020, other notices of infringement were issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments. The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is \u20ac2,040 million (2019: \u20ac2,235 million).\n\nThe Group believes that the likelihood that the Brazilian tax authorities will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. In each case we believe our position is strong, so they have not been provided for and are considered to be contingent liabilities. Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil, the possibility of further tax assessments related to the same matters cannot be ruled out. We expect that two of our largest tax litigation cases, which represent around \u20ac863 million of contingent liabilities, will move from the Administrative to the Judicial Courts during 2021, although the exact timing is uncertain. When this happens, we will be required to make a judicial deposit or provide a guarantee in respect of the disputed tax, interest and penalties. The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.\n\nThe contingent liabilities reported for indirect taxes relating to disputes with the Brazilian authorities are separate from the provisions listed in note 19. Unilever does not have provision and contingent liabilities for the same matters.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nIn 2019, a tax assessment was issued in connection with a UK tax audit that commenced in 2015. The total amount of the tax assessment in respect of this matter was \u20ac141 million and was included in other contingent liabilities at 31 December 2019. The UK tax authorities were reviewing the allocation of taxable income related to intangible assets and centralised group services as between Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC and whether Unilever N.V. had a permanent establishment in the UK. During 2020 the UK tax audit was concluded, and we have included the outcome of the tax assessment in this year's profit and loss account, hence there is no contingent liability as at 31 December 2020. As noted last year, we will be pursuing a Mutual Agreement Procedure with the Dutch and UK tax authorities to ensure we are not subject to double taxation.",

Acquisitions and disposals\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.\n\nGoodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount (which is generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary) in accordance with our accounting policies. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. Detailed information relating to goodwill is provided in note 9 on pages 134 to 136.\n\nTransaction costs are expensed as incurred, within non-underlying items.\n\nChanges in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill. The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Group completed the business acquisitions and disposals as listed below. In each case, 100% of the businesses were acquired unless stated otherwise. Total consideration for 2020 acquisitions is \u20ac6,337 million (2019: \u20ac1,167 million for acquisitions completed during that year). More information related to the 2020 acquisitions is provided on page 163 to 164.\n\n| Deal completion date   | Acquired/disposed business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 April 2020           | Acquired the health food drinks business of GlaxoSmithKline plc in India and 20 other  predominantly Asian markets ('the Main Horlicks Acquisition').

Unilever Overseas Holding B.V. purchased 82% of GSK Bangladesh Limited and Unilever PLC purchased the HFD IP in Bangladesh. The following disclosures relate only to the Main Horlicks Acquisition.\n\n## Main Horlicks Acquisition\n\nThe purpose of the acquisition was to add the Horlicks and Boost brands in certain geographical markets to Unilever's portfolio to increase presence in healthy nutrition and in high-growth emerging markets.\n\nThe total consideration paid was \u20ac5,294 million comprised of \u20ac449 million in cash and \u20ac4,845 million in shares of Hindustan Unilever Limited valued based on the share price of HUL on the completion date and the exchange rate on the same date (83.05 INR/\u20ac).\n\nThe provisional fair value of net assets for the acquisition that is recognised on the balance sheet is \u20ac3,204 million. Balances are provisional as we are finalising our review of the asset valuations. The main assets acquired were brands which were valued using an income approach model by estimating future cashflows generated by the brand and discounting them to present value using rates in line with a market participant expectation. The key assumptions in the brand valuations are revenue growth and discount rates. More information related to each major class of assets and liabilities acquired is provided on page 164.\n\nAt the date of acquisition we expected around \u20ac1.3 billion of the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. While we believe there is legal basis to claim the Horlicks goodwill as tax deductible, we note that the Indian Budget on 1 February 2021 includes a proposal to exclude goodwill from the definition of tax depreciable assets effective 1 April 2020. If enacted this would have no material impact on the income statement. Since the acquisition date, foreign exchange has decreased this goodwill in euros by \u20ac159 million.\n\nThe gross contractual value of trade and other receivables as at the dates of acquisition amounted to \u20ac77 million which is expected to be fully recoverable.\n\nWithin the acquired net assets, contingent liabilities amounting to \u20ac123 million in respect of ongoing litigation against GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited have been recognised based on management's estimate of the values of exposures and their assessment of the probability of the related claims being settled by the Group. The contingent liabilities mainly relate to direct and indirect tax disputes with the Indian tax authorities. There are several matters being disputed and in each case we believe that the likelihood that the Indian tax authorities will ultimately prevail is no higher than moderate, however we expect that most of these disputes will not be resolved for several years. Contingent assets of \u20ac73 million are also recognised, measured on the same basis, for the Group's right to future indemnification by GlaxoSmithKline Pte Limited and Horlicks Limited in relation to certain claims.",

Acquisitions and disposals continued\n\n## Impact of dilution of Group interest in Hindustan Unilever Limited\n\nThe acquisition of GSKCH by HUL was settled through the issue of (184.6 million) new shares of Hindustan Unilever Limited and so resulted in dilution of Unilever's interest in Hindustan Unilever Limited from 67.2% to 61.9%. The table below shows the impact of the decrease in shareholding on the equity attributable to shareholders of the Group.\n\n|                                                                          | \u20ac million 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| 67.2% share of HUL's net assets acquired before acquisition of GSKCH     | 718              |\n| 61.9% share of HUL's net assets acquired after acquisition of GSKCH      | 661              |\n| Loss recognised in equity due to dilution                                | (57)             |\n| Gain arising from proportionate share of GSKCH's net assets acquired     | 3,001            |\n| Net gain arising from the Main Horlicks Acquisition recognised in equity | 2,944            |\n\nAcquisition-related costs related to Horlicks of \u20ac42 million have been recorded within non-underlying items in the consolidated income statement for 2020 (2019: \u20ac12 million). Total costs relating to the issuance of shares amounting to \u20ac5 million have been recognised against equity by Hindustan Unilever Limited.\n\nThe Main Horlicks Acquisition contributed \u20ac415 million to Group turnover and \u20ac119 million to Group operating profit since the acquisition date. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, Group turnover would have been \u20ac50,867 million and Group operating profit would have been \u20ac8,342 million.\n\n## Effect on consolidated income statement\n\nThe overall impact of the Main Horlicks Acquisition and the other acquisitions on the consolidated income statement is as follows: The acquisition deals completed in 2020 have contributed \u20ac476 million to Group revenue and \u20ac124 million to Group operating profit since the relevant acquisition dates. If the acquisition deals completed in 2020 had all taken place at the beginning of the year, Group turnover would have been \u20ac51,116 million and Group operating profit would have been \u20ac8,371 million.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019 the Group completed the following business acquisitions and disposals as listed below.

Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal groups are classified as 'held for sale' when all of the following criteria are met: a decision has been made to sell; the assets are available for sale immediately; the assets are being actively marketed; and a sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nImmediately prior to classification as held for sale, the assets or groups of assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Subsequently, assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal costs. Assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\n|                                                 | \u20ac million 2020  Total   | \u20ac million 2019 Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Disposal groups held for sale (a)               |                         |                        |\n| Goodwill and intangibles                        | 1                       | 3                      |\n| Property, plant and equipment                   | 4                       | 13                     |\n| Inventories                                     | 6                       | 9                      |\n| Trade and other receivables                     | -                       | 1                      |\n| Other                                           | -                       | 3                      |\n|                                                 | 11                      | 29                     |\n| Property, plant and equipment held for sale (b) | 17                      | 53                     |\n| Assets held for sale                            | 28                      | 82                     |\n| Liabilities held for sale                       | 1                       | 1                      |\n\n(a)  In 2020, disposal groups held for sale consists of assets mainly relating to manufacturing assets.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Company Accounts Unilever PLC\n\n## Accounting information and policies\n\n## Cross-border merger between Unilever PLC and Unilever N.V. (Unification)\n\nOn 29 November 2020 (the 'effective date') a cross-border merger between Unilever PLC (PLC or the Company) and Unilever N.V. (NV) was implemented under UK Cross-Border Merger Regulations and Title 7, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. This is referred to as 'Unification' in the PLC financial statements. As a result (i) PLC acquired all of the assets, liabilities and legal relationships of NV by universal succession of title; (ii) NV was dissolved; and (iii) PLC issued and allotted shares in its capital to former NV Shareholders, except for a very small minority of NV Shareholders that chose to receive cash instead of PLC shares. The shareholders of NV received one new PLC share in exchange for each NV share held, consistent with the 1 to 1 equalisation ratio as set out in the Equalisation Agreement.\n\nAs a result of the cross-border merger, PLC mainly acquired investments in subsidiaries. These investments have been recognised in accordance with the Company's accounting policy for investments in subsidiaries which is cost (less any amounts written off to reflect any impairment). Refer to critical accounting estimates and judgements and note 5 for further explanation on the determination of the cost.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Title 7 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the transactions of NV are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from 1 January 2020, and the company accounts of NV from 1 January 2020 to the effective date are set out in note 17 of PLC's company accounts on page 176 to 183.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe company accounts of PLC are prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, international financial reporting standards (IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as 'fair value through other comprehensive income' or 'fair value through profit or loss', as well as derivative financial instruments, which are reported in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.\n\nUnilever PLC is included within the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\n## First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nIn 2019 PLC prepared its Company Accounts in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (FRS 101) and the UK Companies Act 2006. In 2020 PLC has prepared its company accounts in accordance with IFRS and the UK Companies Act 2006. The transition date to IFRS is 1 January 2019.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 1, PLC has applied IFRS retrospectively. The recognition and measurement principles of FRS 101 are to a large extent the same as IFRS. Management have reviewed these principles and concluded that there is no impact. As a result, the conversion from UK Financial Reporting Standard 101 (FRS 101) to IFRS does not change the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of PLC. Accordingly, we have not presented a reconciliation at the transition date, at 31 December 2019 and for the year 2019 from FRS 101 to IFRS. Since IFRS-EU does not contain the same disclosure exemptions as FRS 101, the disclosures are more extensive.\n\nThe implications of the transition from FRS 101 to IFRS are also applicable for NV. Refer to note 17 for the NV company accounts.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies of PLC and NV company accounts are the same as the Unilever Group, refer to pages 116 to 118, except for the accounting policies included below.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is pound sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company's functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of NV is the euro.\n\n## Turnover\n\nTurnover excludes value added tax and includes royalties and service fees received from group companies. Royalty income from brand and technology licence arrangements is recognised at the time sales are made by group companies. Revenue from services is recognised over time based on the usage of these services by group companies.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nThe operating profit is stated after deducting the costs that are mainly related to the royalties and delivered services. Expenses are allocated to the period in which they relate.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nShares in group companies are stated at cost less any amounts written off to reflect an impairment.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nNV was the sponsoring employer to several pension schemes. There were formal agreements in place for how the contributions due to the schemes are split between participating companies. Accordingly, NV recognised the assets and liabilities of the schemes for which it was a sponsoring employer in full on its company balance sheet. The recovery of contributions from other employing entities was in line with these existing agreements. NV accounted for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits'. The operating and financing costs of defined benefit plans were recognised separately in the income statement; service costs were systematically spread over the service lives of employees; and financing costs were recognised in the periods in which they arose. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, were recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The costs of individual events such as past benefits, enhancements, settlements and curtailments were recognised immediately in the income statement. The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of defined benefit plans were recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The charges to the income statement for defined contribution plans were NV contributions payable and the assets of such plans were not included in NV's balance sheet. On 26 November 2020 NV demerged these pension commitments to Unilever PL Netherlands B.V.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nWhere PLC and NV enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, they consider these to be insurance arrangements and account for them as such. In this respect, PLC and NV treat the guarantee contracts as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that they will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.\n\n## Capital Redemption Reserve\n\nThe nominal value of shares cancelled is transferred from share capital to the capital redemption reserve.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Company Accounts Unilever PLC continued\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.\n\nThe following judgements are what management believe have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the PLC and NV company accounts as indicated below:\n\n- \u25a0 Value of assets acquired as a result of Unification (PLC) - PLC has recognised the net assets acquired in the cross-border merger, primarily investments in subsidiaries, at cost in accordance with IAS 27 'Separate financial statements'. The consideration paid by PLC to acquire these net assets is the ordinary shares that were issued to NV shareholders. The consideration has been measured at fair value based on the number of shares issued and the share price at the effective date of the cross-border merger. We have valued the assets by reference to the shares that have been issued instead of calculating the fair value based on a discounted cash flow model since the cross-border merger is a transaction with market participants for which the consideration is based on a quoted share price in accordance with IFRS 13 ' Fair value measurement'.\n\nThe total value of the assets acquired has been allocated to each asset based on the relative proportion of their individual fair values.\n\nThe fair value has been allocated to each investment acquired based on the relative proportion of their individual fair values.\n\n- \u25a0 Transfer of IP economic substance (PLC) - On 1 December 2020 PLC contributed its intellectual property for the divisions Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care as a contribution in kind to Unilever Global IP Limited, a direct subsidiary of PLC. Management assessed if the transaction should be recognised at fair value or book value based on the economic substance of the transaction. Since no consideration was payable, management judged the transaction had no economic substance for reporting purposes and concluded the transaction should be recognised at book value. PLC recognises investments in subsidiaries at cost and reflected the transaction by an increase in its investment in Unilever Global IP Limited. Therefore, PLC recognised an increase in the cost of Unilever Global IP Limited and the derecognition of the cost of the intellectual property, both at book value.\n- \u25a0 Legal demerger economic substance (NV) - On 26 November 2020 a legal demerger occurred where NV incorporated Unilever Finance Netherlands B.V. (Unilever Finance), Unilever IP Holdings B.V. (Unilever IP) and Unilever PL Netherlands B.V. (Unilever PL) as its direct subsidiaries. Under the demerger these three entities received the following assets and liabilities of NV under universal succession of title:\n- \u25a0 Unilever Finance received the euro bonds including the rights, obligations and liabilities in respect of the bonds and all intra-group receivables which resulted from the on-lending of the funds received on the bonds.\n- \u25a0 Unilever IP received the IP rights for the Foods & Refreshments, Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care divisions and the beneficial ownership of the Unilever logo, including all intragroup or third party licenses, other agreements, goodwill, tax related receivables and payables (including deferred tax liabilities), intercompany receivables and payables, other existing claims obligations and registration rights related to the IP rights.\n- \u25a0 Unilever PL received the pension commitments including the related\n- rights, obligations and liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. Management used judgement to assess if the legal demerger had economic substance for reporting purposes. The three entities issued one share each to NV with a nominal value of \u20ac1 in exchange for the assets and liabilities received so management judged the transaction as a reorganisation without economic substance which should be recognised at book value. NV recognised an investment value in Unilever Finance and Unilever IP for the same amount as the book value of the net assets acquired by those entities of respectively \u20ac2 million and \u20ac690 million.\n- \u25a0 Contribution of investments in subsidiaries and related receivables and payables economic substance (NV) - On 25 November 2020 and 27 November 2020 NV contributed investments in several subsidiaries and related receivables and payables into its subsidiary Unilever International Holdings B.V. (UIH) for no consideration. Management used judgement to assess if the contribution in kind from NV to\n\nUIH had economic substance for reporting purposes. Since no consideration was paid by UIH, management considered the transaction a reorganisation without economic substance which should be recognised at book value. NV recognises investments in subsidiaries at cost and chose to reflect the transaction in the investment value of UIH on the balance sheet. Therefore, NV recognised an increase in the cost of UIH and the derecognition of the cost of investments in other subsidiaries and the related receivables and payables at book value.\n\n- \u25a0 Recognition of shares transferred to an employee share ownership trust (PLC and NV) - On 17 November 2020 NV and PLC established an employee share ownership trust and on 20 November 2020 NV transferred 4,523,367 (PLC and NV) ordinary shares, 892,155 NV NYRSs and 468,989 PLC ADSs that it held to the trust. Management assessed if the shares should be derecognised from NV's balance sheet. Although the shares were transferred to the trust, NV retained the majority of the risks and rewards of the funding arrangement because the trust was acting with regard to the recommendations of NV in respect of the delivery of such shares to satisfy share award obligations. Management concluded that the trust was acting on behalf of NV and PLC and was acting as an agent instead of a principal. Therefore management considered it appropriate that there was no change in the recognition of the NV shares as treasury shares and PLC shares as an investment on NV's balance sheet.\n\nAs a result of the cross-border merger, the NV shares were cancelled and new PLC shares were issued to the trust in respect of these shares. Management assessed if the shares should be recorded at fair value or book value. Since the acquisition of the investments in the cross-border merger was recorded at cost, being the fair value of the shares issued by PLC, management considered it to be consistent to recognise the shares at fair value in the other reserves.\n\n## 1.

The PLC ordinary shares that were issued to NV shareholders represent the consideration paid to acquire the investments in subsidiaries and should be measured at fair value. In total PLC issued 1,460,713,122 ordinary shares at the effective date for total consideration of \u00a365,288 million. This value has been allocated to the investments in subsidiaries that PLC acquired based on the relative proportion of their individual fair values to the total value of net assets acquired by means of Unification.\n- \u25a0 On 1 December 2020 PLC contributed its intellectual property and other assets directly related to the divisions Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care as a contribution in kind to Unilever Global IP Limited, a direct subsidiary of PLC. With the contribution PLC recognised a disposal of the intellectual property of \u00a356 million, disposal of \u00a36 million other assets, recognised an intragroup liability of \u00a381 million and a corresponding \u00a3143 million increase in the investment in Unilever Global IP Limited.\n\nInvestments include the subsidiary company Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), with a cost of \u00a32,197 million (2019: \u00a32,197 million). The shares of HUL are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and have a market value of \u00a326,789 million (2019: \u00a322,900 million) as at 31 December 2020. Information on the non-controlling interest in HUL is given in note 15B of the consolidated financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries comprise equity shares of group companies. These investments only generate cash inflows in combination with other assets within the group. Accordingly cash inflows are not independent at any level below the cash generating units (CGUs) used for group impairment testing purposes.  There have been no impairments recorded against the group CGUs at the end of the reporting periods and therefore there is no indication that any of the investments in subsidiaries would be subject to impairment.\n\n## 6.

As these are amounts due from other entities within the Group, PLC has estimated the expected credit losses to be immaterial. Our historical experience of collecting these balances supported by the level of default confirms that the credit risk is low.",

Capital and funding\n\nThe Company's capital and funding strategy is described in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 10A. Called up share capital\n\nThe called up share capital amounting to \u00a382 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: \u00a336 million) consists of 2,629,243,772 (2019: 1,168,530,650) ordinary shares and nil (2019: 100,000) deferred shares. 50% of the deferred stock was held by N.V. Elma - a subsidiary of NV and 50% of the deferred stock was held by United Holdings Limited a subsidiary of PLC. Shortly before Unification, PLC bought back the deferred shares for \u00a3100,000 and subsequently these shares were cancelled immediately prior to the implementation of Unification.\n\nAs a result of the cross-border merger with NV, PLC issued 1,460,713,122 new ordinary shares to NV shareholders. A statutory withdrawal mechanism was provided for NV shareholders who voted against Unification and who did not wish to hold PLC shares. These shareholders have received a cash compensation instead which has been settled by PLC.\n\nInformation on the called up and paid up capital is given in note 15A of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 10B.

On 29 November 2020 PLC issued 1,460,713,122 PLC ordinary shares to former NV shareholders in return for the assets and liabilities of NV. The fair value of the consideration received has been determined as the sterling equivalent of the NV market capitalisation at Unification and the excess over the nominal value of the shares that were issued is recognised as share premium.\n\n## 10C.

The amount paid to repurchase these shares was initially recognised in other reserves and was transferred to retained profit on cancellation.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 PLC held interests in 50,000 (2019: nil) of its own ordinary shares.

Treasury and risk management\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in the Company's balance sheet comprise amounts due from and due to group companies, loans due from and due to group companies and bonds. The Company does not consider the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2020 to be significantly different to their carrying value.\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in note 16B on pages 151 to 153 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Market risks\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is pound sterling, however the Company is exposed to intercompany loans receivable, intercompany loans payable and bonds that are denominated in other currencies. The Company's exposure for holding financial assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency is \u00a3180 million (2019: \u00a3211 million). The Company entered into derivatives to mitigate the foreign currency risk but does not apply hedge accounting.\n\n## Currency sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below details the company's sensitivity to a 10% increase (2019: 10% increase) in the pound sterling against the foreign currencies. These percentages represent management's assessment of the possible changes in the foreign exchange rates at the respective yearends. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the periodend for the above percentage change in foreign currency rates.\n\nA 10% strengthening of the foreign currencies against the pound sterling would have led to approximately an additional \u00a318 million gain in the income statement (2019: \u00a321 million gain).\n\nA 10% weakening of the foreign currencies against the pound sterling would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks on its intercompany loans receivable and intercompany loans payables as these are floating. Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest income and interest cost. The intercompany loans receivables and loans payables were initially recognised at their fair value. The fair value of these assets is the same as their carrying amount at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the statement of financial position date. The following changes in the interest rates represent management's assessment of the possible change in interest rates at the respective year-ends:\n\nAssuming that all variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2020 would have led to an additional \u00a330 million of finance cost (2019: \u00a330 million additional finance cost).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest on a full-year basis would have an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## 12. Transactions with related parties\n\nA related party is a person or entity that is related to PLC. These include both people and entities that have, or are subject to, the influence or control of PLC. Information on key management personnel has been given in note 4A of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInformation on the cross-border merger between PLC and NV is given in notes 1, 5 and 10.\n\nThe following related party balances existed with group companies at 31 December.\n\n|                                                        | \u00a3 million 31 Dec 2020   | \u00a3 million 31 Dec 2019   | \u00a3 million 1 Jan 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Trading and other balances due  from/(to) subsidiaries | 681                     | 2,029                   | (4,239)                |\n| Loans due from/(to) subsidiaries                       | (1,423)                 | (1,456)                 | -                      |\n\nRefer to notes 6, 7, 8 and 9 for an explanation of these balances.\n\nThe following related party transactions took place during the year with subsidiaries:\n\n|                                    | \u00a3 million  2020   | \u00a3 million 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Turnover                           |                   |                  |\n| Royalties                          | 562               | 571              |\n| Services                           | 1,719             | 1,622            |\n| Others                             |                   |                  |\n| Dividends received                 | 456               | 5,223            |\n| Loans and related  interest        | 49                | 1,150            |\n| Incurred costs and  royalties paid | (2,024)           | (1,909)          |\n\nInformation on guarantees given by PLC to group companies is given in note 13 below.\n\n## 13. Contingent liabilities and financial commitments\n\nThe total amount of guarantees is \u00a330,734 million (2019: \u00a322,688 million). This consists of guarantees relating to:\n\n- \u25a0 The long-term debt and commercial paper issued by group companies such as Unilever Finance Netherlands BV and Unilever Capital Corporation, which are joint guarantees with Unilever United States, Inc.;\n- \u25a0 Group companies' obligations to the UK and Netherlands pension funds and of the Group's captive insurance company; and\n- \u25a0 Certain borrowings and derivatives of other group companies.\n\nThere are also certain financial commitments which are not included in the total amount of guarantees because they do not currently relate to existing liabilities or cannot be quantified:\n\n- \u25a0 PLC and Unilever United States, Inc. have guaranteed the standby facilities of $7,965 million (2019: $7,865 million) which were undrawn as at 31 December 2020 and 2019;\n- \u25a0 The joint and several liability undertakings issued by NV in accordance with Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code for almost all of its Dutch group companies were withdrawn by means of filings with the Dutch Trade Register on 27 November 2020, being the last practicable date prior to the effective date of the cross-border merger between NV and PLC. With effect from the date of the cross-border merger, PLC issued a guarantee confirming PLC's liability for any residual liability referred to in Article 2:404 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code of NV remaining after the withdrawal of such undertakings, to the extent that such liability did not transfer in the cross-border merger; and\n- \u25a0 PLC has guaranteed some contingent consideration of Group companies relating to past business acquisitions and financial commitments including indemnities arising from past business disposals; and certain global and regional contracts.\n\nThe likelihood of all of these guarantees and financial commitments being called upon is considered to be remote and so the fair value is deemed to be immaterial.",

For this transfer PLC will derecognise the intangible assets of \u00a32,954 million and increase the investment in Unilever Global IP Limited by the same amount.\n\nIn addition, on 1 January 2021, PLC entered into new agreements to facilitate cross-licenses between PLC, Unilever Global IP Limited and Unilever IP Holdings B.V.\n\nOn 4 February 2021 the Directors announced a dividend of \u00a30.3760 per PLC ordinary share.

Value in use of these assets is calculated as the present value of future cash flows and is based on the expected royalty income taken from our annual forecast and strategic plans over the next five years. We consider each acquisition separately to determine the most appropriate timescale before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year net cash flows.\n\nFor details of the indefinite useful life assessment, reference is made to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements on page 134.",

Company Accounts continued\n\nAs part of the legal demerger effectuated and transfer of investments and subsidiaries and related receivables and payables (refer to critical accounting estimates and judgements on page 172) NV transferred the majority of its financial assets and liabilities to its direct subsidiaries.\n\n## h. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThere was no cash at bank and in hand for which payment notice was required at either 29 November 2020, 31 December 2019 or 1 January 2019.\n\n## i. Deferred tax liabilities\n\n|                                     | \u20ac million   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January 2020                   | 339         |\n| Income statement:                   |             |\n| Charges                             | 15          |\n| Transferred as a result of demerger | (354)       |\n| At 29 November 2020                 | -           |\n| Due within one year                 | -           |\n| Due after one year                  | -           |\n\nAt the balance sheet date NV has no unused tax credits (2019: \u20ac250 million) available for offset against future tax profits as the deferred tax liabilities have been transferred with the legal demerger. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits against which the credits will be utilised.\n\n## j. Capital and funding\n\n## Called up share capital\n\nThe called up share capital amounted to \u20ac234 million at 29 November 2020 (31 December 2019: \u20ac235 million), consisted of 1,460,714,804 (2019: 1,460,714,804) NV ordinary shares and nil (2019: 2,400) special ordinary shares. These special ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2,400 were held 50% by N.V. Elma - a subsidiary of NV and 50% by United Holdings Limited - a subsidiary of PLC. Shortly before Unification, NV bought back the special ordinary shares for \u20ac321 million and subsequently these shares were cancelled upon implementation of Unification.\n\nInformation on the called up and paid up capital is given in note 15A of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Share premium\n\nShare premium is the excess of the consideration received over the nominal value of shares issued. The share premium shown in the balance sheet was not available during the year for the issue of bonus shares or for repayment without incurring withholding tax payable by NV.\n\n## Legal reserves\n\nIn 2006 the NV ordinary shares were split in the ratio 3 to 1 and at the same time the share capital, previously denominated in Dutch guilders, was converted into euros. Due to rounding the then nominal value per share differed from the value expressed in Dutch guilders. As a result, the reported share capital issued at 31 December 2006 was \u20ac16 million lower than in 2005.\n\n## Other reserves\n\n| Treasury shares                               | \u20ac million For the period  ended   29 Nov 2020   | \u20ac million For the year  ended   31 Dec 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Beginning of the year                         | (354)                                           | (8,896)                                       |\n| Change during the year:                       |                                                 |                                               |\n| Buy back of shares                            | -                                               | -                                             |\n| Cancellation of shares                        | 321                                             | 8,516                                         |\n| Movement in treasury shares                   | (121)                                           | 26                                            |\n| Transferred to employee share ownership trust | 154                                             | -                                             |\n| Year-end                                      | -                                               | (354)                                         |\n\nDuring 2020, 2,400 special shares were repurchased and cancelled (2019: 254,012,896 ordinary shares were cancelled). The amount paid to repurchase these shares was initially recognised in other reserves and was transferred to retained profit on cancellation.\n\nAt 31 December 2019 NV held 8,018,615 of its own shares as treasury shares in within other reserves. Shortly before Unification (see note 1 for more information on Unification) 2,556,151 NV ordinary shares and 892,155 NV NYRSs held by NV in connection with share-based compensation plans were transferred to an employee share ownership trust. At 29 November 2020 NV held 3,448,306 of its own ordinary shares via the employee share ownership trust, which are held as treasury shares within other reserves.

The average number of employees during 2020 included 8,704 seasonal workers. We believe our relationship with our employees and any labour unions of which they may be part is satisfactory in all material respects.\n\n## Global employee share plans (shares)\n\nIn November 2014, Unilever's global employee plan 'SHARES' was launched in 17 countries. SHARES gives eligible Unilever employees below management level the opportunity to invest between \u20ac10 and \u20ac200 per month from their net salary in Unilever shares. For every three shares our employees buy (Investment Shares), Unilever will give them one free Matching Share, which will vest if employees hold their Investment Shares for at least three years. The Matching Shares are not subject to any performance conditions. In 2015, SHARES was rolled out globally and is now offered in more than 100 countries. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in SHARES. As of 23 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), awards for 427,810 PLC shares were outstanding under SHARES.\n\n## North American share plans\n\nUnilever also maintains share plans for its North American employees that are governed by an umbrella plan referred to as the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. These plans are the North American equivalents of the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and SHARES plans, as amended from time to time. The rules governing these share plans are materially the same as the rules governing the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and SHARES plans, respectively. However, the plans contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and they are subject to US and Canadian employment and tax laws. The plans are administered by the North America Compensation Committee of Unilever United States, Inc. and they are governed by New York law.\n\nThe foregoing description of the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, including all amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form S-8 (File No. 333-185299) filed with the SEC on 6 December 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Compensation committee\n\nThe Committee is concerned with the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the tier of management directly below the Boards. The Committee also has responsibility for the cash and executive and all-employee share-based incentive plans, the Remuneration Policy and performance evaluation of the Unilever Leadership Executive and the periodic review of the remuneration and related policies of the wider workforce to assess alignment to PLC's purpose, value and strategy.\n\n## Directors and senior management\n\n## Family relationship\n\nThere are no family relationships between any of our Executive Directors, members of the ULE or Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Other arrangements\n\nNone of our Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors or other key management personnel are elected or appointed under any arrangement or understanding with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or others.",

PLC ordinary shares are also listed and traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nIn the United States, PLC American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) acts for PLC as depositary.\n\nAt 23 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), there were 2,153 registered holders of PLC American Depositary Receipts in the United States. We estimate that approximately 11% of PLC's ordinary shares (including shares underlying PLC American Depositary Receipts) were held in the United States (approximately 11% in 2019).\n\nIf you are a shareholder of PLC, your interest is in a UK legal entity, your dividends will be paid in pound sterling (converted into US dollars if you have American Depositary Receipts) and you may be subject to UK tax.\n\nTo Unilever's knowledge, PLC is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation, any foreign government or by any other legal or natural person, severally or jointly. PLC is not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at any subsequent date result in a change of control of PLC.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint ventures and associates. Other than those disclosed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements (and incorporated herein as above), there were no related party transactions that were material to the Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be reported in 2020 up to 23 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).\n\n## Dividend record\n\nThe following tables show the dividends declared and dividends paid by PLC for the last five years, expressed in terms of the revised share denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006.\n\n2020\n\n|                                  |       | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|----------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Dividends declared for the year  |       |        |        |        |        |\n| PLC dividends                    |       |        |        |        |        |\n| Dividend per 31/9p               | \u00a31.48 | \u00a31.43  | \u00a31.35  | \u00a31.26  | \u00a31.09  |\n| Dividend per 31/9p (US Registry) | $1.91 | $1.83  | $1.82  | $1.66  | $1.42  |\n| Dividends paid during the year   |       |        |        |        |        |\n| PLC dividends                    |       |        |        |        |        |\n| Dividend per 31/9p               | \u00a31.45 | \u00a31.42  | \u00a31.33  | \u00a31.22  | \u00a31.04  |\n| Dividend per 31/9p (US Registry) | $1.85 | $1.82  | $1.83  | $1.56  | $1.40  |",

Similarly, other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to time, there are no limitations relating only to non-residents of the UK under English law or the PLC's Articles of Association on the right to be a holder of, and to vote in respect of, the company's shares.\n\n## Unilever Annual Report on Form 20-F 2020\n\nFiled with the SEC on the SEC's website. Printed copies are available, free of charge, upon request to Unilever PLC, Investor Relations department, 100 Victoria Embankment, London, EC4Y 0DY United Kingdom.\n\n## Documents on display in the United States\n\nUnilever files and furnishes reports and information with the United States SEC. Certain of our reports and other information that we file or furnish to the SEC are also available to the public over the internet on the SEC's website.\n\n## Other information on the Company\n\n## Innovation, Research and Development\n\nInnovation is at the heart of Unilever's ambition to grow sustainably. Science, technology and product development are central to our plans to keep providing consumers with great brands that improve their lives while having a positive impact on the environment and society.\n\nAll our innovations are based on key insights into what consumers want and need. We aim to develop products that have purpose, so that consumers choose them again and again. We work on a wide portfolio of projects, combining the search for breakthrough technologies with the constant drive to respond to competitors, move into new markets, and make our products more sustainable. The products we develop through innovation, whether by ourselves or through our extensive partnerships with leading scientists, academic institutions, suppliers and specialist businesses, play an essential role in our ambition to make a positive impact on the world around us. Science and Technology will be key in improving health, wellbeing, nutrition and reducing environmental impact, and we want to be at the forefront of this work.\n\nOur six main R&D centres are in the US, UK, the Netherlands, India and China. Our research aims to bring together the best thinking and ideas from wherever they exist - not only do we pull together the best scientific expertise from within Unilever, but we also work closely with universities and specialist companies.\n\nGlobal Design teams take our breakthroughs in Science and Technology one step further, turning unique insights into the products that consumers want and need. Development and testing of new technology takes place until it fits the product description.\n\nOur Cluster and Category Design teams draw on local knowledge - such as consumer preference, the regulatory framework, legal considerations and competitor products - as they ready a product for launch into a new market. They work closely with colleagues in marketing and supply chain to make sure the new product can be manufactured efficiently.\n\nMore than 5,000 Unilever R&D professionals are building our brands through innovation. We invest around \u20ac1 billion in R&D each year, and we hold a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and patent applications.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nOur products use a wide variety of raw and packaging materials which we source internationally and which may be subject to price volatility either directly or as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2020, we witnessed significant Covid-19 induced volatility both in the commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. A sharp fall in demand during the early days of the pandemic saw many commodities hit their historic lows. However, pick-up in economic activity and production shortfalls in certain agricultural commodities fuelled significant inflation in few materials towards the end of the year. Palm oil, vegetable oils and Indian origin tea was most impacted. Crude linked raw and packing materials remained subdued. Prices were also negatively impacted following foreign exchange rates deterioration across many emerging markets, with significant impact from Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, India, South Africa, and Turkey.\n\nLooking ahead to 2021, we expect continued volatility in commodity and foreign exchange markets. We remain watchful of any further spread of the virus and the success of vaccination programmes across the world.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nCertain of our businesses, such as ice cream, are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in sales. However, Unilever operates globally in many different markets and product categories, and no individual element of seasonality is likely to be material to the results of the Group as a whole.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe have a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, and we conduct some of our operations under licences that are based on patents or trademarks owned or controlled by others. We are not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We use all appropriate efforts to protect our brands and technology.\n\n## Competition\n\nAs a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, we are competing with a diverse set of competitors. Some of these operate on an international scale like ourselves, while others have a more regional or local focus. Our business model centres on building brands which consumers know, trust, like and buy in conscious preference to those of our competitors. Our brands command loyalty and affinity and deliver superior performance.\n\n## Information on market share\n\nUnless otherwise stated, market share refers to value share as opposed to volume share. The market data and competitive position classifications are taken from independent industry sources in the markets in which Unilever operates.\n\n## Iran-related required disclosure\n\nUnilever operates in Iran through a non-US subsidiary. In 2020, sales in Iran were significantly less than one per cent of Unilever's worldwide turnover. During the year, this non-US subsidiary had approximately \u20ac10,735,176 in gross revenues and less than \u20ac5,131,414 in net profits attributable to the sale of food, personal care and home care products to entities affiliated with the Government of Iran. These entities were the Hotel Homa Group, which is owned by the Social Security Organisation of Iran; Kowsar, which is affiliated with the Bank of Industry and Mine of Iran; Refah, which is a chain of 200 state-owned department stores, and ETKA, which is a trading organisation with over 400 chain stores affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Defence for Armed Forces Logistics. Our non-US subsidiary has chosen to discontinue selling consumer products to Kowsar, Refah and ETKA. Income, payroll and other taxes, duties and fees (including for utilities) were payable to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities in connection with our operations. Our non-US subsidiary maintains bank accounts in Iran with various banks to facilitate our business in the country and make any required payments to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities. While we currently continue our activities in Iran, we are continuously evaluating such activities in light of the evolving regulatory environment.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information for US listing purposes continued\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group has interests in properties in most of the countries where there are Unilever operations. None of these interests are individually material in the context of the Group as a whole. The properties are used predominantly to house production and distribution activities and as offices. There is a mixture of leased and owned property throughout the Group. We are not aware of any environmental issues affecting the properties which would have a material impact upon the Group, and there are no material encumbrances on our properties. Any difference between the market value of properties held by the Group and the amount at which they are included in the balance sheet is not significant. We believe our existing facilities are satisfactory for our current business and we currently have no plans to construct new facilities or expand or improve our current facilities in a manner that is material to the Group.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe comments below in relation to United Kingdom and United States taxation are based on current United Kingdom and United States federal income tax law as applied in England and Wales and the United States respectively, and HM Revenue & Customs ('HMRC') and Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') practice (which may not be binding on HMRC or the IRS) respectively, in each case as at the latest practicable date before the date of this document.\n\n## Taxation for US persons holding shares or American Depositary Shares in PLC\n\nThe following notes are provided for guidance. US persons should consult their local tax advisers, particularly in connection with potential liability to pay US taxes on disposal, lifetime gift or bequest of their shares or American Depositary Shares ('ADS's). A US person is a US individual citizen or resident, a corporation organised under the laws of the United States, any state or the District of Columbia, or any other legal person subject to US Federal Income Tax on its worldwide income.\n\n## United Kingdom taxation on dividends\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, income tax is not withheld from dividends paid by most United Kingdom companies, including PLC. Shareholders of PLC, whether resident in the United Kingdom or not, receive the full amount of the dividend actually declared.\n\nA non-UK resident shareholder or ADS holder holding their shares or ADSs otherwise than in connection with any trade, profession or vocation carried on through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK will not generally be subject to UK tax in respect of dividends paid by PLC.\n\n## United States taxation on dividends\n\nIf you are a US person, the distribution up to the amount of PLC's earnings and profits for US Federal Income Tax purposes will be ordinary dividend income. In addition, an additional tax of 3.8% will apply to dividends and other investment income received by individuals with incomes exceeding certain thresholds.\n\nAny portion of the distribution that exceeds PLC's earnings and profits is subject to different rules. This portion is a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in PLC's shares or ADSs, and thereafter is treated as a gain on a disposition of the shares or ADSs. PLC does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US Federal Income Tax accounting principles. You should therefore assume that any distribution by PLC with respect to the shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. You should consult your own tax advisers with respect to the appropriate US Federal Income Tax treatment of any distribution received from us.\n\nDividends received by an individual will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided the individual has held the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date, that PLC is a qualified foreign corporation and certain other conditions are satisfied. PLC is a qualified foreign corporation for this purpose. The dividend is not eligible for the dividends received deduction allowable to corporations. The dividend is foreign source income for US foreign tax credit purposes.\n\nFor US Federal Income Tax purposes, the amount of any dividend paid in a non-US currency will be included in income in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividends are received by you or the depositary (in the case of ADSs), regardless of whether they are converted into US dollars at that time. If the non-US currency is converted into US dollars on the day they are received, you generally will not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect of this dividend income.\n\n## UK taxation on capital gains\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, when you dispose of shares or ADSs you may be liable to pay United Kingdom tax in respect of any gain accruing on the disposal.\n\nHowever, if you are either:\n\n- \u25a0 an individual who is not resident in the United Kingdom for the year in question; or\n- \u25a0 a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom when the gain accrues\n\nyou will generally not be liable to United Kingdom tax on any gains made on disposal of your shares or ADSs.\n\nThere are exceptions to this general rule, two of which are: if the shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade or business which is conducted in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment; or if the shares or ADSs are held by an individual who becomes resident in the UK having left the UK for a period of nonresidence of five years or less and who was resident for at least four of the seven tax years prior to leaving the UK. In such cases, you may be liable to United Kingdom tax in respect of the disposal of shares or ADSs.\n\n## United States taxation on capital gains\n\nA US person generally will recognise capital gain or loss for US Federal Income Tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realised on the sale and the US person's adjusted tax basis in the shares or ADSs, in each case as determined in US dollars. US persons should consult their own tax advisers about how to determine the US dollar value of any foreign currency received as proceeds on the sale of shares or ADSs and the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss upon conversion of the foreign currency into US dollars. The capital gain or loss recognised on the sale will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US person's holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Non-corporate US persons are subject to tax on long-term capital gain at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nUnder the current estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom, shares or ADSs (regardless of whether they are situated in the United Kingdom for inheritance tax purposes) held by an individual shareholder who is:\n\n- \u25a0 domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; and\n- \u25a0 not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United Kingdom\n\nwill generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax:\n\n- \u25a0 on the individual's death; or\n- \u25a0 on a gift of the shares during the individual's lifetime.\n\nWhere shares or ADSs are held on trust, they will generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax where the settlor at the time of the settlement:\n\n- \u25a0 was domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; and\n- \u25a0 was not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United Kingdom.\n\nAn exception is if the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the shareholder in the United Kingdom or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhere shares or ADSs are subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax and United States federal gift or federal estate tax, the amount of the tax paid in one jurisdiction can generally be credited against the tax due in the other jurisdiction.",

        "page_content": "Where a United Kingdom inheritance tax liability is prima facie not payable by virtue of the convention, that tax can become payable if any applicable federal gift or federal estate tax on the shares or ADSs in the United States is not paid.\n\nWhere shares are dealt with through a clearing system or in the form of ADSs, the situs of the shares may not be determinative of the situs of the interests held by holders through such system or of such ADSs for United Kingdom inheritance tax purposes. Where shares are dealt with through Euroclear Nederland there are arguments that the interests of participants in Euroclear Nederland will be situated outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom inheritance tax so long as Euroclear Nederland maintains the book-entry register of such participants' interests outside the United Kingdom, although HMRC may not accept this analysis. Similarly, there are arguments that ADSs registered on a register outside the United Kingdom will be situated outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom inheritance tax, although again HMRC may not accept this analysis. Shareholders to whom this may be relevant should consult an appropriate professional adviser.\n\nIf the ADSs or the shares dealt with through Euroclear Nederland or both are not situated in the United Kingdom, a gift of such ADSs or such shares by, or the death of, an individual holder of such assets who is neither domiciled nor deemed to be domiciled (under certain rules relating to long residence or previous domicile) in the United Kingdom will not generally give rise to a liability to United Kingdom inheritance tax regardless of whether the estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom applies. Special rules may also apply to such ADSs or such shares dealt with through Euroclear Nederland which are held on trust.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements in this section are intended as a general guide to the current United Kingdom stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax ('SDRT') position. Special rules apply to certain transactions such as transfers of the shares to a company connected with the transferor and those rules are not described below. Investors should also note that certain categories of person are not liable to stamp duty or SDRT and others may be liable at a higher rate or may, although not primarily liable for tax, be required to notify and account for SDRT under the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations 1986.\n\n## Issue of shares\n\nSubject to the points noted below in respect of shares issued to clearance services (such as Euroclear Nederland) or which are issued into a depositary receipt system where the shares are to be held in ADS form, no stamp duty or SDRT will arise on the issue of shares in registered form by PLC.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nExcept in relation to clearance services and depositary receipt systems (to which special rules outlined below apply) stamp duty at the rate of 0.5 per cent. (rounded up to the next multiple of \u00a35) of the amount or value of the consideration given will generally be payable on an instrument transferring PLC shares. A charge to SDRT will also generally arise on an unconditional agreement to transfer PLC shares (at the rate of 0.5 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration payable). However, if within six years of the date of the agreement becoming unconditional an instrument of transfer is executed pursuant to the agreement, and stamp duty is paid on that instrument, any SDRT already paid will be refunded (generally, but not necessarily, with interest) provided that a claim for repayment is made, and any outstanding liability to SDRT will be cancelled. The liability to pay stamp duty or SDRT is generally satisfied by the purchaser or transferee.\n\n## Shares held through clearance services including Euroclear Nederland\n\nSpecial rules apply where shares are issued or transferred to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person providing a clearance service. In such circumstances, SDRT or stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5 per cent., with subsequent transfers within the clearance service then being free from SDRT and stamp duty (except in relation to clearance service providers that have made an election under section 97A(1) of the Finance Act 1986 which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs, to which the special rules apply).\n\nIn light of EU case law, HMRC accepted that the 1.5 per cent. charge is in breach of EU law so far as it applies to issues of shares or to transfers of shares that are an integral part of a share issue. This EU case law will continue to be recognised and followed pursuant to the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the 'EUWA').\n\nHMRC's published view is that the 1.5 per cent. SDRT or stamp duty charge continues to apply to other transfers of shares into a clearance service, although this has been disputed. In view of the continuing uncertainty, specific professional advice should be sought before incurring a 1.5 per cent. stamp duty or SDRT charge in any circumstances. Any liability for stamp duty or SDRT in respect of a transfer of shares into a clearance service, or in respect of a transfer of shares within such a service, which does arise will strictly be accountable by the clearance service or its nominee but may, in practice, be payable by the relevant participant in the clearance service.\n\n## Shares held in ADS form\n\nOn the basis of EU case law referred to above and the EUWA, there should be no stamp duty or SDRT on an issuance of shares into a depositary receipt system where such transfer is an integral part of the raising of capital by the company concerned. A transfer of shares into a depositary receipt system may be subject to SDRT or stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5 per cent., with subsequent transfers of depositary receipts then being free from SDRT.\n\nAny liability for stamp duty or SDRT in respect of a transfer of shares into a depositary receipt system which does arise will strictly be accountable by the depositary receipt system operator or its nominee but may, in practice, be payable by the relevant holder of the depositary receipts.\n\nAn issue of ADSs by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as depositary in respect of the ADSs will not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT. An agreement for the transfer of ADSs will not be subject to SDRT but a charge to stamp duty will technically arise on the transfer of ADSs if it is executed in the UK or relates to any property situated, or to any matter or thing done or to be done, in the UK. However, the only sanction for failing to pay such stamp duty is that the instrument of transfer cannot be produced as evidence in a UK court. Therefore, no UK stamp duty should in practice be payable on the acquisition or transfer of existing ADSs or transfer of beneficial ownership of ADSs.\n\n## Backup withholding and information reporting\n\nPayments of dividends and other proceeds with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs by US persons will be reported to you and to the IRS as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fail to comply with applicable certification requirements. Some holders are not subject to backup withholding. You should consult your tax adviser as to your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.\n\n## Disclosure requirements for US individual holders\n\nUS individuals that hold certain specified non-US financial assets, including stock in a non-US corporation, with values in excess of certain thresholds are required to file Form 8938 with their US Federal Income Tax return. Such Form requires disclosure of information concerning such non-US assets, including the value of the assets. Failure to file the Form when required is subject to penalties. An exemption from reporting applies to non-US assets held through a US financial institution generally including a non-US branch or subsidiary of a US institution and a US branch of a non-US institution. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding the possible application of this disclosure requirement to their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Description of securities other than equity securities\n\nDeutsche Bank serves as the depositary (Depositary) for PLC's American Depositary Receipt Programme.",

The brokers in turn charge these transaction fees to their clients.\n\nNote that the fees and charges an investor may be required to pay may vary over time and may be changed by us and by the depositary bank. Notice of any changes will be given to investors.\n\n## Depositary payments - fiscal year 2020\n\nDeutsche Bank has been the depositary bank for its American Depositary Receipt Programme since 1 July 2014.

In relation to 2020, PLC did not receive payments from Deutsche Bank.\n\n## Defaults, dividend arrearages and delinquencies\n\n## Defaults Programme\n\nThere has been no material default in the payment of principal, interest, a sinking or purchase fund instalment or any other material default relating to indebtedness of the Group.\n\n## Dividend arrearages and delinquencies\n\nThere have been no arrears in payment of dividends on, and material delinquency with respect to, any class of preferred stock of any significant subsidiary of the Group.",

Management believes that the COSO framework (2013) is a suitable framework for its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting;\n- \u25a0 Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020, and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management's assessment and conclusion excludes the Main Horlicks Acquisition, Horlicks Bangladesh, Liquid IV and SmartyPants from this assessment, as they were acquired on 1 April 2020, 30 June 2020, 1 October 2020, and 23 December 2020 respectively. These entities are included in our 2020 consolidated financial statements, and together they constituted approximately 11% of our total assets as at 31 December 2020 (of which 10% represented goodwill and intangible assets acquired) and approximately 1% of total turnover for the year ended 31 December 2020; and\n- \u25a0 KPMG LLP, who have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020, have also audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2020 and have issued an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Principal accountant fees and services\n\n|                        | \u20ac million 2020   | \u20ac million 2019   | \u20ac million 2018   |\n|------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Audit fees (a)         | 19               | 17               | 16               |\n| Audit-related fees (b) | 7 (d)            | - (d)            | 5 (d)            |\n| Tax fees               | - (c)            | - (c)            | - (c)            |\n| All other fees         | - (c)            | - (c)            | - (c)            |\n\n- (c)   Amounts paid in relation to each type of service are individually less than \u20ac1 million.

(NV) and Unilever Capital Corporation (UCC) filed a US Shelf registration, which was unconditionally and fully guaranteed, jointly and severally, by NV, Unilever PLC (PLC) and Unilever United States, Inc. (UNUS) and that updated the NV and UCC US Shelf registration filed on 27 July 2017, which was unconditionally and fully guaranteed, jointly and severally, by NV, PLC and UNUS.\n\nAs a result of Unification, PLC assumed NV's liabilities in relation to debt issued under the US shelf registration programme. UCC and UNUS are each indirectly 100% owned by PLC and consolidated in the financial statements of the Unilever Group. In relation to the US Shelf registration, US$11.5 billion of Notes were outstanding at 31 December 2020 (2019: US$12.35 billion; 2018: US$12.5 billion) with coupons ranging from 0.375% to 5.900%. These Notes are repayable between 10 February 2021 and 15 November 2032.\n\nAll debt securities issued by UCC are senior, unsecured, and unsubordinated and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by PLC and UNUS.\n\nIn March 2020, the SEC amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities, which we have adopted effective immediately. As noted above UCC and UNUS are 100% subsidiaries of Unilever PLC and are consolidated in the financial statements of the Unilever Group. In addition, there are no material assets in the guarantor entities apart from intercompany investments and balances. Therefore, as allowed under Rule 13-01, we have excluded the summarised information for each issuer and guarantor.\n\nThe guarantees provide that, in case of the failure of the relevant issuer to punctually make payment of any principal, premium or interest, each guarantor agrees to ensure such payment is made when due whether at the stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise. The guarantees also provide that the Trustee shall be paid any and all amounts due to it under the guarantee upon which the debt securities are endorsed.",
