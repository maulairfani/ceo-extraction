The regular meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December, and the extraordinary meeting took place in April.\n\nIn all of the meetings in 2020, the Board of Management reported on Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments.

The annual Allianz SE and the Group's consolidated financial statements including the respective auditor's reports, the half-yearly as well as the quarterly reports were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.\n\nOther focal points of reporting, in addition to the status and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, were strategic topics such as the implementation of the Allianz strategy 'Simplicity Wins'  with its three pillars 'Outperform', 'Transform' and 'Rebalance', the risk strategy, the Allianz Customer Model (ACM), and the IT strategy. In addition, the Supervisory Board was intensively involved in the Board of Management's planning for both the fiscal year 2021 and the three-year period from 2021 to 2023.

The Board of Management's verbal reports at the meetings were accompanied by written documents, which were sent to each member of the Supervisory Board in time for the relevant meeting. The Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board in writing about important events that occurred between meetings.

The committees prepare the consultations in plenary sessions as well as the adoption of resolutions. They can also adopt their own resolutions.

These reviews revealed no reasons for objection.

The annual financial statements of Allianz SE were prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards. PwC performed a review of the half-yearly financial report. In addition, PwC was also mandated to perform an audit of the market value balance sheet according to Solvency II as of 31 December 2020 for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members received the documentation relating to the annual financial statements and the auditor's reports from PwC on schedule. The preliminary financial statements and PwC's preliminary audit results were discussed in the Audit Committee on 17 February 2021 as well as in the Supervisory Board's plenary session on 18 February 2021. The finalized financial statements and PwC's audit reports (dated 22 February 2021) were reviewed by the Audit Committee on 3 March 2021 and in the Supervisory Board plenary session on 4 March 2021. The auditors participated in the discussions and presented key results from their audit. Particular emphasis was placed on the key audit matters described in the auditor's report and on the audit procedures performed. No material weaknesses in the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. There were no circumstances that might give cause for concern about the auditor's independence. In addition, the market value balance sheets dated 31 December 2020 for both Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as the respective PwC reports were reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nOn the basis of its own reviews of the annual Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements, the management and group management reports, and the recommendation for the appropriation of earnings, the Supervisory Board has raised no objections and agreed with the results of the PwC audit. It has also approved the Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Board of Management. The financial statements have thus been formally adopted. The Supervisory Board agrees with the Board of Management's proposal on the appropriation of earnings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to express its special thanks to all Allianz Group employees for their great personal commitment over the past fiscal year under the difficult conditions caused by the pandemic.\n\n## ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT OF THE COMBINED SEPARATE NON-FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nIn the financial year 2020, the company was required to issue a separate non-financial report. This report was combined for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. The Supervisory Board commissioned PwC to perform an assurance engagement of this report. All Supervisory Board members received the combined separate non-financial report and the independent practitioner's assurance report in due time. The report and PwC's assurance report were discussed in the plenary session of the Supervisory Board on 4 March 2021. PwC participated in these discussions and presented the results of their assurance engagement. Based on its own review of the combined separate non-financial report, the Supervisory Board did not raise any objections and approved by acknowledgement the results of the PwC assurance engagement.",

The  decrease  was  mainly  driven  by  the  intra-group transfer of the reinsurance business with Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company, a lower premium volume from Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE as well as effects from the COVID-19 pandemic.  In total, \u20ac 11,685 mn  (2019:  \u20ac 11,911 mn)  of  gross  premiums  came  from Property-Casualty reinsurance and \u20ac 543 mn (2019: \u20ac 473 mn) from Life/Health reinsurance.\n\nThe net retention ratio decreased to 91.8 % (2019: 93.9 %). Premiums earned (net) decreased to \u20ac 10,888 mn (2019: \u20ac 11,436 mn), mainly  driven  by  the  development  of  gross  premiums  written  and higher ceded premiums for retrocession.\n\nThe accident year claims ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance increased to 72.7 % (2019: 70.4 %). This was mainly driven by additional COVID-19 losses. The natural catastrophe losses of \u20ac 220 mn were under the prior year's amount (2019: \u20ac 355 mn) 1 .\n\nNatural catastrophes before retrocessions \u20ac mn\n\n|                                             | Losses for Allianz SE   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Major Events in 2020                        |                         |\n| Storm Sabine/Ciara, Europe                  | 68                      |\n| Storms, Eastern Australia                   | 59                      |\n| Storms, South Eastern Queensland, Australia | 19                      |\n| Storms, Eastern Queensland, Australia       | 18                      |\n| Storm Gloria, Southern Europe               | 14                      |\n| Severe Weather, Germany                     | 10                      |\n| Flooding, France                            | 8                       |\n| Thunderstorms, United Kingdom               | 8                       |\n| Tornado and Hail, North Italy               | 8                       |\n| Other                                       | 8                       |\n| Total                                       | 220                     |\n|                                             | Losses for Allianz SE   |\n| Major Events in 2019                        |                         |\n| Storms J\u00f6rn/Klaus, Germany                  | 111                     |\n| Typhoon Hagibis, Japan                      | 50                      |\n| Typhoon Faxai, Japan                        | 50                      |\n| Storm Eberhard, Northern and Western Europe | 38                      |\n| Bushfires, Australia                        | 37                      |\n| Storm Bernd, Germany                        | 24                      |\n| Tornado, Northern Italy                     | 12                      |\n| Storm Bennet, Northern and Western Europe   | 8                       |\n| Hailstorm, France                           | 7                       |\n| Flooding, Southern France                   | 6                       |\n| Other                                       | 12                      |\n| Total                                       | 355                     |\n\nThe run-off result (net) amounted to \u20ac 400 mn (2019: \u20ac (204) mn) and was mainly influenced by fire and property reinsurance (\u20ac 218 mn), credit and bond reinsurance (\u20ac 81 mn) as well as liability reinsurance (\u20ac 71 mn). As a result, the calendar year claims ratio (net) in PropertyCasualty reinsurance decreased to 69.0 % (2019: 72.3 %).\n\nThe expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance decreased to 29.5 % (2019: to 30.7 %), driven by a lower commission ratio of 28.6 % (2019: 29.8 %). The administrative expense ratio slightly increased to 1.0 % (2019: 0.9 %).\n\nIn Life/Health reinsurance, the net underwriting result increased to \u20ac 60 mn (2019: \u20ac (36) mn), mainly due to lower commissions.\n\nThe total net underwriting result amounted to \u20ac 140 mn (2019: \u20ac (397) mn), mainly driven by the positive development of the calendar year loss ratio in Property-Casualty reinsurance in 2020.",

This was partly offset by a higher profit transfer from Allianz Deutschland AG, which rose by \u20ac 126 mn to \u20ac 1,284 mn.\n\nIncome from affiliated enterprises  and participations grew by \u20ac 441 mn to \u20ac 4,487 mn, mainly because the dividend payment received from our subsidiary Allianz Europe B.V. increased by \u20ac 550 mn to \u20ac 3,950 mn in 2020.\n\nIncome  from  other  investments went  up  slightly  by  \u20ac 4 mn  to \u20ac 525 mn, mainly consisting of income from bonds (\u20ac 225 mn), funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed (\u20ac 150 mn) and intra-group loans (\u20ac 101 mn).\n\nRealized gains grew by \u20ac 37 mn to \u20ac 302 mn. This increase is primarily attributable to realized gains from the sale of bonds, which went up by \u20ac 39 mn to \u20ac 296 mn.\n\nIncome  from  reversal  of  impairments declined  by  \u20ac 69 mn  to \u20ac 25 mn, fully stemming from write-ups related to our bond portfolio (\u20ac 25 mn).\n\n## Expenses  for  the  management  of  investments,  interest,  and\n\nother investment-related expenses declined by \u20ac 19 mn to \u20ac 1,022 mn. This reduction was driven by lower interest expenses (\u20ac 55 mn) as a result of lower refinancing rates for the rollover of matured debt instruments. The overall decrease of this position was partly offset by higher investment-related expenses (\u20ac 36 mn).\n\nDepreciation and impairments of investments rose by \u20ac 307 mn to \u20ac 552 mn. The impairments in 2020 were particularly attributable to write-downs  on  shares  in  affiliated  enterprises  (\u20ac 251 mn),  bonds (\u20ac 152 mn) and investment funds (\u20ac 141 mn).\n\nRealized losses slightly  went  down  by \u20ac 6 mn to \u20ac 167 mn and were completely related to the sale of bonds (\u20ac 167 mn).\n\nExpenses  for  losses  taken  over significantly  increased  by \u20ac 551 mn to \u20ac 714 mn. This was primarily due to a higher loss taken over from Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE,  which grew by \u20ac 506 mn to \u20ac 518 mn. A higher loss taken over from our service provider Allianz Technology SE, which went up by \u20ac 22 mn to \u20ac 163 mn and a loss taken over from Allianz Direct Versicherungs-AG amounting to \u20ac 31 mn (2019: profit transfer of \u20ac 6 mn) also contributed to this increase.\n\n## OTHER NON-TECHNICAL RESULT\n\nThe other non-technical result improved significantly by \u20ac 623 mn to \u20ac (891) mn. This development was primarily driven by the foreign currency translation result, which improved by \u20ac 486 mn. For further information regarding other income and expenses, please refer to note 25.\n\n## TAXES AND NET INCOME\n\nAs far as legally permissible, Allianz SE acts as the controlling company ('Organtr\u00e4ger') of the German tax group that most German subsidiaries belong to. As the controlling company, Allianz SE is liable for the income taxes of this German tax group.\n\nAfter being offset against tax losses, the current tax charge of Allianz SE  amounted  to  \u20ac (250) mn  (2019:  \u20ac (67) mn).  Moreover, Allianz SE received a tax allocation of \u20ac 732 mn (2019: \u20ac 485 mn) by  Allianz SE  tax group companies that recorded taxable income. Taking into account other taxes, the income from taxes amounted to \u20ac 486 mn (2019: \u20ac 433 mn).\n\nNet income increased by \u20ac 5 mn to \u20ac 4,608 mn (2019: \u20ac 4,603 mn).",

        "page_content": "## Economic outlook 1\n\n2021 will be the year of the vaccine. The progress of the global vaccination campaign will be the decisive factor for the economic recovery from the pandemic. After a lackluster start into 2021 -  due to new COVID-19 restrictions in Europe and other parts of the world - a successful vaccination of vulnerable populations (20 - 40 % of the total) should set the stage for moderate growth in the second half of 2021. Main driver of the rebound will be the return of confidence, helping to restart the service economy, to unleash forced and precautionary savings, and to resume corporate investments. All in all, we expect global gross domestic product to expand by 4.6 % in 2021, with China setting the pace (+ 8.4 %) and the United States and the Eurozone registering more modest growth of 3.6 % and 4.3 %, respectively.\n\nThe downside risks are sizeable. First and foremost, vaccination hurdles on the demand side (vaccination skepticism) as well as the supply side (production and distribution bottlenecks) could easily derail the recovery/uni003B in that respect, the slow start to the vaccination rollout in Europe is not promising. Other risks include an unexpected strong bout of inflation, a premature withdrawal of fiscal and monetary support, a spike in insolvencies and social unrest in response to rising inequalities and poverty in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nIn our base case scenario, however, we expect policymakers to step up support to limit long-term scarring to the economy and provide a tailwind to the recovery. On the fiscal side, in Europe, safety net measures look set to be extended while in the United States stimulus spending will be stepped up in 2021. Meanwhile, central banks will continue with their bond purchases to ensure favorable refinancing rates to the public and the private sectors, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank maintaining record-low interest rates for the time being.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, equity markets have already consumed most of the optimism story and high valuations provide very little cushion against unexpected bad news. On the other hand, markets for safe assets, i.e., government bonds, embrace a more cautious stance. Our baseline scenario assumes a slight increase in yields due to reflationary expectations as the economic recovery unfolds.\n\n## Insurance industry outlook\n\nThe expected economic recovery and heightened risk awareness after the pandemic should give insurance markets some tailwinds in 2021. Premiums are likely to increase in some lines of business. One of the legacies  of  the  pandemic  that  will  shape  2021 (and  the  following years) is accelerated digitalization: digital processes and distribution channels will continue to become more relevant. Another legacy, less pleasant, are low or even negative interest rates, which have become even more entrenched. Thus, falling investment returns will impact industry profitability in 2021 and beyond.\n\nIn the non-life sector , premium growth is expected to return to precrisis levels, with emerging markets - and particularly China - outperforming advanced markets by a wide margin. Besides the recovery, another supportive factor is the ongoing hard market in commercial lines. On the other hand, investment income will remain under pressure and in some business lines claims from COVID-19 are likely to drag on.\n\nSocial inflation and impacts from natural catastrophes are other factors that could drive claims higher and thus require thorough claims management to preserve underwriting profitability.\n\nIn the life sector , premium income should largely rebound in 2021. This optimism is based on two observations: the pandemic should have raised the awareness of the need for risk cover, especially for healthcare and life insurance, and the lockdowns have swollen the amount of excess savings, parts of which might be used to bolster old-age provisions. But there are also reasons to be cautious: first and foremost, ultra-low interest rates, which will not only impact profitability but also continue to weigh on the demand for savings-type insurance products.\n\n## Business outlook\n\nOur outlook assumes no significant deviations from our underlying assumptions - specifically:\n\n- -Expected global economic recovery,\n- -Interest rates to remain at the current level,\n- -No major disruptions in the capital markets,\n- -No disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference,\n- -Level  of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average levels,\n- -An average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate of 1.17.\n\nAllianz SE provides a wide range of reinsurance coverage, primarily to Allianz  insurance entities (group-internal business), but also to thirdparty customers (external business). This includes Property-Casualty as well as Life/Health business on both a proportional and a nonproportional basis. Due to the broad spread of exposures underwritten by  line  of  business  and  geography,  Allianz SE's  portfolio  is  well diversified.\n\nAllianz Group uses Allianz SE, in particular, as a vehicle for actively managing its overall exposure to catastrophes. Under a group-wide risk management framework, each operating entity is responsible for controlling  its  exposure  to  individual  catastrophes  and  defining  its local reinsurance requirements, based on its local risk appetite and capital position. The respective cover is then provided by Allianz SE or one of its subsidiaries. At the Group level, the Allianz SE Board reviews and  approves  the  risk  appetite.  The  reinsurance  division  is  then responsible  for  designing  and  implementing  Group  catastrophe protection  within  given  exposure  limits.  These  covers  take  various forms and aim to protect the Group against excessive losses from major natural or man-made catastrophes. However, despite measures to limit or mitigate our risks there is still the potential for an unexpected frequency and/or severity of catastrophic events that may materially impact the results of Allianz SE. The top five residual risk exposures at the Group level are summarized in the paragraph 'Premium risk' in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nCompared  to  the  previous  year  plan  for  2020,  net  premiums earned were approximately 2 % lower than expected, mainly due to lower  than  planned  quota  share  cessions  from  European  Allianz entities.  Driven  by  COVID-19  related  losses,  the  combined  ratio exceeded plan by approximately 2 percentage points and,",

        "page_content": "consequently,  the  net  underwriting  result  before  change  in  claims equalization and similar reserves was lower than plan.\n\nAfter several years of rate decreases, rates started moderately hardening in 2020. Following pandemic-related underwriting losses during the course of 2020 and expected global natural catastrophe events  at  the  10-year  average  level,  the  trend  of  moderate  price increases  has  continued  with  2021  renewals.  We  expect  further improvements in risk-adjusted prices during the course of the year 2021.\n\nAllianz SE's  technical  result  largely  depends  on  group-internal cessions resulting from quota share agreements with European Allianz entities. Based on our estimates, we expect slightly higher premiums and  an  improved  net  underwriting  result  before  change  in  claims equalization  and  similar  reserves  for  the  property  and  casualty reinsurance in 2021. It should be noted that the actual result may vary significantly as the reinsurance business is, by nature, volatile in terms of frequency and severity of losses.\n\nCompared  to  our  outlook,  the  underwriting  result  and  the investment result deviated negatively for 2020 while we achieved an other non-technical result above plan. Overall, this resulted in both net income as well as net earnings being below our expectations. For 2021, we predict a slightly decreasing net income with almost stable net  earnings.  Based  on  our  current  expectation,  increases  in  the underwriting result and the investment result will be more than offset by a decrease in the other non-technical result. We are not planning a specific foreign currency result, nor are we able to anticipate any net gains/losses  from  derivatives.  These,  however,  could  considerably impact the net income of Allianz SE. Given the susceptibility of our nontechnical result to adverse capital market developments, we do not provide a precise outlook for the development of our net income. Nevertheless, we are ultimately planning and managing the Allianz SE net earnings in line with the Allianz Group's dividend policy. To this end, we take advantage of the opportunity to make use of the dividends of our subsidiaries, in particular those of Allianz Europe B.V., in order to generate net earnings for Allianz SE that match the dividend policy of Allianz Group. For more detailed information on our dividend policy, see the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2020 and www.allianz.com/dividend .\n\n## Management's overall assessment of the current economic situation of Allianz SE\n\nAt the date of issuance of this Annual Report, and based on current information  regarding  natural  catastrophes  and  capital  market trends - in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities - the Board of Management has no indication that Allianz SE is facing any major adverse developments.\n\n## Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements, such as prospects or expectations, that are based on management's current views and assumptions and subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results, performance figures, or events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.\n\nDeviations may arise due to changes in factors including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the general economic  and  competitive  situation  in  the  Allianz Group's  core  business  and  core  markets,  (ii)  the performance of financial markets (in particular market volatility, liquidity, and credit events), (iii) the frequency and severity of insured loss events, including those resulting from natural catastrophes, and the development of loss expenses, (iv) mortality and morbidity levels and trends, (v) persistency levels, (vi) particularly in the banking business, the extent of credit defaults, (vii) interest rate levels, (viii) currency exchange rates, most notably the EUR/USD exchange rate, (ix) changes in laws and regulations, including tax regulations, (x) the impact of acquisitions including and related integration issues and reorganization measures, and (xi) the general competitive conditions that, in each individual case, apply at a local, regional, national, and/or global level. Many of these changes can be exacerbated by terrorist activities.\n\n## No duty to update\n\nThe  Allianz Group  assumes  no  obligation  to  update  any  information  or  forward-looking  statement contained herein, save for any information we are required to disclose by law.",

The  combined  ratio  improved  to  94.4 %  (2019:  105.2 %), mainly due to a sharp decline in the accident year claims ratio to 68.2 % (2019:  77.6 %).  The  decline  is  mainly  influenced  by  a  lower  claims frequency. A strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac 416 mn (2019: release of \u20ac 24 mn) led to a net technical result of \u20ac (231) mn (2019: \u20ac (257) mn).\n\nThe household and homeowner reinsurance portfolio increased by 3.5 %, with gross premiums written of \u20ac 1,118 mn (2019: \u20ac 1,080 mn), mainly coming from business with Allianz IARD S.A. and Allianz Versicherungs-AG. The combined ratio improved to 83.0 % (2019: 90.1 %), driven by a decline in the accident year claims ratio to 54.6 % (2019: 61.4 %).  The  net  technical  result  increased  to  \u20ac 190 mn  (2019: \u20ac 103 mn).\n\nThe increase of the fire reinsurance portfolio is mainly caused by higher  internal  business  volume.  The  combined  ratio  improved  to 77.1 % (2019: 99.1 %), driven by a decrease of the calendar year claims ratio to 54.5 % (2019: 69.6 %) due to a higher run-off result of \u20ac 253 mn (2019:  \u20ac 100 mn) as well as a lower expense ratio of 22.7% (2019: 29.6 %).  After a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac 74 mn (2019: \u20ac 28 mn), the net technical result amounted to \u20ac 78 mn (2019: \u20ac (22) mn).\n\nEngineering reinsurance premiums written mainly increased due to its business with Allianz Benelux N.V. The combined ratio was at 91.6 % (2019: 97.0 %) and thus below the previous year and mainly driven\n\nby a positive run-off result of \u20ac 31 mn (2019: \u20ac (9) mn). The net technical result rose to \u20ac 34 mn (2019: \u20ac 12 mn).\n\nThe written premiums in the business interruption reinsurance increased by 8.1 % to \u20ac 255 mn (2019: \u20ac 236 mn) due to a higher external business  volume.  The  combined  ratio  rose  significantly  to  234.2 % (2019: 108.1 %), mainly due to the increase of the accident year claims ratio to 199.6 % (2019: 48.4 %) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The net technical result amounted to \u20ac (315) mn (2019: \u20ac (17) mn).\n\nOther property reinsurance includes extended coverage for fire and business interruption as well as hail, storm, water damage, livestock, burglary, and glass reinsurance. The premiums written declined slightly by 0.5 % due to a lower external business volume. Driven by a negative run-off result of \u20ac (55) mn (2019: \u20ac 54 mn), the combined ratio  increased  to  123.3 %  (2019:  109.1 %).  The  net  technical  result amounted to \u20ac (135) mn (2019: \u20ac (53) mn).\n\nPremiums written for liability reinsurance declined  by 9.7 % to \u20ac 1,169 mn  (2019:  \u20ac 1,295 mn),  mainly  driven  by  Allianz  Global Corporate & Specialty SE  which  caused a decrease of the written premiums  by  \u20ac 130 mn.  The  combined  ratio  improved  to  100.8 % (2019: 113.3 %), mainly due to a positive run-off result of \u20ac 71 mn (2019: \u20ac (350) mn). Driven by a release of the equalization reserve of \u20ac 12 mn (2019: \u20ac 161 mn), the net technical result amounted to \u20ac (8) mn (2019: \u20ac (5) mn).\n\nThe premium revenue of personal accident reinsurance rose by 3.2 %, mainly driven by internal business. The combined ratio worsened to 84.3 % (2019: 75.9 %),  driven by a lower run-off result of \u20ac 17 mn",

Despite  a strengthening of the equalization reserve of \u20ac 65 mn (2019: release of \u20ac 42 mn),  the  net  technical  result  was  positive  at  \u20ac 10 mn  (2019: \u20ac (6) mn).\n\nIn life reinsurance , the premium revenue increased to \u20ac 375 mn (2019: \u20ac 317 mn), mainly driven by external business. The net technical result rose to \u20ac 58 mn (2019: \u20ac (34) mn), mainly driven by a decline of the commission costs that were negatively influenced by an initial commission for a new reinsurance contract last year.\n\nThe premium revenue of legal expenses reinsurance declined slightly by 1.0 % to \u20ac 262 mn (2019: \u20ac 265 mn), driven by Allianz Elementar Versicherungs-AG (\u20ac (10) mn). On the other hand the premium income with Allianz Versicherungs-AG increased by \u20ac 7 mn. The combined ratio increased to 118.9 % (2019: 102.0 %) due to an increase in the calendar year claims ratio to 82.8 % (2019: 66.7 %), stemming from a higher accident year claims ratio and a lower run-off result. Despite a release of the equalization reserve with an amount of \u20ac 31 mn (2019: \u20ac 9 mn), the net technical result decreased to \u20ac (18) mn (2019: \u20ac 5 mn).\n\nGross premiums written in credit and bond reinsurance decreased by 36.9 % to \u20ac 198 mn (2019: \u20ac 314 mn) mainly caused by the decline of the premium income amounting to \u20ac 119 mn from Euler Hermes Reinsurance AG. This development resulted mainly from the Coronarelated state scheme ('Corona-Schutzschirm') granted by the German government. Driven by a lower calendar year claims ratio of 36.2 % (2019: 50.2 %), the combined ratio improved to 87.8 % (2019: 90.5 %). The net technical result amounted to \u20ac 164 mn (2019: \u20ac 35 mn) after a higher release of the equalization reserve of \u20ac 135 mn (2019: \u20ac 6 mn).\n\nIn health reinsurance the premium revenue increased by 7.4 % to \u20ac 167 mn (2019: \u20ac 156 mn), mainly driven by external business. The net technical result rose slightly to \u20ac 2 mn (2019: \u20ac (1) mn).\n\nOther reinsurance lines include:\n\n- -emergency assistance,\n- -fidelity & political risk,\n- -motor extended warranty,\n- -other property and casualty business.",

More details regarding this position are explained in note 5 to our financial statements.\n\nOther investments rose from \u20ac 29.4 bn to \u20ac 34.2 bn, reflecting increases in debt securities (\u20ac 3.7 bn), investment funds (\u20ac 0.6 bn), loans (\u20ac 0.4 bn) and deposits with banks (\u20ac 0.2 bn).\n\nAt the end of 2020, \u20ac 28.5 bn of other investments were invested in debt securities, of which \u20ac 11.3 bn were government bonds. We\n\nraised our overall government bond exposure by \u20ac 1.4 bn compared to year-end 2019, thereby increasing our investments in Spanish and Italian government bonds from \u20ac 0.8 bn to \u20ac 0.9 bn and from \u20ac 0.3 bn to \u20ac 0.8 bn, respectively.\n\n## Funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed\n\nincreased to \u20ac 13.1 bn (2019: \u20ac 11.0 bn). This increase was mainly due to a new life reinsurance contract with Allianz Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A. Allianz SE completely retroceded this portfolio.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the fair value of investments amounted to \u20ac 148.6 bn (2019: \u20ac 139.8 bn), compared to a carrying amount of \u20ac 121.1 bn (2019:  \u20ac 115.1 bn). The increase of valuation reserves to \u20ac 27.5 bn (2019: \u20ac 24.7 bn) is primarily driven by higher fair values of bonds held by Allianz SE directly and by our subsidiaries due to the decline of market interest rates. Accordingly, the overall rise of valuation reserves is mostly attributable to higher net asset values of our shares in affiliated enterprises.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables decreased from \u20ac 5.4 bn to \u20ac 4.8 bn, driven by a decline of \u20ac 0.3 bn in other receivables and of \u20ac 0.4 bn in receivables on reinsurance business. The reduction in other receivables mainly resulted from lower cash pool receivables of \u20ac 0.1 bn.\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, our shareholders'  equity remained at the prior year level and amounted to \u20ac 40.4 bn (2019: \u20ac 40.4 bn). A buyback of own shares at acquisition costs of nearly \u20ac 0.8 bn led to a decrease. The shares were cancelled without reducing the issued capital. This decrease was partly offset by a rise of \u20ac 0.7 bn, due to net income being higher than the dividend paid and due to the sale of own shares for Employee Stock Purchase Plans. The net income remained at the prior year level and amounted to \u20ac 4.6 bn. A lower investment result was  offset  by  a  better  other  non-technical  result.  \u20ac 0.8 bn  (2019: \u20ac 0.9 bn) were transferred from the net income to the revenue reserves.\n\nThe Board of Management proposes to use the net earnings of \u20ac 4,376 mn for dividend payments in the amount of \u20ac 3,956 mn. 1 The unappropriated earnings of \u20ac 420 mn will be carried forward.\n\nOur disclosures concerning treasury shares as required in our financial statements in accordance with \u00a7 160 (1) No. 2 AktG can be found in note 12.\n\n- 1\\_The proposal reflects the number of shares entitled to the dividend as of 31 December 2020.",

Main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE are dividends and funds received from subsidiaries, reinsurance premiums received, and funding provided by capital markets. Liquidity resources are  defined as readily available assets - specifically cash, money  market  investments,  and  highly  liquid  government  bonds. Funds  are  primarily  used  for  paying  interest  expenses  on  our  debt funding, claims arising from the reinsurance business, operating costs, internal and external growth investments, and dividends to our shareholders.\n\n## Funding Sources\n\nAllianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors such as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE are both equity and debt funding. Equity can be raised by issuing ordinary no-par value shares. The issuance of debt in various maturities as well as group-wide liquidity management are the main sources of our debt funding.\n\n## SHARE CAPITAL\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the share capital registered at the Commercial  Register  was  \u20ac 1,169,920,000. This was divided into 412,293,128 no-par value shares. As of 31 December 2020, Allianz SE held 247,489 (2019: 595,677) own shares.\n\nAllianz SE has the option to increase its share capital base according to authorizations provided by the AGM. The following table outlines Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2020:\n\n## Capital authorizations of Allianz SE\n\n| Capital authorization            | Nominal amount   | Expiry date of   the authorization   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Authorized Capital  2018/I 1     | \u20ac 334,960,000    | 8 May 2023                           |\n| Authorized Capital  2018/II 2    | \u20ac 15,000,000     | 8 May 2023                           |\n| Conditional Capital  2010/2018 3 | \u20ac 250,000,000    | 8 May 2023                           |\n\n- 1\\_For issuance of shares against contribution in cash and/or in kind, with the authorization to exclude shareholders' subscription rights.\n- 2\\_For issuance of shares to employees with exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights.\n- 3\\_To  cover  convertible  bonds,  bonds  with  warrants,  convertible  participation  rights,  participation  rights,  and subordinated financial instruments, each with the authorization to exclude shareholders' subscription rights.\n\nFor further details on Allianz SE's authorized and conditional capital, please refer to note 12 to our financial statements.\n\n## DEBT FUNDING\n\nThe cost and availability of debt funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or to Allianz SE. Our main sources of debt funding are senior and subordinated bonds. Among others, money market securities,  letter-of-credit facilities and bank credit  lines allow Allianz SE to fine-tune its capital structure.\n\nIn 2020, we issued a \u20ac 1.0 bn subordinated bond in May and a dual  tranche  of  subordinated  bonds  in  November  amounting  to \u20ac 1.25 bn and USD 1.25 bn each. Subordinated liabilities overall increased to \u20ac 16.6 bn (2019: \u20ac 13.4 bn) at year-end.\n\nOther financial liabilities decreased to \u20ac 38.8 bn (2019: \u20ac 39.4 bn), mainly as a result of lower other third-party financial liabilities. For further details on Allianz SE's financial liabilities, please refer to notes 13 and 16 to our financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT\n\n## Target and strategy of risk management\n\nAllianz SE aims to ensure that it is adequately capitalized at all times for the benefit of both shareholders and policyholders. This includes meeting the Solvency II regulatory capital requirements resulting from the internal model.\n\nWe closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of Allianz SE and apply regular stress tests (including standardized, historical  and reverse stress test scenarios). These analyses allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency strength. For example, risk capital is allocated to reinsurance business segments and reflected as cost of capital in our pricing tools. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the  risk and business strategy by the fact that business decisions to achieve our set targets are taken within the determined risk appetite. Implemented sound processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continous alignment between the risk and business strategy and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations.\n\nIn addition, the liquidity risk management framework of Allianz SE ensures that our liquidity risks are managed and a sufficient liquidity position is maintained under both market conditions (expected as well as stressed) and business conditions.\n\n## Risk governance system\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, we consider risk management to be a core competency and an integral part of our business. Our risk management framework covers all operations and business units of Allianz SE in proportion to the inherent risks of the activities, ensuring that risks across Allianz SE are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed, and adequately managed. The key elements of our risk management framework are:\n\n- -Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a robust risk governance structure.\n- -Consistent application of an integrated risk capital framework to protect our capital base and support effective capital management.\n- -Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into management and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allocating capital to the business units.\n\nOur risk management system is based on the following four pillars:\n\nRisk identification and underwriting: A robust system of risk identification and underwriting forms the foundation for adequate risk and management decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwriting,  valuation  methods,  individual  transaction  approvals, emerging-/operational-/top-risk  assessments,  liquidity  risk  and  scenario analyses, among others.\n\nRisk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk appetite consistently with our business strategy. It ensures that rewards are appropriate based on the taken risks and the required capital. It also ensures  that delegated decision-making authorities are in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.\n\nRisk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework provides management with the transparency needed to assess whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits, and to identify emerging issues and risks quickly. For example, risk dashboard and limit utilization reports as well as scenario analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.\n\nCommunication  and  transparency: Transparent  risk  disclosure provides the basis for communicating our strategy and performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens risk awareness and our risk culture throughout Allianz SE.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nAllianz SE's business strategy is aligned with and mainly driven by the strategy of Allianz Group. Allianz SE's main tasks are the ownership of legal entities, in particular subsidiaries, the provision of central financing functions, and offering reinsurance services to mostly internal but also external counterparties.\n\n## ALLIANZ GROUP'S BUSINESS ASPIRATIONS\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following objectives  for  Allianz Group's medium-term strategy with the motto 'Simplicity wins':\n\n- -Outperform: We seek to move ahead of our competitors, both traditional businesses and disruptors.\n- -Transform: We seek to become simpler and deeply digital, and to make our businesses more scalable.\n- -Rebalance: We seek to build leading positions in large, profitable, and fast-growing geographies as well as in new areas of business.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated some trends that shape the insurance markets. The altered environment has reinforced many of the strategic priorities of Allianz Group and therefore also for Allianz SE as the Holding Company. These are, for example, digital by default, simplification,  rebalancing of product portfolios, and transformation towards higher resilience and agility. The COVID-19 pandemic also affects the reinsurance business segment. The extent to which claims from the pandemic are covered by existing reinsurance strongly depends on individual contract wording. However, reinsurance rates are rising in general as the market is characterized by an overall hardening. Business areas such as cyber coverage are experiencing greater demand. Cover for pandemic risks is generally not in the risk appetite of the reinsurance division and is only granted after a strict review and with clear limits.",

        "page_content": "## ALLIANZ GROUP'S BUSINESS STRATEGY\n\nWith regard to these strategic objectives, the Allianz SE's Board of Management has defined a number of strategic priorities for Allianz Group, and is implementing initiatives and programs to address the five dimensions of the Renewal Agenda also for Allianz SE:\n\n- -True Customer Centricity: Design intuitive products and processes to achieve loyalty leadership in our core markets.\n- -Digital by Default: Build legacy-free platforms with automated core processes.\n- -Technical Excellence: Move to data-driven product design, pricing, and claims handling.\n- -Growth Engines: Systematically exploit new sources for profitable growth.\n- -Inclusive Meritocracy: Reinforce a culture where both people and performance matter.\n\nAllianz SE's Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on protecting the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.\n\n## OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe  Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's financial strength, coupled with ongoing transformation, renders us resilient and allows us to benefit from new opportunities in a fast-changing business environment.\n\nAllianz SE's role - as laid out in our business strategy - includes providing central financing functions to Allianz Group companies, and acting as a reinsurer with predominantly group-internal business. Opportunities management is principally a responsibility for the Allianz Group's primary insurance and asset management entities.\n\nAllianz SE's activities in support of Allianz Group's opportunity management fall mainly in the following areas:\n\n- -Supporting  the  companies'  efforts  for  better  customer  understanding and evolving data analytics techniques via development of centralized expertise in data analytics, product design, and distribution platforms.\n- -Supporting  Allianz  Group's growth strategy via provision of financing for acquisition of M&A targets.\n- -Reinsurance Pooling from Group companies and optimization via retrocessions,  as well as reinsurance solutions to optimize their capital needs.\n\nFor a detailed description of the Allianz Group's opportunities see the annual reports of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe  pooling  of  internal  reinsurance  on  the  balance  sheet  of Allianz SE is an important strategic initiative which has been pursued for many years. As a Group reinsurer, the reinsurance division not only provides guidance and tools to Group companies to manage exposures as effectively as possible, but also provides most of the reinsurance covers to Group companies. The large and well diversified portfolio at Allianz SE allows for acceptances of a wide range of reinsurance structures including proportional and non-proportional contracts. Furthermore, net quota shares as well as adverse development covers  (ADC)  contribute to a very balanced portfolio at Allianz SE.\n\nLarger risk concentrations are actively managed via retrocessions on a per risk and per event basis in order to protect our capital and increase the return on equity.\n\nDue to the vast amount of expert know-how at Allianz SE important services to Group companies are provided, for example, via the reinsurance division for the MidCorp business segment with tools for pricing, accumulation management and loss control engineering services, or via the Global P&C and Global Life units for their respective business segments.\n\nIn 2020, Allianz SE also supported Group efforts for simplification and digitalization, among others by building centralized expertise in  product  development,  digital  distribution  platforms,  and  claims management.\n\nFor  further  details  on  opportunities  envisaged  by  Allianz SE, please refer to the section 'Business Outlook'.\n\n## Risk governance structure\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD AND BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nAllianz SE's approach to risk governance ensures that our risk profile remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.\n\nWithin  our  risk  governance  system,  Allianz SE's  Supervisory Board  and  the  Board  of  Management  have  both  Allianz SE  and group-wide responsibilities. The Board of Management formulates business objectives and  a corresponding risk strategy/uni003B the core elements of the risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy  approved  by  the  Board  of  Management,  which  together with the Allianz SE-specific appendix also serves as the master risk policy for Allianz SE. The Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the execution of its management  activities.  The  following  committees  support  the  Board  of Management and the Supervisory Board on risk issues.\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD RISK COMMITTEE\n\nThe Risk Committee reports to the Supervisory Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management. It monitors the effectiveness of Allianz SE's risk management framework. Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as the general risks and specific risk exposures and ensures that the business strategy is aligned with the risk strategy.\n\nFor more information please refer to the paragraph 'Risk Committee' in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\n## GROUP FINANCE AND RISK COMMITTEE\n\nThe Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) provides oversight of the Group's and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, is the limit-setting  authority  within  the  framework  set  by  the  Board  of Management, and approves major financing, reinsurance and capital management transactions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management  with  recommendations  regarding  Allianz SE's  capital",

        "page_content": "structure, capital allocation, liquidity position, and investment strategy, including the sub-portfolio strategic asset allocations.\n\n## OVERALL RISK ORGANIZATION AND ROLES IN RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nA comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appetite,  limit  systems,  documentation,  and  reporting.  These  standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of risk-related information and a disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution.\n\nAs a general principle, the responsibility for the 'First Line of Defense' rests with business managers in the business units of Allianz SE. They are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their decisions. Our 'Second Line of Defense' is made up of independent oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the Board of Management in defining the risk framework within which the business can operate. Audit forms the 'Third Line of  Defense',  independently and regularly reviewing Allianz SE's risk governance  implementation,  compliance  with  risk  principles,  performing  quality reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards, including the internal control framework. Allianz SE has established dedicated responsibilities for the three lines of defense at its departments (including reinsurance).\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION\n\nThe function of the Chief Risk Officer for both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE is performed by the same person. Independent risk oversight for Allianz SE is performed by risk control units within Group Risk and within the reinsurance department of Allianz SE. The risk management function supports Allianz SE's Board of Management, including its committees, by performing various analyses, communicating risk management related information, and in preparing and implementing committee decisions.\n\nThe  risk  management  function  also  supports  the  Board  of Management in developing the risk management framework - which covers risk governance, risk strategy, and appetite - and risk monitoring and reporting. The risk management function's operational responsibilities encompass assessing risks and monitoring limits and accumulations of specific risks across business units and business lines, including natural and man-made disasters and exposures to financial markets and counterparties.\n\n## OTHER FUNCTIONS AND BODIES\n\nIn addition to the risk management function for Allianz SE, Allianz SE's legal, compliance, and actuarial functions constitute additional components of the 'Second Line of Defense'.\n\nAllianz SE's legal and compliance functions seek to mitigate legal risks for Allianz SE with support from other departments. The objectives of both functions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation affecting Allianz SE, and to provide legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes. In addition, Compliance - in conjunction with Legal and other experts involved -  is responsible for integrity management, which aims to protect Allianz SE and employees from regulatory risks.\n\nAllianz SE's actuarial function contributes towards assessing and managing risks in line with regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks includes, among others, the calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance in business planning, reporting and monitoring of the results, and supporting the effective implementation of the risk management system.\n\n## Risk-based steering and risk management\n\nAllianz SE is exposed to a variety of risks through its holding function and reinsurance activities, including market, credit, underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\nAllianz SE considers diversification across different lines of business and regions to be an important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event and contributes to relatively stable results. Our aim is to maintain a balanced risk profile without any  disproportionately large risk concentrations and accumulations.\n\nWith  Solvency II  being  the  regulatory  regime  relevant  for Allianz SE  since  1 January 2016,  our  risk  profile  is  measured  and steered based on our approved Solvency II internal model. We have introduced a target solvency ratio in accordance with Solvency II, supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses. By that, we allow for a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line with the Solvency II framework.\n\nAllianz SE steers its portfolio taking a comprehensive view at risk and return, which is based on the internal model and is supported by scenario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by limits based on our internal model or other considerations. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the return on risk capital 1 (RoRC) is regularly conducted and translated for the underwriting of property and casualty reinsurance business. The RoRC is an indicator for new business and allows us to identify profitable lines of new business on a sustainable basis, and thus is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions.\n\nAs a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in business steering, and its application satisfies the so-called 'use test' requirement under Solvency II.\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, Allianz SE  holds  and  uses  a  broad  range  of  financial  instruments, which are reflected on our balance sheet as both assets and liabilities.\n\nFor our holding activities (i.e., to hold participations, provide financing for Group companies, cover internal pension liabilities, invest cash pooled from subsidiaries, and as the lender of last resort within Allianz Group), Allianz SE predominantly invests in participations and fixed-income assets. As an inherent part of our reinsurance operations, we collect premiums from our customers and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The resulting reinsurance investment portfolio backs the future claims and benefits to our cedents. In addition, we also invest shareholders'  capital, which is required to support the underwritten risks and the holding activities. Our market risk from liabilities primarily",

        "page_content": "relates to fixed-income instruments held for financing as well as to internal pensions and reinsurance liabilities. Finally, we use derivatives for various purposes.  A principal example would be the hedging of planned dividend income from non-Euro subsidiaries against adverse currency market movements. In the case of high capital market volatility,  or especially adverse market conditions, Allianz SE may also undertake hedge overlays to support the solvency of Allianz Group. Generally, the use of derivatives at Allianz SE is for the purpose of risk reduction. Guidelines are in place regarding the use of derivatives, for which adherence is monitored by the risk management function of Allianz SE.  Asset/liability  management  (ALM)  decisions  are  taken based on the internal model, considering both the risks and the returns on the financial markets.\n\nAs the fair values of our assets and liabilities depend on changes in the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. Allianz SE's most important market risk results from changes in the value of its participations in Group companies. The long-dated internal pension liabilities of German Group companies on Allianz SE's balance sheet contribute to interest rate risk, in particular as they cannot be fully matched by available investments due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation, implied volatilities, and currency values, which might impact the value of our assets and liabilities.\n\nTo measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models 1 for the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for all risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the portfolio profit and loss distribution at a confidence level of 99.5 % defines the market Value at Risk (VaR).\n\nMarket  risk  from  Allianz SE's  material  M&A  transactions  is evaluated by assessing risk capital implications.\n\nStrategic  asset  allocation  benchmarks  are  defined  for  several sub-portfolios of Allianz SE's investment portfolio. Furthermore, we have risk limits in place, including financial VaR, stand-alone equity and interest  rate sensitivity limits, and foreign-exchange exposure limits. Limits are closely monitored and, if a breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include the escalation to certain decisionmaking bodies and/or the closing of positions.\n\nFinally, guidelines are in place regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives.\n\n## EQUITY RISK\n\nAllianz SE's equity risk predominantly results from the performance of our strategic insurance participations. Other material risk exposures reflect listed and unlisted equities, equity derivatives, own shares, and management incentive plans.\n\nRisks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As the performance  of  our  participations  might  exceed  expectations  and stock values also might increase, opportunities may arise from participations and other equity investments.\n\nIn 2020,  Allianz SE had in place profit-and-loss transfer agreements  with  fourteen  German  subsidiaries.  These  are  listed  in  the\n\nparagraph 'Legal obligations' in the appendix. Risk from these contracts is reflected via the risk capital calculation on participations.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nIf the duration of our assets is shorter than our liabilities, we may suffer an economic loss in the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts.\n\nBy contrast, opportunities may arise when interest rates increase. Interest rate risk is managed within our ALM process and controlled via an interest rate sensitivity limit.\n\n## CREDIT SPREAD RISK\n\nFixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads widen.  However,  our  risk  appetite  for  credit  spread  risk  takes  into account the underlying economics of our reinsurance business model. As  a  liability-driven  investor,  we  typically  hold  fixed-income  assets covering reinsurance liabilities until maturity. This implies that we are economically less affected by short-term changes in market prices.\n\n## INFLATION RISK\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a reinsurance company, we are exposed to changing inflation rates. Since inflation increases reinsurance claims and costs as well as internal pension obligations, higher inflation rates will lead to greater liabilities.\n\nInflation assumptions are taken into account in our reinsurance underwriting. However, an unexpected rising rate of inflation will increase both future claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities. Conversely, if future inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower than anticipated. The risk of changing inflation rates is incorporated in our internal model.\n\n## CURRENCY RISK\n\nThe major part of Allianz SE's foreign currency risk results from our ownership  of  non-Euro  Group  companies.  In  addition  to  this  risk, Allianz SE's currency risk is driven by its non-Euro reinsurance exposure, as well as by the use of foreign currency bonds as external financing instruments.\n\nIf the Euro strengthens, the Euro-equivalent net asset value of our foreign  subsidiaries  and  the  value  of  our  non-EUR  financing  instruments will decline from Allianz SE's perspective/uni003B at the same time, however,  capital  requirements  in  Euro  will  decrease,  partially  mitigating the total impact on the capitalization of Allianz SE.\n\nAn additional important source of currency risk is the planned dividend income from non-Euro subsidiaries.\n\nAllianz SE's currency risk is monitored and managed based on our foreign exchange management limit framework.\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\nCredit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality of our counterparties ('migration risk') or the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations ('default risk').\n\nAllianz SE's credit risk profile comes from three sources: our investment portfolio, guarantees and retrocession.",

        "page_content": "Investment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and receivables, whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality of the obligor.\n\nGuarantees: Credit risk is caused by the potential default of Group companies  on  commitments  from  contracts  with  external  stakeholders, which are backed with guarantees from Allianz SE.\n\nRetrocession: Credit risk to external reinsurers arises when parts of Allianz SE's reinsurance business are retroceded to external reinsurance companies to mitigate risks. Credit risk arises from potential losses from non-recoverability of reinsurance receivables, or due to default on benefits under in-force reinsurance treaties. Our retrocession  partners are carefully selected by a team of specialists. Besides focusing on companies with a strong credit rating, we may further require letters of credit, cash deposits, or other financial measures to further mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major drivers of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at default, rating,  seniority,  collateral,  and  maturity.  Additional  parameters assigned  to  obligors  are  migration  probabilities  and  obligor  asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined assignment process. Central components of this assignment process are long-term ratings from external rating agencies and internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative information available is applied.\n\nThe loss profile of the portfolio is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation,  taking  into  account  interdependencies  and  exposure concentrations per obligor segment.\n\nTo ensure effective credit risk management, a credit VaR limit is derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the lower investment grade and non-investment grade area.\n\nOur group-wide country and obligor group limit management framework (CRisP 1 ) allows us to manage counterparty concentration risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the levels of the Group and of Allianz SE. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions on credit actions. Clearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed.\n\n## UNDERWRITING RISK\n\nAllianz SE's underwriting risk consists of premium risk and reserve risk in the Property-Casualty reinsurance business as well as of biometric risk from internal pensions and the Life/Health reinsurance business.\n\n## PROPERTY-CASUALTY\n\nOur Property-Casualty reinsurance business is exposed to premium risk related to adverse developments in the current year's new and renewed business as well as to reserve risk related to the business in force.\n\nAs  part  of  our  Property-Casualty  reinsurance  operations,  we receive  premiums  from  our  customers  and  provide  insurance protection in return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios.\n\nPremium  risk  is  subdivided  into  three  categories:  natural catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including manmade catastrophes.\n\nAllianz SE actively manages premium risk. The assessment of risks as  part  of  the  underwriting  process  is  a  key  element  of  our  risk management  framework.  There  are  clear  underwriting  guidelines, limits, and restrictions in place. Excessive risks are mitigated by external retrocession agreements. All these measures contribute to a limitation of risk accumulation. We also monitor concentrations and accumulation of non-market risks on a stand-alone basis (i.e., before diversification effects) within an Allianz Group global limit framework in order to avoid substantial losses from single events such as natural catastrophes and from man-made catastrophes such as terror or large industrial risk accumulations.\n\nPremium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are used to derive claims distributions and consider the features of our reinsurance contracts (e.g., shares, limits, reinstatements, and commissions). Non-catastrophe risks are modeled using attritional loss models for frequency losses as well as frequency and severity models for large losses. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, storms, and floods, represent  a significant challenge for risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, characteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. For significant exposures where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based  approaches  to  estimate  potential  losses.  Similar approaches  are  used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror and man-made catastrophes including losses from cyber incidents and industrial concentrations.\n\nThese loss distributions are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\nReserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in bestestimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. Allianz SE estimates and holds reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not yet been settled. In case of unexpected negative developments, we would experience a financial loss.\n\nReserve risk can also be mitigated by retrocession. We constantly monitor the development of reserves for reinsurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, Allianz SE conducts annual reserve uncertainty analyses based on similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. Where appropriate, the expertise and analysis of other Group entities is leveraged. The Allianz Group performs regular independent reviews of these analyses.\n\nSimilar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on actuarial models. The reserve distributions derived are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\n## LIFE/HEALTH\n\nUnderwriting risks in Allianz SE's Life/Health reinsurance operations and from our internal pension obligations (biometric risks) include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality, disability, and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected increase in the",

        "page_content": "occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims. Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and pension contracts might not be sufficient due to longer life expectancies of the insured persons.\n\nLife/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower than  expected.  As  profitability  calculations  are  based  on  several parameters - such as historical loss information and assumptions on inflation, mortality or morbidity - parameters realized may differ from the ones used for the calculation of pension liabilities and for underwriting.  For  example,  higher-than-expected  inflation  may  lead  to higher medical claims in the future. However, beneficial deviations are also possible/uni003B for example, a lower morbidity rate than expected will most likely result in lower claims.\n\nWe  measure  risks  within  our  internal  risk  capital  model, distinguishing, where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and trend development of actuarial parameter assumptions on the one hand and pandemic risk scenarios on the other.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nOperational risks represent losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, system failures, and external events, and can stem from a wide variety of sources, for example:\n\n- -The  category  'execution,  delivery  and  process  management' describes  potential  losses  arising  from  transaction  or  process management  failures.  Examples  include  interest  and  penalties from non-payment or underpayment of taxes. These losses tend to occur with little financial impact (although single large loss events can occur).\n- -The category 'clients, products & business practices' includes potential losses due to a failure to meet the professional obligations, or from the design of transactions. Examples include antitrust behavior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes. These losses can have a high financial impact/uni003B however, they tend to occur rarely.\n- -'Other operational risks' include, for example, internal and external fraud, financial misstatement risk, and information security incidents causing business disruption or fines. Potential failures at our outsourcing  partners can also cause a disruption to our working environment.\n\nIn view of Allianz SE's tasks as holding company for Allianz Group and reinsurer, the operational risk capital of Allianz SE is dominated by the risk of potential losses within the areas of 'execution, delivery and process management'  and  'clients, products & business practices'. Operational risk capital is calculated using a scenario approach based on expert judgment as well as internal and external operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of potential loss events for each material operational risk category are assessed and used as the basis for our internal model calibration.\n\nAllianz SE  has  implemented  a  group-wide  operational  risk management framework that focuses on the early recognition and proactive management of material operational risks. The framework defines roles and responsibilities as well as management processes and methods. An important component of this framework is the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), which ensures that effective controls or other risk mitigation activities are in place for all significant operational risks. Risk managers in the Allianz SE risk management\n\nfunction, in their capacity as the 'Second Line of Defense',  identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficiencies via a dialog with the 'First Line of Defense', and in close interaction with both the other 'Second Line of Defense' functions at Allianz SE and with the audit function.\n\nIn the IRCS approach, risk identification, assessment and controls vary  between  the  different  operational  risk  sources  reporting, compliance  and  operations.  For  example,  compliance  risks  are addressed  via written policies. The risk of financial misstatement is mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting. Outsourcing risks are covered by an Outsourcing Policy, by Service Level Agreements, and by Business Continuity and Crisis Management programs  to  protect  critical  business  functions  from  these  events. Cyber risks are mitigated through investments in cyber security, cyber insurance  Allianz SE buys from third party insurers, and a variety of ongoing control activities.\n\nOperational risk events are reported in a central database.\n\n## BUSINESS RISK\n\nAllianz SE's business risk comprises of cost risk from Property-Casualty reinsurance business as well as policyholder behavior risk from both Life/Health and Property-Casualty reinsurance.\n\nCost risk is associated with the risk that administration expenses are higher than expected, or that the new business volume decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz SE to cover its fixed costs.\n\nAssumptions  on  policyholder  behavior  are  set  in  line  with accepted actuarial methods and are based on our own historical data, if and as available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment.\n\nReflecting the business model of Allianz SE as primarily a groupinternal reinsurer, business risk is minor.\n\n## OTHER RISKS (NOT COVERED BY THE INTERNAL MODEL)\n\nThere are certain risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated by additional capital and are therefore not considered in the internal risk capital model. For the identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks, we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity and reputational risk.\n\n## STRATEGIC RISK\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company's value arising from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their implementation.\n\nStrategic  risks  are  identified  and  evaluated  as  part  of  the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's Top Risk Assessment processes and discussed in various Board of Management-level committees (e.g., the Group Finance and Risk Committee). We also monitor market and competitive conditions, capital market requirements, regulatory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe most important strategic risks are directly addressed through Allianz's Renewal Agenda, which focuses on True Customer Centricity, Digital by Default, Technical Excellence, Growth Engines and Inclusive Meritocracy. Progress on mitigating strategic risks and meeting the Renewal  Agenda  objectives  are  monitored  and  evaluated  in  the",

Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows.\n\nThe investment strategy of Allianz SE particularly focuses on the quality of investments and ensures a significant portion of liquid assets in  the  portfolio  (for  example,  high-rated  government  or  covered bonds). We employ actuarial methods for estimating our liabilities arising from reinsurance  and internal pension contracts. In our liquidity planning process, we reconcile liquidity sources (such as dividends received from subsidiaries, cash from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (including payments due to dividends to shareholders, reinsurance claims and expenses) under a best-estimate plan as well as under idiosyncratic and systemic adverse liquidity scenarios.\n\nThe main goal of planning and managing Allianz SE's liquidity position is to ensure that we are always in a position to meet payment obligations.  To  comply  with  this  objective,  the  liquidity  position  of Allianz SE is monitored and forecasted on a daily basis.\n\nAllianz SE's  short-term  liquidity  is  managed  within  Allianz SE's cash pool, which serves as a central tool also for investing the excess liquidity of other Group companies. The accumulated short-term liquidity forecast is updated daily. The cash position in this portfolio is subject to an absolute minimum liquidity threshold and an absolute target liquidity threshold. Both thresholds are defined for the Allianz SE cash pool in order to be protected against short-term liquidity crises.\n\nAs part of our liquidity stress testing framework, contingent liquidity requirements and sources of liquidity are taken into account to ensure that Allianz SE is able to meet any future payment obligations  even under adverse conditions. Major contingent liquidity requirements  include  non-availability  of  external  capital  markets, combined market and catastrophe risk scenarios for subsidiaries as well as lower than expected profit transfers and dividends from subsidiaries.\n\nIn order to protect Allianz Group against the liquidity impact of adverse risk events beyond those covered by the capital and liquidity buffers at our subsidiaries, Allianz SE holds a strategic liquidity reserve for which the target level is re-evaluated annually.\n\nThe strategic liquidity planning for Allianz SE covering the time horizons  of one calendar year (more granular) and three calendar years is regularly reported to the Board of Management.\n\n## REPUTATIONAL RISK\n\nAllianz SE's reputation as a well-respected and socially aware holding and reinsurance company is influenced by our behavior in a range of  areas,  such  as  financial  performance,  quality  of  reinsurance underwriting and customer service, corporate governance, employee relations, intellectual capital and corporate responsibility.\n\nReputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of the Allianz share price, the value of the in-force business, or the value of the future business caused by a decline in our reputation in internal or external stakeholders' judgement.\n\nAll affected Allianz SE functions cooperate in identifying reputational risk. Group Communications and Reputation 1 assesses reputational risk for Allianz SE based on a group-wide methodology, covering all  areas of reputational risk including Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks.\n\nThe identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of the annual Top Risk Assessment process. As part of this process, senior management approves the risk management strategy for the most significant risks facing the company, including those with a potentially severe  reputational impact. In addition, significant ESG and other reputational risks identified in the course of business (direct reputational risk) are managed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nClimate  change  has  the  potential  to  materially  affect  the  global economy and the business of Allianz Group and Allianz SE, especially in the long run. Risks arising from climate change can be seen already today and their relevance will increase over the mid- and long-term. These can for instance be acute and chronic physical risks such as warming temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying  heatwaves and droughts, or a change in vector-borne diseases, with impacts on property or health. The risks also result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. These include changes in climate policy, technology, or market sentiment, and impact thereof on  the market value of financial assets as well as impact resulting from climate change litigation.\n\nClimate change also creates opportunities, be it in connection with financing a low-carbon and climate-resilient future (e.g., by investing  in  renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric vehicle infrastructure), or by providing insurance solutions to protect against physical climate impacts and to support low-carbon business models.\n\nClimate change impacts the reinsurance business of Allianz SE in two key ways:\n\n- -First, through the provided cover, e.g., for health impacts, property damage, and other losses and\n- -Second, through changes in market sectors and business models\n\nFurthermore, Allianz Group and Allianz SE are affected as large-scale institutional investors. Allianz has significant stakes in various economies, companies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be affected by the physical impact of climate change and by the transition to a low-carbon economy. This can directly influence the ability of assets to generate long-term value.\n\nWe address immediate risks from climate change factors following the management approach for the primary underlying risks, e.g., building on Allianz's long-term expertise in the modeling of extreme weather events or analyzing emission profiles of our proprietary investments. On a forward-looking basis, we consider risks from climate change factors under emerging risks, where we closely monitor the development of the risk landscape supported by selective analyses on our portfolios.",

        "page_content": "## Internal risk capital framework\n\nWe define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us against unexpected, extreme economic losses. It forms the basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization.  We calculate Allianz SE's internal risk capital on a quarterly basis in total as well as for all contributing business units. During periods of financial market turbulence, we also project the risk capital requirements for one reporting period more frequently.\n\n## GENERAL APPROACH\n\nWe utilize an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules for the management of our risk profile and solvency position.\n\n## INTERNAL MODEL\n\nOur internal risk capital model is based on a Value at Risk (VaR) approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss in portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe ('holding period', set at one year) and probability of occurrence ('confidence level',  set at 99.5 %). We simulate risk events from all risk categories modeled ('sources of risk') and calculate the portfolio value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-mitigating measures like retrocession or derivatives, under each scenario.\n\nThe required risk capital is defined as the difference between the current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level. As we simultaneously consider the impact of a negative or positive event on all covered businesses, diversification effects across products and regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both separately and in aggregate. We  also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios, representing historical events, reverse stress tests and adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc stress tests to reflect current political and financial developments and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely.\n\n## COVERAGE OF THE RISK CAPITAL CALCULATIONS\n\nAllianz SE's  internal  risk  capital  model  to  calculate  the  Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) covers the activities of Allianz SE as the holding company for Allianz Group as well as its activities as a reinsurer.\n\nWhereas the model treats most subsidiaries as participations, it applies a look-through rule for 35 subsidiaries and investment funds, which are ancillary to Allianz SE's operations (mainly by holding assets), and reflects their risks on a granular level either completely or partially.\n\nThe risk capital model covers all relevant assets (including fixedincome instruments, equities, real estate, and derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt and other liabilities such as guarantees).\n\nTherefore, Allianz SE's risk capital framework covers all material and quantifiable risks. Risks specifically not covered by our internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS\n\n## RISK FREE RATE AND VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENT\n\nWhen calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities  (excluding pensions obligations), the assumptions regarding the underlying riskfree yield curve are crucial in determining and discounting future cash flows. For extrapolation of the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor, we apply the methodology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in its technical documentation (EIOPA BoS-20/109). 1\n\nIn addition, we partially adjust the risk-free yield curves of the reinsurance portfolio using a volatility adjustment (VA) for most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined by EIOPA and approved by BaFin. This is done to better reflect the underlying economics of our business. The advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of forced selling of debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.\n\nThe approach of the Allianz Group to model the volatility adjustment with the help of a dynamic component differs methodologically from replicating the EIOPA VA methodology. To account for deviations with respect to the EIOPA VA methodology, the Allianz Group applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the dynamic volatility adjustment.\n\n## DIVERSIFICATION AND CORRELATION ASSUMPTIONS\n\nOur internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and correlation effects when aggregating results for Allianz SE. The resulting diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are not likely to materialize at the same time.\n\nDiversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification factors include regions (for example,  windstorm in Australia versus windstorm in Germany), risk categories (for example, market risk versus  underwriting risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (for example, equity risk versus interest rate risk). Ultimately, diversification is driven by the specific features of the investments or reinsurance transactions in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an operational risk event at the Allianz SE branch in Singapore can be considered to be highly independent of a change in the credit spread for a French government bond held in Allianz SE's reinsurance investment portfolio in Munich.\n\nWhere possible, the Allianz Group derives correlation parameters for each pair of market risks through statistical analysis of historical market data, considering observations over more than a decade. In case historical data or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, correlations are set by the Allianz Group Correlation Setting Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and controlled process. In general, when using expert judgment, we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, the Allianz Group uses an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.",

        "page_content": "## ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\nOur internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability inflation,  mortality,  morbidity,  longevity,  policyholder  behavior, expenses, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible, leverage expertise of other Allianz Group companies in the scope of the internal model, and also consider recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions  is  based  on  generally  accepted  actuarial  methods. Within  our  internal  risk  capital  and  financial  reporting  framework, comprehensive processes and controls exist for ensuring the reliability of these assumptions.\n\n## MODEL LIMITATIONS\n\nAs the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold at the Allianz SE level in the course of one year.\n\nWe use model and scenario parameters derived from historical data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If  future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for example in an unprecedented crisis, our VaR approach might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis with stress testing.\n\nFurthermore,  we  validate  the  model  and  parameters  through sensitivity  analyses,  independent internal peer reviews, and - where appropriate - independent external reviews, focusing on methods for selecting parameters and control processes. Overall, we believe that our validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nSince the internal model takes into account the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some assets and liabilities it may be difficult, if not impossible - notably in distressed financial markets  -  to  either  obtain  a  current  market  price  or  to  apply  a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values additionally depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are appropriately assessed.\n\nWhile the aggregate risk capital is exactly modeled, the whole account  stop loss construction 1 leads to the use of approximations when reporting contributory risk capital figures for the sub-categories of underwriting risk as the individual contributions have to be approximated based on the underlying distributions.\n\n## MODEL CHANGES IN 2020\n\nIn 2020, our internal model has been further enhanced based on regulatory  developments,  model  validation  results,  and  feedback received by Allianz Group in the course of consultations with the regulator.\n\nOverall, the model changes implemented in 2020 decreased the Solvency II risk capital of Allianz SE by \u20ac 420 mn.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, the risk figures for 2019 after model changes will form the basis for the analysis of the changes in our risk profile in 2020.\n\nAllianz SE: Impact of model changes/uni003B Allocated risk according to the risk profile \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2019/uni00B9   | 2019/uni00B2   |\n|---------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Market risk         | 36,998         | 37,524         |\n| Credit risk         | 566            | 559            |\n| Underwriting risk   | 3,474          | 3,407          |\n| Business risk       | 48             | 48             |\n| Operational risk    | 660            | 657            |\n| Diversification     | (3,798)        | (3,827)        |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 37,948         | 38,368         |\n\n- 1\\_2019 risk profile figures recalculated based on model changes in 2020.\n- 2\\_2019 risk profile figures as reported previously.\n\nThe changes to our internal model affected the risk categories and diversification as follows:\n\n## MARKET, CREDIT AND UNDERWRITING RISK\n\nThe implementation of several model changes, together with updates of the central correlation matrix and real world scenarios (including new random numbers) decreased market risk by \u20ac 526 mn, also led to an increase in credit risk by \u20ac 7 mn, and caused an increase in underwriting risk by \u20ac 67 mn.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nOperational risk increased by \u20ac 3 mn, driven by the updates of the central correlation matrix and the real world scenarios.\n\n## DIVERSIFICATION\n\nThe update of the correlation matrix, together with the indirect impact of various other model changes, reduced the risk capital relief from the diversification between risk categories by \u20ac 29 mn.\n\n## Risk profile and management assessment\n\n## RISK PROFILE AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe quantitative risk profile of Allianz SE is primarily dominated by market risk that results from its non-traded insurance participations when measured in a manner consistent with the treatment of participations under Solvency II (e.g., without looking through to the underlying risks behind the participations). In order to provide greater transparency, the Group risk figures as reflected in the Allianz Group Annual Report can be interpreted as a 'look-through' view at the consolidated risk profile represented by all of the Group's participations as well as those risks unique to Allianz SE. The second largest risk for Allianz SE from an internal model perspective is the underwriting risk arising from its reinsurance business and from internal pension obligations.",

        "page_content": "From a broad perspective, the overall risk profile of Allianz SE has remained and is expected to remain stable. 'Stable'  in this context means a relatively very high exposure to market risk, in particular from participations equity generated by our holding of Allianz Group subsidiaries, a high exposure to underwriting risk and moderate exposures  to operational risk and credit risk (i.e., measured  as a share  of the Allianz SE's Solvency II risk capital). Please refer to the section 'Solvency II regulatory capitalization' for further details.\n\nTo support the development of a risk appetite and a risk management framework for these core risks, Allianz SE has elaborated the following risk management philosophy:\n\n- -Financial  risks: Allianz SE's  objective  is  to  support  the  Group strategy while ensuring that financial risk taking is in line with its risk bearing capacity. To manage financial risk effectively, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, monitor and control the risks inherent especially in the investment portfolios, financing transactions, the reinsurance portfolio and the internal pension obligations.\n- -Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are accepted when acting  as a reinsurer for  predominantly Group-internal business. Quality control mechanisms are applied to ensure adherence to Allianz Group's underwriting standards and to monitor the quality of the portfolio, the underwriting and retrocession processes. These processes must support sustainable and profitable business decisions, and need to be aligned with the risk appetite of Allianz SE and the Group as well as avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and accumulations. The full economic consequences of a pandemic event such as COVID-19 are uninsurable. The required capital for effective protection against such an accumulation of risks  would require premium rates that are unattractive for the customers,  if not unaffordable. In addition, a pandemic affects multiple  lines  of  business  such  as  business  interruption,  travel, event cancellations, but also liability lines as well as increases in medical costs and mortality. On top the impact on capital markets needs consideration.\n- -Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to Allianz SE as holding company and reinsurer for Allianz Group, and need to be carefully managed via continuous improvements in risk identification,  risk  assessment  and  control  environments.  This  occurs through elements of the risk management framework such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), Integrated Risk and Control  System (IRCS), Reputational Risk Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\n## POTENTIAL RISKS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IN OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nFinancial markets are characterized by historically low interest rates and low risk premiums, prompting some investors to look for higheryielding - and potentially higher-risk  -  investments. In addition to sustained low interest rates, the challenges of implementing longterm structural reforms in key Eurozone countries, the uncertainty about future monetary and fiscal policies, rising populism, amplified geopolitical  tensions  and  economic  nationalism  amid  the  pandemic, which weigh on global trade with the potential of prompting long-term structural shifts in global supply chains, may lead to\n\nincreasing market volatility. The increasing reliance on digital technologies, which has been greatly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic - to ensure business continuity and enhance efficiency and competitiveness  -  increases the risk of technology obsolescence, cyber-attacks, data breaches and system failures. There is also the risk of  noncompliance  with  increasing  regulation  covering  IT  related business processes.\n\nThe uncertainty around the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant risk. The approval, production, distribution, and correct administration of the vaccines are critical in alleviating the social, economic, and financial repercussions of the pandemic. The steps are subject to a number of challenges such as the efficacy of the vaccines, high-quality mass production, potential long-term side effects and the willingness of a majority of the population to get vaccinated.  Full  economic  recovery  is  not  expected  to  occur  until  the health concerns are forcefully and credibly addressed, i.e., the herd immunity is achieved. Global vaccination is expected to be eventually successful/uni003B however, the timing and progress appear uncertain. Residual risks will remain such as further virus mutations, emerging side effects, length of the immunity, or refusal to take vaccines by the  majority of the population as most authorities do not intend to make vaccination compulsory. The extended containment (lockdown) measures risk delaying economic recovery, with significant credit implications in some industries. The pace and timing of recovery, the overall economic cost, and credit implications will depend on an effective transition to post-COVID  policies, as less supportive  fiscal packages could hurt employment and the solvency of small or more exposed businesses.\n\nAnother strain is the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement negotiated between them enters into force in 2021.\n\nTherefore, we continue to closely monitor political and financial developments as well as the global trade situation to manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks.\n\n## REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\n\nOur approved internal model has been applied since the beginning of the year 2016, when Solvency II became effective.\n\nIn addition, future Solvency II capital requirements might change depending  on  the  outcome  of  the  2020  review  of  the  Solvency II framework  by EIOPA. Concrete effects of the Solvency II review for Allianz SE, however, can only be assessed after final results  are available, which is not expected before end of 2022.\n\n## MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT\n\nAllianz SE's management feels comfortable with Allianz SE's overall risk profile and is confident that the effectiveness of its risk management framework meets both the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and the day-to-day business needs. This confidence is based on several factors:\n\n- -Due to its effective capital management, Allianz SE is well capitalized. We have met our internal and regulatory solvency targets as of 31 December 2020.\n- -As a result of COVID-19 pandemic, Allianz SE and Allianz Group experienced the following:",

        "page_content": "- -Losses in the Property-Casualty  (re-)insurance business segment resulted from business interruption coverage and accumulations from the entertainment sector.\n- -There is a potentially higher market risk, mainly due to the volatility of equity prices and interest rates. Allianz SE has supported Allianz Group's risk mitigating measures, for example via implementing an overlay credit default swap (CDS) protection.\n- -Elevated reputational risk, as lawsuits with respect to business interruption policies of Allianz Group companies could affect Allianz SE's and Allianz Group's purpose statement depending on media coverage and public perception. In addition increased regulatory pressure can be observed regarding dividend payments of insurance companies and insurance holdings.\n- -Business continuity and employer liability remain a focus area. The implementation of a new work model is key to addressing employer liability risks resulting from the accelerated trend by COVID-19 to work from home. This is accompanied with respective changes in IT risk management.\n- -Allianz SE is well positioned to deal with potentially adverse future events such as from the COVID-19 pandemic - due to our strong internal limit framework, stress testing, internal model, and risk management practices.\n- -Allianz SE  has a conservative investment profile and disciplined business practices in the reinsurance business, leading to sustainable operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.\n\nBased on the information available to us at the moment of report completion, including the known impacts of COVID-19, we expect Allianz SE to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement. We also expect to maintain a robust liquidity buffer in case of short term market volatility. However, we are carefully monitoring the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and managing our investment portfolio to ensure that Allianz SE has sufficient resources to meet its solvency capital and liquidity needs.\n\n## SOLVENCY II REGULATORY CAPITALIZATION\n\nAllianz SE's  own funds and capital requirements are based on the market value balance sheet approach consistent with the economic principles of Solvency II. 1 Our regulatory capitalization is shown in the following table:\n\n## Allianz SE: Solvency II regulatory capitalization\n\n| as of 31 December    |      |   2020/uni00B9 |   2019/uni00B2 |\n|----------------------|------|----------------|----------------|\n| Own funds            | \u20ac bn |             95 |           92.9 |\n| Capital requirement  | \u20ac bn |             37 |           38.4 |\n| Capitalization ratio | %    |            257 |          242   |\n\n- 2\\_2019 risk profile figures as reported previously.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the Solvency II capitalization of Allianz SE is at  257 %.  The  increase  by  15 percentage  points  in  year  2020  was caused by a \u20ac 1.4 bn decrease in risk capital requirements, combined with a \u20ac 2.1 bn increase in eligible own funds.\n\nThe  Allianz Group  companies  Allianz  Lebensversicherungs-AG and  Allianz  Private  Krankenversicherungs-AG  have  been  granted approval for the application of transitionals on technical provisions. The resulting change in participation values impacts Allianz SE's own funds and capital requirements. Including the application of transitional measures for technical provisions at these Allianz Group companies,  Allianz SE's  own  funds  and  capital  requirement  amounted  to \u20ac 108.6 bn and \u20ac 41.5 bn, leading to a Solvency II ratio of 262 %. However, the general capital steering for both Allianz Group and Allianz SE continues to focus on the previous approach, i.e., excluding the application  of  transitional  measures  for  technical  provisions  at Allianz Group companies. Consequently, the figures in all subsequent sections exclude transitional measures applied at Allianz Group companies unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Quantifiable risks and opportunities by risk category\n\nThis Risk and Opportunity Report outlines Allianz SE's risk figures, reflecting  its  risk  profile  based  on  pre-diversified  risk  figures  and Allianz SE diversification effects.\n\nWe measure and steer risk based on an approved internal model, which measures the potential adverse developments of Own Funds. The results provide an overview of how our risk profile is distributed over different risk categories,  and determine the regulatory capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II.\n\nThe pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effects within each modeled risk category (i.e., within market, credit, underwriting, business, and operational risk) but do not include the diversification effects across risk categories. The Allianz SE diversified risk also captures the diversification effects across all risk categories.\n\nThe Allianz SE diversified risk is broken down as follows:\n\n## Allianz SE: Allocated risk according to the risk profile\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|\n| Market risk         | 35,876  | 36,998  |\n| Credit risk         | 636     | 566     |\n| Underwriting risk   | 3,709   | 3,474   |\n| Business risk       | 42      | 48      |\n| Operational risk    | 632     | 660     |\n| Diversification     | (3,893) | (3,798) |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 37,003  | 37,948  |\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, Allianz SE's diversified risk capital amounted to \u20ac 37.0 bn (2019: \u20ac 37.9 bn).

All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\nThe following table presents the market risk of Allianz SE related to the source of risk:\n\nAllianz SE: Risk profile - Market risk by source of risk pre-diversified, \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest rate       | 30     | 23     |\n| Inflation           | (333)  | (329)  |\n| Credit spread       | 247    | 344    |\n| Equity              | 35,668 | 37,145 |\n| Real estate         | 123    | 200    |\n| Currency            | 141    | (385)  |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 35,876 | 36,998 |\n\nFor  Allianz SE,  the  pre-diversified  market  risk  as  of  year-end  2020 shows a decrease of \u20ac 1,122 mn driven by a reduction in equity risk.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nIn 2020, the interest rate risk of Allianz SE increased by \u20ac 7 mn, mainly caused by diversification effects.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, Allianz SE's interest-rate-sensitive assets amounting to a market value of \u20ac 48.1 bn would have gained \u20ac 2.5 bn or lost \u20ac 2.2 bn in value, in the event of interest rates changing by -100 and +100 basis points, respectively.\n\n## INFLATION RISK\n\nThe \u20ac 4 mn increase in the market risk relief that results from inflation risk in 2020 mainly results from the impact of lower interest rates.\n\n## EQUITY RISK\n\nIn 2020, Allianz SE's equity risk decreased by \u20ac 1,477 mn, reflecting, among  other  things,  a  change  in  the  value  of  participations  in Allianz Group companies.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, those of our investment assets that are sensitive  to  changing  equity  markets  would  have  lost  \u20ac 208 mn  in value, assuming equity markets declined by 30 %.\n\n## CREDIT SPREAD RISK\n\nAllianz SE's credit spread risk is \u20ac 97 mn lower than in 2019, mainly reflecting the implementation of an overlay credit default swap (CDS) protection.\n\n## REAL ESTATE RISK\n\nThe \u20ac 77 mn decrease in 2020 primarily reflects diversification effects.\n\n## CURRENCY RISK\n\nAllianz SE's \u20ac 141 mn currency risk at year-end 2020 results from net open positions in several currencies, dominated by the U.S. Dollar. The \u20ac 526 mn increase in the contribution to market risk is mainly caused by diversification effects.\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\nAllianz SE's credit risk slightly increased by \u20ac 70 mn in 2020, mainly reflecting additional bond investments.\n\n## UNDERWRITING RISK\n\nThe following table presents the pre-diversified risk calculated for underwriting risks stemming from our reinsurance business and internal pensions: 1\n\nAllianz SE: Risk Profile - Underwriting risk by source of risk pre-diversified, \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December                  | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Premium natural catastrophe        | 332    | 371    |\n| Premium non-catastrophe and terror | 1,544  | 1,496  |\n| Reserve                            | 1,647  | 1,465  |\n| Biometric                          | 186    | 143    |\n| Total Allianz SE                   | 3,709  | 3,474  |\n\nFor Allianz SE, the pre-diversified underwriting risk showed an increase of \u20ac 235 mn, driven by an increase in reserve risk.\n\n## PROPERTY-CASUALTY\n\n## Premium risk\n\nIn 2020, Allianz SE's natural catastrophe risk decreased by \u20ac 39 mn.\n\nThe top five scenarios contributing to Allianz SE's natural catastrophe  risk as of 31 December 2020 were a windstorm in Europe, a flood in Germany, a tropical cyclone in Australia, an earthquake in Turk ey, and an earthquake in Australia.\n\nAllianz SE's non-catastrophe and terror premium risk increased by \u20ac 48 mn in 2020.\n\n## Reserve risk\n\nAmong others, the \u20ac 182 mn increase in Allianz SE's reserve risk in 2020 reflects an increase in reserves from group-internal quota shares.\n\n## LIFE/HEALTH\n\nIn 2020, Allianz SE's biometric risk is \u20ac 43 mn higher than in 2019. The main driver is an increase in longevity risk from internal pension obligations reflecting lower interest rates.",

        "page_content": "## INTEGRATED RISK AND CONTROL SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to \u00a7 289 (4) of the HGB. In line with both our prudent approach to risk governance and compliance with regulatory requirements, we have created a framework and processes to identify and mitigate the risk of material errors in our financial statements (this also includes market value balance sheet and risk capital controls). Allianz SE's Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) is regularly reviewed and updated. It differentiates  between  three  areas:  Financial  Reporting,  Compliance  and other operational risks (including IT risks). The IT controls are based on COBIT 5 and include, for example, controls for access rights management, and for IT project and change management. The IRCS also covers  external service providers. Additionally, our Entity Level Control Assessment (ELCA) framework contains controls to monitor the effectiveness of the system of governance.\n\n## Accounting Processes\n\nThe accounting processes we use to produce financial statements are based on a group-wide IT solution and local general ledger. Access rights to accounting systems are managed according to strict authorization procedures.\n\nInternal controls are embedded in the accounting processes to safeguard the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the information provided in our financial statements.\n\n## Integrated internal Risk and Control System Approach\n\nOur approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n- -We use a centrally developed risk catalogue that is linked to individual accounts. This risk catalogue is reviewed on a yearly basis and is the starting point for the definition of the Group's as well as of Allianz SE's scope of financial reporting risks. The methodology is described in the IRCS-Guideline. During the scoping process, both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are considered simultaneously. In addition to the quantitative calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria.\n- -Based on the centrally provided risk catalogue, we identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.\n- -Preventive and detective key controls to address financial reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial misstatements. If a potential risk materializes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstatement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting processes on IT systems, we have also implemented IT controls.\n- -Last but not least, we ensure that controls are appropriately designed and effectively executed to mitigate risk. We conduct an annual assessment of our control system to maintain and continuously enhance its effectiveness. Internal audit ensures that the overall quality of our control system is subject to regular control testing, to assure reasonable design and operating effectiveness.",

According to \u00a7 317 (2) sentence 6 of the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB'), the audit of the disclosures is limited to whether the relevant disclosures have been made.\n\n## Corporate Constitution of the European Company (SE)\n\nAs a European Company, Allianz SE is subject to special European SE regulations and the German SE Implementation Act ('SE-Ausf\u00fchrungsgesetz') in addition to the German SE Employee Involvement Act ('SE-Beteiligungsgesetz'). Notwithstanding, the main features of a German stock corporation - in particular the two-tier board system (Board of Management and Supervisory Board) and the principle of equal employee representation on the Supervisory Board - have been maintained by Allianz SE. The Corporate Constitution of Allianz SE is laid down in its Statutes. The current version of the Statutes is available on our website at www.allianz.com/statutes .\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nThe regulatory requirements for corporate governance (system of governance) applicable for insurance companies, insurance groups, and financial conglomerates apply. Specifically, they include the establishment  and further design of significant control functions (independent  risk control function, actuarial function, compliance function, and internal audit) as well as general principles for a sound business organization. These regulatory requirements are applicable throughout the Group in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The implementation of the regulatory requirements is supported by written guidelines issued by the Board of Management of  Allianz SE.  Furthermore, Solvency II requires the publication of qualitative  and quantitative information including a market value balance sheet. Details on the implementation of the regulatory requirements  for corporate governance by Allianz SE and by the Allianz Group can be found in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report of Allianz SE and of the Allianz Group, which are published on our website at www.allianz.com/sfcr .\n\n## Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nGood corporate governance is essential for sustainable business performance. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of  Allianz SE therefore attach great importance to complying with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (hereinafter  referred to as the 'Code').  On  10 December 2020, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued the following Declaration of Conformity of Allianz SE with the Code:\n\nDeclaration of Conformity in accordance with \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n\nDeclaration of Conformity by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission in accordance with \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nAllianz SE currently complies with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (Code) in the version of December 16, 2019 and will comply with them in the future. Since the last Declaration of Conformity as of December 13, 2019, Allianz SE has complied with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of February 7, 2017.\n\nMunich, December 10, 2020 Allianz SE\n\nFor the Management Board: Signed Oliver B\u00e4te\n\nSigned Renate Wagner\n\nFor the Supervisory Board: Signed Michael Diekmann\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE  follows all the suggestions of the Code in its 16 December 2019 version.\n\nThe  Declaration  of  Conformity  and  further  information  on corporate  governance at Allianz  can be found on our website at www.allianz.com/corporate-governance .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Function of the Board of Management and the composition and functions of committees\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has ten members. Its members may not, in general, be older than 62 years of age.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for setting business objectives and the strategic direction, for coordinating and supervising the operating entities, and for implementing and overseeing an efficient risk management system. The Board of Management also prepares the annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements, the market value balance sheet, and the interim report.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are jointly responsible for management and for complying with legal requirements.

There are divisional responsibilities for business segments as well as functional responsibilities. The latter include the Finance, Risk Management and  Controlling Functions, Investments, Operations and IT, Human Resources,  Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, or Mergers & Acquisitions. Business division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or Global Lines. Rules of procedure specify in more detail the structure and departmental responsibilities of the Board of Management.\n\nBoard of Management meetings are led by the Chairman. Each member of the Board may request a meeting, providing notification of the proposed subject. The Board makes decisions by a simple majority of participating members.

The list of candidates includes internal and external candidates who generally meet the requirements for a mandate in the Board of Management. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Management, the Personnel Committee,  after a thorough examination, recommends a suitable candidate to the Supervisory Board plenary session and reports on the selection process and, if necessary, alternative candidates. Prior to an appointment to the Board of Management, all members of the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to meet the candidate in person.\n\nCurrently there are three women on the Management Board representing  a  share  of  30 %.  Five  members  of  the  Management Board have international backgrounds. There is an adequate degree of variety as regards educational and professional backgrounds. The Board of Management of Allianz SE is thus composed in accordance with the diversity concept.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe Allianz Group has an effective internal risk and control system for  verifying and monitoring its operating activities and business processes, in particular financial reporting, as well as compliance with regulatory requirements. The requirements placed on the internal control system are essential not only for the resilience and franchise value of the company, but also to maintain the confidence of the capital market, our customers, and the public. An assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the System of Governance is conducted regularly in the course of the review of the business organization. For further information on our risk  organization and risk principles, please refer to the section 'Risk governance system' in the Risk and Opportunity Report. For further information on our Integrated Risk and Control System for Financial Reporting, please refer to the respective chapter.\n\nIn addition, the quality of our internal control system is assessed by the Allianz Group's Internal Audit function. This function conducts independent, objective assurance activities, analyzing the structure and efficiency of the internal control system as a whole. In addition, it also examines the potential for additional value and improvement of our organization's operations. Fully compliant with all international auditing principles and standards, Internal Audit contributes to the evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of the risk management, control, and governance processes. Therefore, internal audit activities are geared towards helping the company to mitigate risks, and further assist in strengthening its governance processes and structures.\n\n## COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nIntegrity is at the core of our compliance programs and the basis for the trust of our customers, shareholders, business partners, and employees. The compliance function fosters a corporate culture of individual and collective responsibility for ethical conduct and adherence to the rules by:\n\n- -Advising the Board of Management, managers, and employees on business conduct that is lawful and ethical/uni003B\n- -Identifying and assessing material compliance risks and overseeing the implementation of adequate and effective internal controls to mitigate them/uni003B\n- -Providing a speak-up facility that employees and third parties can use to confidentially report possible illegal or inappropriate behavior/uni003B\n- -Communicating transparently and trustfully with supervisory authorities.\n\nThe global compliance programs coordinated by Allianz SE's central Group Compliance function support our employees, managers, and executive board members to act responsibly and with integrity in all situations.\n\nMoreover,  Allianz SE's central Group Compliance function is responsible - in close cooperation with local compliance functions for ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring of the compliance programs within the Allianz Group as well as for investigating potential compliance infringements. Furthermore, as a key function, the compliance function carries out the advisory, risk identification and assessment, monitoring, and early warning tasks required under the Solvency II regime.\n\n## CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nOur  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  internal  Compliance  policies  and guidelines derived from it provide all employees, managers, and executive  board members with clear and practical guidance, enabling them to act in line with the values of the Allianz Group. The rules of conduct established by the Code of Conduct are binding for all employees worldwide and build the basis for our compliance programs. We did not identify any material violations of the Code of Conduct in 2020. The Code of Conduct is available on our website at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.allianz.com/compliance .\n\n## SPEAK UP\n\nA major component of the Allianz Group's compliance management system is a speak-up facility that allows employees and third parties to  notify the relevant compliance department confidentially about potential  illegal  or  inappropriate  conduct.  No  employee  voicing concerns about irregularities in good faith needs to fear retribution, even if the concerns later turn out to be unfounded. Third parties can contact the compliance department via an electronic mailbox on our website www.allianz.com/complaint-system .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS\n\nAllianz SE's central Group Compliance function has set up internal guidelines for the following identified compliance risk areas: financial  crime,  market  integrity,  customer  protection,  and compliance with legal requirements. For further information on the compliance risk areas, please refer to the Combined Separate Non-Financial  Report  for  Allianz Group  and  Allianz SE  of  the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2020 and the Sustainability Report on our website at www.allianz.com/sustainability .\n\n## COMPLIANCE TRAINING\n\nIn order to convey the principles of the Code of Conduct and the compliance programs based on these principles, Allianz has implemented",

These provide practical guidance that enables employees to make their own decisions based on internal and external requirements as well as ethical principles. Training programs comprise in-person and e-learning trainings and are delivered in several languages.\n\nTraining courses to prevent corruption and money laundering are mandatory for all Allianz employees worldwide. The same is true for the antitrust training to exposed employees. Further trainings exist for the other compliance programs.\n\n## Function of the Supervisory Board and the composition and functions of committees\n\nThe  German  Co-Determination  Act  ('Mitbestimmungsgesetz')  does not apply to Allianz SE because it has the legal form of a European Company (SE). Instead, the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is determined by general European SE regulations. These regulations are implemented in the Statutes and via the SE Agreement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board comprises twelve members, including six shareholder representatives appointed by the AGM. The six employee representatives are appointed by the SE works council. The specific procedure for their appointment is laid down in the SE Agreement. This agreement stipulates that the six employee representatives must be allocated in proportion to the number of Allianz employees in the different countries. The Supervisory Board currently in office includes four employee representatives from Germany and one each from France and the United Kingdom. According to \u00a7 17 (2) of the German SE  Implementation  Act  ('SE-Ausf\u00fchrungsgesetz'),  the  Supervisory Board of Allianz SE shall be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. It is to be proposed to the AGM on 5 May 2021 that the regular term of appointment for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE be shortened to four years in the future.\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management on managing the business. It is also responsible for appointing the members of the Board of Management, determining their overall remuneration, succession planning for the Board of Management, and reviewing Allianz SE's and the Allianz Group's annual financial statements. The Supervisory Board's activities in the 2020 financial year, including an individualized disclosure of the meeting participation, are described in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board makes all decisions based on a simple majority.  The  special  requirements  for  appointing  members  to  the Board of Management, as stipulated in the German Co-Determination Act, and the requirement to have a Conciliation Committee do not apply to an SE. In the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, who at Allianz SE must be a  shareholder representative. If the Chairman is not present in the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the vice chairperson from the shareholder side. A second vice chairperson is elected at the employee representatives' proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities.  The review is carried out either on the basis of a selfevaluation using a questionnaire or by consulting an external consultant.  The entire Supervisory Board discusses recommendations for improvements and adopts appropriate measures on the basis of  recommendations from the Standing Committee. In addition, the fitness and propriety of the individual members of the Supervisory\n\nBoard are reviewed as part of an annual self-evaluation required by supervisory law, and a development plan for the Supervisory Board is drawn up on this basis.\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nPart of the Supervisory Board's work is carried out by its committees.  The Supervisory Board receives regular reports on the activities  of its committees. The composition of committees and the  tasks  assigned  to  them  are  regulated  by  the  Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure, which can be found on our website at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## www.allianz.com/supervisory-board\n\n.\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n| Supervisory Board committees                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| STANDING COMMITTEE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -

        "page_content": "## OBJECTIVES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD REGARDING ITS COMPOSITION/uni003B DIVERSITY CONCEPT\n\nThe objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board in the version  of  June 2020, as specified to implement legal requirements and a recommendation by the Code, are set out below. In addition to the skills profile for the overall Supervisory Board, the diversity concept\n\n## Objectives of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board regarding its composition\n\n'The aim of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board is to have members who are equipped with the necessary skills and competence to properly supervise and advise Allianz SE's management. Supervisory Board candidates should possess the professional expertise and experience, integrity, motivation and commitment, independence, and personality required to successfully carry out the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board member in a financial services institution with international operations.\n\nThese objectives take into account the regulatory requirements for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the relevant recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('GCGC'). In addition to the requirements for each individual member, a profile of skills and expertise ('Kompetenzprofil') as well as a diversity concept are provided for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\n## I. Requirements relating to the individual members of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Propriety\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must be proper as defined by the regulatory provisions. A person is assumed to be proper as long as no facts are to be known which may cause impropriety. Therefore, no personal circumstances shall exist which - according to general experience - lead to the assumption that the diligent and orderly exercise of the mandate may be affected (in particular, administrative offenses or violation of criminal law, esp. in connection with commercial activity).\n\n## 2. Fitness\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must have the expertise and experience necessary for a diligent and autonomous exercise of the Allianz SE Supervisory Board mandate, in particular for exercising control of and giving advice to the Board of Management as well as for the active support of the development of the company. This comprises in particular:\n\n- -  adequate expertise in all business areas/uni003B\n- -  adequate expertise in the insurance and finance sector or comparable relevant experience and expertise in other sectors/uni003B\n- -  adequate expertise in the regulatory provisions material for Allianz SE (supervisory law,\n- including Solvency II regulation, corporate and capital markets law, corporate governance)/uni003B\n- -ability to assess the business risks/uni003B\n- -  knowledge of accounting and risk management basics.\n\n## 3. Independence\n\nThe GCGC defines a person as independent who, in particular, does not have any business or personal relations with Allianz SE or its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder, or an enterprise associated with the latter, which may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest.\n\nTo further specify the definition of independence, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE states the following:\n\n- -  former members of the Allianz SE Board of Management shall not be deemed independent during the mandatory corporate law cooling-off period.\n- -  members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in office for more than 12 years shall not be deemed independent.\n- -  regarding employee representatives, the mere fact of employee representation and the existence of a working relationship with the company shall not in itself affect the independence of the employee representatives.\n\nApplying such definition, at least eight members of the Supervisory Board shall be independent. In case shareholder representatives and employee representatives are viewed separately, at least four of each should be independent.\n\nIt has to be considered that the possible emergence of conflicts of interests in individual cases cannot generally be excluded. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and will be resolved by appropriate measures.\n\n## 4. Time of availability\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must ensure that they have sufficient time to dedicate to the proper fulfilment of the mandate of this Supervisory Board position.\n\nIn addition to the mandatory mandate limitations and the GCGC recommendation for active Management Board members of listed companies (max. two mandates), the common capital markets requirements shall be considered.\n\nWith respect to the Allianz SE mandate, the members shall ensure that\n\n- -  they can attend at least four, usually six ordinary Supervisory Board meetings per year, each of which requires adequate preparation/uni003B\n- -  they have sufficient time for the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements/uni003B\n\nThe Supervisory Board pursues these objectives, and thus also the diversity concept, when nominating candidates for shareholder representatives. As employee representatives are appointed according to different national provisions, there is only limited potential influence to the selection of employee representatives. The Supervisory Board of\n\nAllianz SE is currently composed in accordance with these objectives, including the diversity concept. According to the assessment by the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives, i.e., Ms. Boissard, Ms. Bosse  as  well  as  Mr. Diekmann,  Dr. Eichiner,  Mr. Hainer  and Mr. Snabe, are independent within the meaning of the objectives\n\nin accordance with the legislation on the implementation of the European guideline as regards the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information (CSR Directive) is also included. The objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board can be found on our website\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.allianz.com/supervisory-board\n\n.\n\nEmployee representation within Allianz SE, according to the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE, contributes to the diversity of work experience and cultural background. Pursuant to the provisions of the German SE Participation Act (SEBG), the number of women and men appointed as German employee representatives should be proportional to the number of women and men working in the German companies. However, the Supervisory Board does not have the right to select the employee representatives.\n\nThe following requirements and objectives apply to the composition of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board:\n\n- -  they can attend the General Meeting/uni003B\n- -  depending on possible membership in one or more of the current six Supervisory Board special committees, this involves extra time planning to participate in these Committee meetings and do the necessary preparation for these meetings/uni003B this applies in particular for the Audit and risk Committees/uni003B\n- -  they can attend extraordinary meetings of the Supervisory Board or of a special committee to deal with special matters as and when required.\n\n## 5. Retirement age\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board shall, as a rule, not be older than 70 years of age.\n\n## 6. Term of membership\n\nThe continuous period of membership for any member of the Supervisory Board should, as a rule, not exceed 12 years.\n\n## 7. Former Allianz SE Management Board members\n\nFormer Allianz SE Management Board members are subject to the mandatory corporate law coolingoff period of two years.\n\nAccording to regulatory provisions, no more than two former Allianz SE Management Board members shall be members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## II. Requirements for the entire Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Profile of skills and expertise for the entire Supervisory Board\n\nIn addition to the expertise-related requirements for the individual members, the following shall apply with respect to the expertise and experience of the entire Supervisory Board:\n\n- -  familiarity of members in their entirety with the insurance and financial services sector/uni003B\n- -  adequate expertise of the entire board with respect to investment management, insurance actuarial practice, accounting, technology and employee engagement/uni003B\n- -  at least one member with considerable experience in the fields of insurance and financial services/uni003B\n- -  at least one member with comprehensive expertise in the fields of accounting or auditing/uni003B\n- -  at least one member with comprehensive expertise in the field of digital transformation/uni003B\n- -  specialist expertise or experience in other economic sectors/uni003B\n- -  managerial or operational experience.\n\n## 2. Diversity concept\n\nTo promote an integrative cooperation among the Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board strives for an adequate diversity with respect to gender, internationality, different occupational backgrounds, professional expertise, and experience:\n\n- -  the Supervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. The representation of women is generally considered to be the joint responsibility of the shareholder and employee representatives.\n- -  at least four of the members must, on the basis of their origin or function, represent regions or cultural areas in which Allianz SE conducts significant business. For Allianz SE as a Societas Europaea, the agreement concerning the participation of employees in Allianz SE provides the following: Allianz employees from different EU member states be considered in the allocation of employee representatives' Supervisory Board seats.\n- -  in order to provide the Board with the most diverse sources of experience and specialist knowledge possible, the members of the Supervisory Board shall complement each other with respect to their background, professional experience, and specialist knowledge.'",

With four female and eight male Supervisory Board members, the current legislation for equal participation of women and men in leadership positions (statutory gender quota of 30 %) is being met. In addition, the Supervisory Board has five members with international backgrounds. The skills profile is also met by all current\n\nmembers of the Supervisory Board. Based on the objectives regarding its composition, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has developed the following skill matrix. From the 2021 financial year onwards, it will be expanded to include 'Environment, Social & Governance' (ESG).\n\n## Supervisory Board of Allianz SE: skill matrix\n\n|                     |                                          | Diekmann   | Snabe    | Boissard   | Bosse    | Eichiner   | Hainer   | Burkhardt- Berg   | Le Goa\u00ebr   | Grundler   | Hayward   | Kirsch   | Lawrenz   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|------------|----------|-------------------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|\n| Tenure              | Joined Board in                          | 2017       | 2014     | 2017       | 2012     | 2016       | 2017     | 2012              | 2018       | 2016       | 2017      | 2018     | 2015      |\n| Personal            | Regulatory  requirement   (Fit & Proper) | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n| appro- priate- ness | Independence 1                           | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n| Personal            | No  Overboarding 1                       | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n| Diversity           | Gender                                   | male       | male     | female     | female   | male       | male     | female            | male       | female     | male      | male     | male      |\n| Diversity           | Nationality                              | German     | Danish   | French     | Danish   | German     | German   | German            | French     | German     | British   | German   | German    |\n|                     | Accounting                               | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | -          | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n|                     | Insurance  Actuarial  Practice           | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n| Expertise           | Investment  Management                   | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n| Expertise           | Technology                               | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | -        | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | -         | -        | /uni2713  |\n| Expertise           | Digital  Transformation                  | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n| Expertise           | Employee  Engagement                     | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n|                     | North America                            | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | -          | -        | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | -                 | -          | -          | -         | -        | -         |\n| Regional  Expertise | Growth  Markets                          | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | -          | -        | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | -                 | -          | -          | -         | -        | -         |\n| Regional  Expertise | Europe (EU)                              | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713   | /uni2713 | /uni2713          | /uni2713   | /uni2713   | /uni2713  | /uni2713 | /uni2713  |\n\n- 1\\_According to German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe current composition of the Supervisory Board can be found in the Supervisory Board Report.

        "page_content": "## Annual General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the AGM. When adopting resolutions, each share carries one vote. Shareholders can follow the AGM's proceedings on the internet and be represented by proxies. These proxies  exercise  voting  rights  exclusively  on  the  basis  of  instructions given by the shareholder. Shareholders are also able to cast their votes via  the  internet  in  the  form  of  online  voting.  Allianz SE  regularly  promotes the use of internet services.\n\nThe AGM elects the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board and approves the actions taken by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. It decides on the appropriation of net earnings,  capital  transactions,  the  approval  of  intercompany agreements, also on the approval of the remuneration system presented by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Board of Management and the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, as well as changes to the company's Statutes. Resolutions  of  the  AGM shall  be  passed,  unless mandatory legal provisions require otherwise, by a simple majority of the valid votes cast. In accordance with European regulations and the Statutes, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of votes cast, which at the same time represents the majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution, in case less than half of the share capital is represented in the AGM. Each year, an ordinary AGM takes place at which the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board give an account of the preceding financial year. For special decisions, the German Stock Corporation Act provides for the convening of an extraordinary AGM.\n\n## Accounting and auditing\n\nThe  Allianz Group  prepares its accounts according to \u00a7 315e of the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB') on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE are prepared in accordance with German law and accounting rules.\n\nIn compliance with the special legal provisions that apply to insurance  companies, the auditor of the annual financial statements and of the half-yearly financial report is appointed by the Supervisory Board, not the AGM. The audit of the financial statements covers the individual financial statements of Allianz SE and the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe inform our shareholders, financial analysts, the media, and the general public about the company's situation on a regular basis and in a timely manner. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements, and the respective management reports are publicly available within 90 days of the end of each financial year. Additional information is provided in the Allianz Group's half-yearly financial reports and quarterly statements. Information is also made available at the AGM, at telephone conferences for analysts and journalists, and on the Allianz Group's website. Our website also provides a financial calendar listing the dates of major publications and events, such as annual reports, half-yearly financial  reports,  and  quarterly  statements,  AGMs,  and  analyst conference calls as well as financial press conferences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou  can  find  the  2021  financial  calendar  on  our  website  at www.allianz.com/financialcalendar .\n\n## Information in accordance with the German Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and the Public Sector\n\nThis section outlines the targets set for Allianz SE  and the other companies of the Allianz Group in Germany that are subject to codetermination  (the  'subsidiaries  concerned')  for  the  Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the two management levels below the Board of Management.\n\nArticle 17 (2) of the German SE Implementation Act stipulates that as of 1 January 2016, the share of women and men among the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE must each total up to 30 % at least. The Supervisory Board currently in office fulfils this requirement as it includes four women (33 %) and eight men (67 %).\n\nIn August 2017, the Supervisory Board set a target for the percentage of women on Allianz SE's Board of Management at 30 % to be achieved by 31 December 2021. As of 31 December 2020, the percentage of women on Allianz SE's Board of Management was to 20 %. As regards the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of Management of Allianz SE has set a target of 20 % and 30 %, respectively, to be met by 31 December 2021. As of 31 December 2020, this target was already met for the first management level, with a percentage of women of 28 %, but could not yet be met on the second level with a percentage of 23 %. The first two management levels below the Board of Management comprise a very small comparative group of executives. No suitable female candidates could be identified for the very few positions that became vacant in the period considered.\n\nIn the longer term, Allianz aims to place women in at least 30 % of the positions at these two management levels throughout the Group.\n\nWith regard to the Supervisory Boards of the subsidiaries concerned, the target quotas for eight out of nine subsidiaries concerned were set at 30 % and the target quota for the remaining subsidiary concerned was set at 33 % for 31 December 2021. Seven of the nine subsidiaries already reached this target as of 31 December 2020. The target quotas for the respective Board of Management of the subsidiaries concerned were between 20 % and 30 % (24 % on average) for 31 December 2021 and were met by six of the nine companies as of 31 December 2020. For the two management levels below the Board of Management, the respective Boards of Management of the subsidiaries concerned had set target quotas between 17 % and 33 % (23 % on average) for 31 December 2021 for the first management level and target quotas between 20 % and 33 % (26 % on average) for  31 December 2021 for the second management level below the Board of Management. As of 31 December 2020, the targets were met by five of the nine subsidiaries concerned at the first management level, while five of the nine companies likewise met the targets set for the second management level. Despite increased efforts to promote women in the Allianz Group and also at the individual subsidiaries, it was not possible to achieve the targets ahead of time in these cases, as it was not always possible to identify suitable female candidates for all vacant positions. Allianz continues to work to achieve these targets.",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe remuneration report describes the remuneration structure and arrangements for  the  Board  of  Management  and  the  Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nAll information provided here concerning the remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management as well as some additional information  can  also  be  found  on  our  remuneration  website  at\n\n- www.allianz.com/remuneration .\n\n## Remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management\n\n## KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE BOARD REMUNERATION\n\nRemuneration is designed to be appropriate compared to peers, given the Allianz Group's range of business activities, operating environment, and business results achieved. The aim is to ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of the company that is in line with our corporate strategy. The key principles of Board of Management remuneration are as follows:\n\n- -Support of the Group's strategy: The design of variable compensation and in particular of performance targets reflects the business  strategy  and  sustainable  long-term  development  of  the Allianz Group.\n- -Alignment  of  pay  and  performance: The  performance-based variable component of the board members' remuneration forms a significant portion of the overall remuneration, corresponding to 70 % of the target compensation.\n- -Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder interests: A  major  part  of  the  variable  remuneration  reflects longer-term  performance,  with  deferred  payout  (64 %),  and  is linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz share.\n\n## DETERMINATION OF THE REMUNERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Board of Management's remuneration is decided upon by the entire Supervisory Board, based on proposals prepared by the Supervisory  Board's  Personnel  Committee.  If  required,  the  Supervisory Board may seek outside advice from independent external consultants. The Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board consult with the Chairman of the Board of Management, in assessing the performance and remuneration of Board of Management members. The Chairman of the Board of Management is generally not involved in the discussion about his own remuneration. The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management  in accordance with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in its currently valid version as well as with regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, while ensuring clarity and comprehensibility. Feedback from investors is also considered.\n\n## DETERMINATION OF AND ADEQUACY OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION\n\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the target total compensation and regularly reviews the appropriateness of the remuneration. This is based on both a horizontal comparison (i.e., with peer companies) and a vertical comparison (in relation to  Allianz  employees).  Again,  the  Supervisory  Board's  Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, if necessary with the assistance of external consultants.\n\nThe structure, weighting, and level of each remuneration component should be adequate and appropriate.\n\n## HORIZONTAL APPROPRIATENESS\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly benchmarks the Allianz SE Board of Management's remuneration against other DAX companies and selected international competitors, taking into account the situation of the Allianz Group as well as its longer-term performance, relative size, complexity, and global reach.\n\nThe horizontal comparison has shown that the ratio of the Chairman of the Board of Management's target compensation to that of a regular member of the Board of Management is equivalent to a factor of 1.75, whereas the average factor in the DAX is 1.96. Furthermore, Allianz  is well above average relative to size (revenue, number of employees, and market capitalization) compared to the DAX companies, while the level of target compensation for Allianz SE's Chairman of the Board of Management is average. For 2021, it was therefore decided to propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to adjust the  Chairman of the Board of Management's target compensation Outlook for 2021 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## VERTICAL APPROPRIATENESS\n\nThis comparison is based on the total direct compensation of a member of the Board of Management and the average direct compensation of an employee of the Allianz workforce in Germany. The Supervisory Board's decision in December is based on the factor resulting from this comparison for the previous fiscal year. For the fiscal year 2019, the factor for the Chairman of Board of Management to employee is '77' and the factor regular board member to employee is '42'. For the fiscal year 2020, the respective factor for the Chairman of Board of Management to employee is '66' and the factor regular board member to employee is '36'.\n\n## REMUNERATION STRUCTURE\n\nThe structure of the remuneration system of the Board of Management  became  effective  on  1 January 2019.  It  was  approved  by Allianz SE's Annual Shareholder Meeting on 8 May 2019 on the basis of the former \u00a7 120 (4) AktG, with a majority vote of 92 %.",

Perquisites are not linked to performance. Each member of the Board of Management is responsible for paying the income tax due on these perquisites. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the level of perquisites/uni003B a contractual annual cap applies. If an appointment to the Board of Management requires a  change of residence, relocation expenses are reimbursed to an appropriate extent.\n\n## VARIABLE REMUNERATION\n\nVariable remuneration aims for balance between short-term performance, longer-term success and sustained value creation/uni003B the payout of two-thirds of this compensation components are deferred. It is designed to balance risk and opportunity while promoting the sustainable implementation of the Allianz Group's strategy. The Supervisory  Board ensures that the targets underlying the variable compensation are challenging, sustainable and ambitious.\n\n## Target achievement factor to determine the variable remuneration\n\nIn line with the overarching strategic objective 'simplicity wins', the calculation  of variable remuneration follows a simple system. The annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial targets for the relevant fiscal year: operating profit and net income attributable  to  shareholders,  each  at  50 %.  The  resulting  target achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business division and the performance of the individual board member. If targets  are not met,  the variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is limited to 150 %.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GROUP FINANCIAL TARGETS\n\nThe Group financial targets are based on equally weighted targets for Group operating profit and Group net income attributable to shareholders.  Adjustments are only applied to acquisitions and disposals that account for more than 10 % of the Group's operating profit or net income attributable to shareholders or have a value-adding  effect from a risk management perspective (e.g. portfolio transfers) and were not yet known at the time the plan was prepared. This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from having a negative impact on the remuneration of the Management Board. Operating profit highlights the underlying performance of ongoing core operations. Net income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and non-controlling interests (minorities). Furthermore, the net income forms the basis for the dividend payout and for the return on equity calculation.  Both  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  are  important steering parameters for the Allianz Group and therefore reflect the level of implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Group's financial target achievement is limited to a maximum of 150 % and can drop to zero.\n\nThe minimum, target, and maximum values for the Group financial  targets are set annually by the Supervisory Board. These are documented for the respective next fiscal year and published ex-post in the compensation report.\n\n## INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION FACTOR (ICF)\n\nThe Group financial target achievement is multiplied by the ICF for each board member. The ICF is based on an assessment by the Allianz SE Supervisory Board, resting upon KPIs reflecting the respective board member's area of responsibility and his or her personal contribution.\n\n- 1\\_Net Promoter\u00ae, NPS\u00ae, NPS Prism\u00ae, and the NPS-related emoticons are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. Net Promoter Score \u2120 and Net Promoter System \u2120 are service marks of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld.\n\nThe ICF takes into account each board member's individual contribution to the implementation of the business strategy.\n\nSince  the  performance  is  determined  without  a  specified weighting, the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2. The concept of non-specified weighting allows the Supervisory Board to react appropriately to changes in priorities during the year.\n\n- -Business division targets: For board members with businessrelated  division responsibilities, the contribution to the financial performance  considers  various  indicators  of  profitability  (e.g., operating profit and net income) and productivity (e.g., expense ratio) for the respective business division. For board members with a functional focus, division-specific performance targets are determined based on their key responsibilities and qualitatively assessed.\n- -Non-financial  targets: Non-financial  targets  take  into  account customer satisfaction (e.g., Net Promoter Score (NPS 1 )), employee engagement  (e.g.,  Allianz  Engagement  Survey)  and  leadership quality, including strategic priorities. The assessment of the individual leadership  quality  also  includes  a review  of  behavioral aspects,  such  as  customer  orientation,  collaborative  leadership, entrepreneurship, and trust (e.g., corporate social responsibility, integrity, diversity, and sustainability as measured by the reduction of  the carbon footprint, greenhouse gas reduction, and a stepby-step plan to achieve net-zero compliant asset allocation until 2050  at  the  latest).

        "page_content": "## Variable remuneration components\n\nThe performance-related variable remuneration consists of an annual bonus and a long-term compensation (Long-Term Incentive - LTI).\n\n## ANNUAL BONUS\n\nThe annual bonus is derived by multiplying the target achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus and is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant fiscal year, with payment limited to a maximum of 150 % of the target amount.\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVE (LTI)\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the largest portion of variable compensation. It promotes alignment with shareholders  and  reflects  the  sustainable  implementation  of  the company's long-term strategy. The LTI is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually in the form of virtual Allianz shares, so-called restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs to be granted corresponds to the LTI allocation amount divided by the allocation value of an RSU at grant:\n- -The LTI allocation amount is derived by multiplying the LTI target amount by the annual bonus achievement factor and capped at 150 % of the target level.\n- -The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual financial media conference 1 . As RSUs are virtual stock without dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the net present value of the expected future dividend payments during the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years. After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based  on  the  relative  performance  of  the  Allianz  share,  the relevant  share  price,  and  the  results  of  the  sustainability assessment.\n\n-\n\n- Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute shareprice development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance of the Allianz  share into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Allianz share is benchmarked against the TSR of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index by reflecting the relation of the total performance of the Allianz share ('Allianz TSR') and the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index ('Index TSR') between the start and end of the four-year contractual vesting period. The payout will be based on the TSR performance factor which is calculated as follows:\n- -At  the end of the contractual vesting period the difference between the Allianz TSR and the Index TSR is determined in  percentage points/uni003B the result is multiplied with '2': As the comparison  with  competitors  and  the  market  is  of  outstanding importance, the outperformance/underperformance is weighted twofold.\n- -To determine the factor, 100 percentage point are added to  the  result. Example: 1 percentage point outperformance results in a relative performance factor of 102 %, 1 percentage point  underperformance  results  in  a  relative  performance factor of 98 %.\n\ndate to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index, their correlation, and the expected dividends. The value of the RSUs used for the board members compensation may deviate from this IFRS value, as a simplified calculation method was applied to increase transparency and traceability.",

If so, payment of the tranche may be canceled in full or in part.\n\nSubject of the sustainability assessment are:\n\n- -Compliance breaches,\n- -Balance sheet issues such as reserve strength, solvency, indebtedness, and ratings,\n- -KPIs entailed in the individual board members' targets, such as NPS, employee satisfaction, and climate targets.\n\nThe assessment is made applying a comparable basis, i.e., any regulatory  changes,  changes  in  accounting  regulations,  or changes  in  calculation  methods  for  the  KPIs  in  question  are taken into account.\n\n- -Allianz share performance, payout, and cap: Following the end of the four-year contractual vesting period, the granted RSUs are settled in cash based on the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE share following the annual financial media conference in the year the respective RSU plan vests, multiplied by the relative TSR performance factor and adjusted by the sustainability assessment, if necessary. The relevant share price is capped at 200 % of the grant price. Likewise, the relative TSR performance factor is capped at a maximum of 200 %. Taking into account the overall compensation cap (\u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular board member and \u20ac 10,000 thou for the Chairman of the Board of Management), the LTI payout in relation to the LTI target - which deviates from the individual LTI component caps - is limited to 255 % for the Chairman of the Board of Management and 272 % for a regular board member.

In the same way, variable remuneration components already paid may be subject to a clawback for three years after payout.\n\nAdditionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may occur if the supervisory authority (BaFin) requires this in accordance with its statutory powers.\n\n## PENSION CONTRIBUTION AND SIMILAR BENEFITS\n\nTo  provide  competitive  and  cost-effective  retirement  and  disability benefits, company contributions to the defined-contribution  pension plan 'My Allianz Pension' are invested with a guarantee for the contributions paid, but no further interest guarantee. Each year the Supervisory Board decides whether a budget is provided and, if so, to what extent. The current pension contribution generally represents 15 % of the target compensation of the board members.\n\nApart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62. Should board membership cease before the retirement age is reached, accrued pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may have additional pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of Management prior to 2015. Payments of social insurance contributions abroad required by Allianz in individual cases may also give rise to additional pension entitlements.\n\n## SENSITIVITY OF TOTAL COMPENSATION\n\nThe variable remuneration is designed to help achieve the operational targets and to reward sustainable performance. Therefore, payout of almost two thirds of the annual variable compensation will not occur for a period of four years/uni003B such payout is subject to sustainability assessment adjustments.\n\nA failure to meet targets may result in a maximum reduction of the  variable  compensation  to  zero,  with  the  overall  payout  being capped: The sum of variable compensation and base salary payout including pension service cost, which is paid in relation to one financial performance  year,  will  be  capped  at  a  maximum  amount  of \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management and at \u20ac 10,000 thou for the Chairman of the Board of Management:",

Shares will be acquired through mandatory pay component conversion. In case of a base salary increase, the shareholding obligation increases accordingly. The holding obligation ceases with the end of the mandate.\n\nIn combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management has significant economic exposure to the Allianz stock: It amounts to approx. 800 % of base salary for the Chairman and approx. 700 % of base salary for a regular board member:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TERMINATION OF SERVICE\n\nBoard of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years. For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance Code. Severance payments made to board members in case of early termination  are  restricted  according  to  the  German  Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## SEVERANCE PAYMENT CAP\n\nPayments for early termination to board members with a remaining term of contract of more than two years are  capped at twice the annual compensation, consisting of last  financial  year's base salary and 100 % of the variable target compensation. If the remaining term of contract is less than two years, the payment is pro-rated for the remaining term of the contract. Contracts do not contain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of Management service.\n\nIn the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the non-compete clause in case of premature termination of service.\n\n## TRANSITION PAYMENT\n\nBoard members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a  transition payment after leaving the Board of Management. The transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most recent base salary (paid for a period of six months), plus a one-time payment of 25 % of the target variable remuneration at notice date. Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, such pension is deducted from the monthly transition payments. In the event of a contractually  agreed  non-compete  clause,  the  remittance  of  the transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from the non-compete clause.",

In recognition of related benefits to the organization and subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, board members are also allowed to accept a limited number of non-executive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations. In these cases, 50 % of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE. The respective board member will retain the full remuneration for that position only if the Allianz SE Supervisory Board classifies the appointment as a personal one (ad personam) . Any remuneration paid by external organizations will\n\nbe itemized in those organizations' annual reports/uni003B its level will be determined by the governing body of the relevant organization.\n\n## TARGET ACHIEVEMENT FOR 2020\n\n## GROUP FINANCIAL TARGETS\n\nThe combined target achievement level of the Group's financial targets is calculated as the simple average of the achievement of the targets for the Group operating profit and Group net income attributable to shareholders. The targets set for both indicators were not achieved. This was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects/uni003B the overall achievement of these Group targets was only 75.58 %. If the effects of COVID-19 had been eliminated, the results would have been at least at the target level 1 .\n\n## Group financial target achievement level\n\n| Financial Group targets                  |   0 % - Floor in \u20ac bn |   0 % - Floor in \u20ac bn |   100 % - Target in \u20ac bn |   100 % - Target in \u20ac bn |   150 % - Max in \u20ac bn |   150 % - Max in \u20ac bn |   Actual in \u20ac bn |   Actual in \u20ac bn |   Achievement level in % |   Achievement level in % |   Weight in % |   Weight in % | Achievement level  combined in %   | Achievement level  combined in %   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                          |                  2020 |                2019   |                   2020   |                   2019   |               2020    |               2019    |          2020    |          2019    |                  2020    |                  2019    |          2020 |          2019 | 2020                               | 2019                               |\n| Operating profit                         |                     6 |                   5.8 |                     12   |                     11.5 |                 15    |                 14.35 |            10.75 |            11.86 |                    79.19 |                   106.24 |            50 |            50 |                                    |                                    |\n| Net income attributable to  shareholders |                     4 |                   3.8 |                      7.9 |                      7.5 |                  9.85 |                  9.35 |             6.81 |             7.91 |                    71.97 |                   111.19 |            50 |            50 | 75.58                              | 108.72                             |\n\n## INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION FACTOR AND VARIABLE COMPENSATION 2020\n\nTo calculate the annual bonus, the combined level of target achievement for the financial Group targets is multiplied by the individual contribution factor (ICF) determined for each board member by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn view of the unusual circumstances presented with the COVID-19 crisis, the financial performance of the Board of Management, including stabilizing the Group's solvency, has been rated as very strong for the financial year 2020. All business divisions are close to target or even slightly above. As in the previous year, the only exception is the business division comprising the Global Insurance Lines, Anglo-Saxon Markets, MENA, and Africa/uni003B consequently, it is almost the only area weighing down the Group's target achievement level.\n\nThe Board's overall strong performance was achieved on a sustainable basis. On the one hand, both employees and customers rated its crisis management as excellent, as reflected by indicators such as the Net Promoter Score, the Inclusive Meritocracy Index, and the Work Well Index Plus/uni003B on the other hand, Allianz fully achieved the target for reducing CO2 emissions. As a result, the combined ICF for the Board of Management was above 1.\n\nIn  the  assessments  of  the  individual  board  members'  performance, the underperformance of Niran Peiris'  business division has been addressed. However, in the area of credit insurance, one noteworthy achievement was the joint development of a protective shield for German manufacturers and suppliers in cooperation with the German government. The divisions of Ivan de la Sota, Sergio Balbinot, Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler, until 31 March 2020 under the responsibility of Dr. Axel Theis, and Jacqueline Hunt have carried the Group's operating result through the crisis. Giulio Terzariol as CFO ensured the balance\n\nsheet strength of the Allianz Group and thus secured the dividend payment to shareholders in the difficult crisis environment. His achievements in capital market communications were also highly recognized by the investment community when he was voted 'Best CFO' in the European insurance sector. Renate Wagner and the functional units she leads - Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, and M&A units - have also managed to contribute positively. One particular achievement was the fast implementation of specific supporting measures to help the organization weather the crisis, such as flexible remote working models, digital training and development offerings, and the creation of the necessary legal requirements for the virtual Annual Shareholders'  Meeting. In addition, the fact that Allianz  was able to go through with several acquisitions in Latin America, Spain, and Australia, despite the difficult conditions, also stands out positively. Dr. Christof Mascher's foresighted planning was another key factor in the smooth transition to remote working models, ensuring a high level of system stability. At peak times, up to 90 % of employees worked from home. At the same time, Dr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger continued to manage Allianz assets professionally and with a steady hand, in particular through the periods of considerable capital market volatility. Last but not least, Oliver  B\u00e4te  steered  the  overall  company  prudently  and  firmly, providing his Board of Management team with just the right impetus to defy the crisis. He was a true role model to the entire Allianz management team.\n\nIn addition to mastering the operational challenges, the Board of Management has also invested in the future: firstly, by improving the Property-Casualty retail and commercial lines and, secondly, by repositioning Allianz Global Investors and redefining the Life strategy in the view of the continued drop of interest rates.

The base salary, annual bonus, and perquisites are linked to the performance reporting years 2020 and 2019, whereas the Allianz Equity Incentive (AEI) payouts result from grants related to performance years 2015 and 2014.\n\nThe column 'Actual grant' is compliant with the disclosure requirements  stipulated  by  the  applicable  German  Accounting  Standard\n\nNo. 17. It includes the fixed compensation components, the annual bonuses paid for both performance years, and the fair value of the RSU grant for 2020 and 2019. It shows that the compensation system breathes with business development: The compensation reported for 2020 is significantly lower than in the previous year. The actual 2020 payout, on the other hand, may be higher for members of the Board of Management who were already appointed in 2015, as the payment of share-based compensation was due and the good share price performance had an impact on payout.\n\nThe sum of the total remuneration of the Board of Management for 2020, excluding pension service cost, amounts to \u20ac 32 mn (2019: \u20ac 39 mn). The corresponding amount including pension service cost is \u20ac 38 mn (2019: \u20ac 44 mn).",

2020 and 2019 represent the LTI fair values, which differ from the LTI allocation values. The determination of the LTI fair values is based on an option pricing model taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index and their correlation.\n- 2\\_The column 'Actual grant' is in line with the disclosure requirements under the German Accounting Standard No. 17.\n- 3\\_The annual bonus disclosed for performance year 2020 is paid in 2021 and for performance year 2019 in 2020. The payments for share-based deferred compensation (AEI and LTI), however, are disclosed for the year in which the actual payment was made.\n- 4\\_The share price related value increase is capped at 200 % above grant price for the AEI/RSU and at 100 % above grant price for the LTI/RSU. Furthermore, the value increase is limited by the overall payout cap. The relevant share price used to determine the RSU value, and hence the final number of RSUs granted, and the caps are only available after sign-off by the external auditors.\n- 5\\_Pension service cost in accordance with IAS 19: represents the company cost, not the actual entitlement or a payment.\n- 6\\_The appointment of Dr. Christof Mascher as member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE ended as of 31 December 2020. On the basis of a post-contractual one-year non-compete clause already provided for in his service agreement, Dr. Christof Mascher is entitled to an allowance ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') of 50% of his annual target compensation (sum of base salary and variable target compensation), i.e. a total of \u20ac 1,625.5 thou. Dr. Christof Mascher waived payment of the transitional allowance to which he would have been entitled. In any case, the transitional allowance would have been set-off against the non-compete allowance.",

allocation values. The determination of the LTI fair values is based on an option pricing model taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index and their correlation.\n- 2\\_The column 'Actual grant' is in line with the disclosure requirements under the German Accounting Standard No. 17.\n- 3\\_The annual bonus disclosed for performance year 2020 is paid in 2021 and for performance year 2019 in 2020. The payments for share-based deferred compensation (AEI and LTI), however, are disclosed for the year in which the actual payment was made.\n- 4\\_The share price related value increase is capped at 200 % above grant price for the AEI/RSU and at 100 % above grant price for the LTI/RSU. Furthermore, the value increase is limited by the overall payout cap. The relevant share price used to determine the RSU value, and hence the final number of RSUs granted, and the caps are only available after sign-off by the external auditors.\n- 5\\_Pension service cost in accordance with IAS 19: represents the company cost, not the actual entitlement or a payment.\n- 6\\_The appointment of Niran Peiris as member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE ended as of 31 December 2020. On the basis of a post-contractual one-year non-compete clause already provided for in his service agreement, Niran Peiris is entitled to an allowance ('Karenzentsch\u00e4digung') of 50% of his annual target compensation (sum of base salary and variable target compensation), i.e. a total of \u20ac 1,625.5 thou.",

The determination of the LTI fair values is based on an option pricing model taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index and their correlation.\n- 2\\_The column 'Actual grant' is in line with the disclosure requirements under the German Accounting Standard No. 17.\n- 3\\_The annual bonus disclosed for performance year 2020 is paid in 2021 and for performance year 2019 in 2020. The payments for share-based deferred compensation (AEI and LTI), however, are disclosed for the year in which the actual payment was made.\n- 4\\_The share price related value increase is capped at 200 % above grant price for the AEI/RSU and at 100 % above grant price for the LTI/RSU. Furthermore, the value increase is limited by the overall payout cap. The relevant share price used to determine the RSU value, and hence the final number of RSUs granted, and the caps are only available after sign-off by the external auditors.\n- 5\\_Pension service cost in accordance with IAS 19: represents the company cost, not the actual entitlement or a payment.",

target/min/max and LTI actual figures of 2020 and 2019 represent the LTI fair values, which differ from the LTI allocation values. The determination of the LTI fair values is based on an option pricing model taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index and their correlation.\n- 2\\_The column 'Actual grant' is in line with the disclosure requirements under the German Accounting Standard No. 17.\n- 3\\_The annual bonus disclosed for performance year 2020 is paid in 2021 and for performance year 2019 in 2020.

The  increase  of  the target compensation was actually already planned for 2020 due to the contract extension of Oliver B\u00e4te on 1 October 2019 and is in line with the usual approach at Allianz to increase the target compensation of the Chairman of the Board to market level only if - as in the case of Oliver B\u00e4te - performance and success prove\n\nIn 2020, Allianz Group paid \u20ac 6 mn (2019: \u20ac 5 mn) to increase reserves for pensions and similar benefits for active members of the Board of Management. As of 31 December 2020, reserves for pensions and similar benefits for active members of the Board of Management amounted to \u20ac 35 mn (2019: \u20ac 41 mn).\n\nIn 2020, former members of the Board of Management and their dependents  received  remunerations  and  other  benefits  totaling \u20ac 8 mn (2019: \u20ac 7 mn), while reserves for current pension obligations and accrued pension rights totaled \u20ac 166 mn (2019: \u20ac 153 mn).",

        "page_content": "to be sustainable. The increase was postponed and the originally planned resolution on the Board of Management remuneration system was not submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for approval in 2020 in order to be able to update the horizontal comparison once again on the basis of the remuneration reports of peer companies published in 2020. This horizontal comparison has led to the following conclusion: The annual target compensation  excluding  pension  contributions  will  be  increased  from \u20ac 5,687 thou to \u20ac 6,371 thou, and the overall compensation cap will be adjusted from \u20ac 10,000 thou to \u20ac 11,750 thou respectively. The ratio of the Chairman of the Board's target compensation to that of an regular board  member has thus been set at 1.96, up from the previous factor of 1.75. This factor corresponds to the average ratio of regular board members to board chairmen in the DAX. In addition, the compensation of the Board of Management was subjected to a horizontal comparison with DAX companies and international competitors. This showed that Allianz is in the 86 th percentile of DAX companies relative to its size (revenue, number of employees and market capitalization). The Supervisory Board has set the 75 th percentile as the appropriate level of  target compensation  in  terms of the  horizontal comparison. The target compensation of the regular board members is at the 75 th percentile and was therefore found to be appropriate, while the target compensation of the Chairman of the Board is only at  the 55 th percentile and was therefore not appropriate. The new target compensation of the Chairman of the Board is also at the 75 th percentile. The adjustment of the target compensation of the Chairman was made with the consent of the social partners (employee representatives of the Supervisory Board) of Allianz SE.\n\n## ADJUSTMENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT'S REMUNERATION SYSTEM OF ALLIANZ SE\n\nAt its meeting on 18 February 2021, the Supervisory Board adopted the current remuneration system for the Board of Management of Allianz SE. It differs only slightly from the system applicable until 2020 and takes into account, among other things, the current requirements of  the German Stock Corporation Act (ARUG II) and the German Corporate Governance Code through technical adjustments. The remuneration system for the Board of Management thus adopted will be submitted to the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\nThe first change relates to the possibility of temporarily deviating from the remuneration system in exceptional circumstances in accordance  with the statutory provision (\u00a7 87a (2)  German  Stock Corporation Act), if this is necessary in the interests of the long-term welfare of the company. The assessment may take into account both macroeconomic  and  company-related  exceptional  circumstances, such as impairment of the long-term viability and profitability of the company. Any deviation requires a prior proposal by the Personnel Committee. The components of the remuneration system from which deviations may be made in exceptional cases include in particular the base salary, the annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI), including  their relationship to each other, their respective assessment bases where applicable, the target setting and target achievement\n\nassessment principles, and the determination of any payout and payment dates. The duration of the deviation shall be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but should not exceed a period of four years. In a crisis situation, for example, this provision is intended to allow the appointment of a new board member, e.g., with crisis management expertise, with a compensation structure that temporarily deviates from the remuneration structure.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of extraordinary unforeseeable  developments when determining the amount of the variable compensation. This rule takes up a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and allows to adjust the remuneration in rare unforeseeable exceptional cases. Conceivable cases of application include, for example, significant changes in accounting rules or in the tax or regulatory framework, as well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting. The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable compensation.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may also adjust the target compensation of the members of the Board of Management insofar as this is appropriate to ensure that the compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Management or a regular member of the Board of Management is appropriate with regard to their duties and performance. In doing so, it shall take into account the comparison of board compensation horizontally and vertically. The aim of this rule is to adjust board compensation  moderately  on  the  basis  of  horizontal  and  vertical compensation trends and thus avoid major compensation increases. It does not constitute an automatic adjustment, but requires a justified decision by the Supervisory Board in each case. Such a moderate adjustment of the target compensation does not in itself represent a significant change to the compensation system. These adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective remuneration report for the reported financial year. The remuneration report is prepared in accordance with ARUG II and submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\nBy  way  of  clarification,  it  is  mentioned  that  members  of  the Board of Management appointed for the first time may be granted corresponding payments or benefit commitments in connection with the commencement of their appointment to the Board of Management of  Allianz SE in order to compensate for compensation or pension entitlements  forfeited with previous employers. Such compensation commitments are important for the possibility of attracting external candidates for the Board of Management. Payments made on the basis of these commitments are by their nature not considered with regard to the calculation of the overall compensation cap.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of the Allianz SE Supervisory Board\n\nThe remuneration of the Supervisory Board is governed by the Statutes of Allianz SE and the German Stock Corporation Act. The structure of the Supervisory Board's remuneration is regularly reviewed with regard  to its compliance  with German, European, and international corporate governance recommendations and regulations.\n\n## REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES\n\n- -In view of the activities and its business and financial situation of Allianz, the amount of the remuneration for the Supervisory Board is based on the fourth quartile of the Supervisory Board remuneration of the companies reported in the DAX.\n- -The  remuneration structure takes into account the individual functions and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members, such as chair, vice chair, or committee mandates.\n- -The remuneration structure allows proper oversight of business as well as independent decisions on executive personnel and remuneration.\n\n## REMUNERATION STRUCTURE AND COMPONENTS\n\nThe remuneration structure, which comprises fixed and committeerelated  remuneration  only,  was  approved  by  the  Annual  General Meeting in 2018 and is laid down in the Statutes of Allianz SE.\n\n## FIXED ANNUAL REMUNERATION\n\nThe remuneration of a Supervisory Board member consists of a fixed cash amount paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the business year for services rendered over that period. In  2020,  each regular Supervisory Board member received a fixed compensation amounting to \u20ac 125 thou per year. The Chairperson received \u20ac 250 thou, each Vice Chairperson received \u20ac 187.5 thou.\n\n## COMMITTEE-RELATED REMUNERATION\n\nThe Chairperson and members of the Supervisory Board committees receive additional committee-related remuneration. The committeerelated remuneration is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ATTENDANCE FEES AND EXPENSES\n\nIn addition to the fixed and committee-related remuneration, members of the Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of \u20ac 1,000 for each Supervisory Board or committee meeting they attend. Should several meetings be held on the same or consecutive days, the attendance fee will only be paid once. In addition, Allianz SE reimburses the Supervisory Board members for their out-of-pocket expenses and the VAT payable on their Supervisory Board service. The company provides insurance coverage  and technical support to the Supervisory Board members to an extent reasonable for carrying out their Supervisory Board duties. In the course of the latest change to the German Corporate Governance Code, the recommendation for a 10 % deductible for members of the Supervisory Board in the D&O insurance was deleted without replacement. In light of the reasons of the respective Code Commission for this change, i.e., that a deductible would not present a suitable means to increase the sense of responsibility and motivation of Supervisory Board members, it was decided to waive the deductible when signing a new D&O insurance contract in 2020.",

In light of the statutory provisions, the Annual General Meeting of Allianz SE will  vote  on  the  Supervisory  Board's  Remuneration  System  on 5 May 2021, which will also entail remuneration for members of the Nomination Committee. The remuneration is set at half of the usual committee remuneration and amounts to \u20ac 25 thou for the Chairperson and \u20ac 12.5 thou for a regular member. This remuneration takes into account the increased tasks in the selection of suitable candidates for the election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board as well as the increased selection frequency due to the proposed shortening of the term of office of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board from five to four years.\n\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board will also set up a Sustainability Committee, in particular, to closely monitor the sustainability strategy of the Allianz SE Board of Management. The remuneration is set at the usual committee remuneration level of \u20ac 50 thou for the Chairperson and \u20ac 25 thou for a regular member.\n\nThe following table shows the individual remuneration for 2020 and 2019:",

Business-related divisions reflect our business segments  Property-Casualty,  Life/Health,  Asset  Management,  and Corporate and Other. In 2020, they were overseen by five board members.  The  following  divisions  focus  on  Group  functions  and come with business-related responsibilities: Chairman of the Board of Management/uni003B Finance, Controlling and Risk/uni003B Investment Management/uni003B  Operations  and  Allianz  Services/uni003B  Human  Resources,  Legal, Compliance and M&A/uni003B and Business Transformation 1 .\n\nFor further information on Board of Management members and their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management.\n\n## TARGET SETTING AND MONITORING\n\nFor Allianz SE the same key performance indicators and target values as for the Allianz Group apply. In particular the key financial performance indicators are based on IFRS.\n\nThe Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments via an integrated management and control process. It begins with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare three-year plans, which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the basis for our capital management. The Supervisory Board approves the plan and sets corresponding targets for the Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of Management is linked to short-term and long-term targets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further details about our remuneration structure, including target setting and performance assessment, please refer to the Remuneration Report.\n\nWe  continuously  monitor  our  business  performance  against these targets through monthly reviews - which cover key operational and financial metrics -  to  ensure we can move quickly and take appropriate  measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz Group  uses operating profit and net income as key financial performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indicators include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for Property-Casualty, return on equity 2 and new business margins for Life/Health, and the cost-income ratio for Asset Management.\n\nBesides performance steering, we also have a risk steering process in place, which is described in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nNon-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to assess the organizational health of Allianz and are reflected in the annual bonus of the Board of Management. In line with our Renewal Agenda 2.0 motto 'Simplicity Wins', Customer Centricity and employee commitment - the two key levers identified -  are reflected in two KPIs: the Net Promoter Score (NPS 3 ) and the Inclusive Meritocracy Index. For further information on non-financial KPIs, please refer to\n\nthe Combined Separate Non-Financial Report for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE (according to \u00a7 289b (3) in conjunction with \u00a7 298 (2) of the HGB) of the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2020.\n\nFor an overview of the development and expected development of the most important financial and non-financial KPIs, please refer to the Outlook 2021 of the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2020.\n\n## Branches\n\nIn 2020, Allianz SE operated its business from Munich and from branch offices in Rome (Italy), Casablanca (Morocco), Singapore, Labuan (Malaysia),  Wallisellen  (Switzerland),  Vienna  (Austria)  and  Dublin (Ireland).\n\n## Takeover-related Statements and Explanations\n\nThe following information  is provided pursuant to \u00a7 289a  of the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB') and \u00a7 176 (1) of the German Stock Company Act ('Aktiengesetz - AktG').\n\n## COMPOSITION OF SHARE CAPITAL\n\nAs  of  31 December 2020,  the  share  capital  of  Allianz SE  was \u20ac 1,169,920,000. It was divided into 412,293,128 registered and fully paid-up shares with no par value. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. Each no-par value share carries one vote.\n\n## RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING RIGHTS AND SHARE TRANSFERS/uni003B EXERCISE OF VOTING RIGHTS IN CASE OF EMPLOYEE EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS\n\nShares may only be transferred with the consent of the company. An approval duly applied for may only be withheld if it is deemed necessary in the company's interest on exceptional grounds. The applicant will be informed of the reasons.\n\nShares acquired by employees of the Allianz Group as part of the employee stock purchase plan are generally subject to a three-year lock-up period. During the lock-up period, employees can exercise their voting rights.\n\n## INTERESTS IN THE SHARE CAPITAL EXCEEDING 10 % OF THE VOTING RIGHTS\n\nAllianz SE is not aware of any direct or indirect interests in the share capital that exceed 10 % of the voting rights.\n\n## SHARES WITH SPECIAL RIGHTS CONFERRING POWERS OF CONTROL\n\nThere are no shares with special rights conferring powers of control.",

A Vice Chairperson who is an employee representative has no casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes).\n\nAmendments to the Statutes are governed by Article 59 SE Regulation, \u00a7 179 AktG, and the Statutes. \u00a7 13 (4) of the Statutes of Allianz SE stipulates that, unless mandatory law requires otherwise, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting or, if at least one half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a majority in capital for a shareholder resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented at the General Meeting is sufficient, provided this is in line with legal requirements. The Supervisory Board may alter the wording of the Statutes (\u00a7 179 (1) AktG and \u00a7 10 of the Statutes).\n\n## AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT TO ISSUE AND REPURCHASE SHARES\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized to issue shares as well as to acquire and use treasury shares as follows:\n\nIt may  increase  the  company's  share  capital  on  or  before 8 May 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by issuing new  registered  no-par  value  shares  against  contributions  in  cash and/or in kind, on one or more occasions:\n\n- -Up to a total of \u20ac 334,960,000 (Authorized Capital 2018/I): In case of  a  capital  increase  against  cash  contribution,  the  Board  of Management may exclude the shareholders' subscription rights for these shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board (i) for fractional amounts, (ii) in order to safeguard the rights pertaining to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants, including mandatory convertible bonds, and (iii) in the event of a capital increase of up to 10 %, if the issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the stock market price. The Board of Management  may  furthermore  exclude  the  shareholders'  subscription rights with the consent of the Supervisory Board in the event of a capital increase against contributions in kind.\n- -Up to a total of \u20ac 15,000,000 (Authorized Capital  2018/II): The shareholders'  subscription rights are excluded. New shares may only be issued to employees of Allianz SE and its Group companies.\n\nThe  company's  share  capital  is  conditionally  increased  by  up  to \u20ac 250,000,000 (Conditional  Capital  2010/2018).  This  conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that the holders of convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participation rights, participation rights, and subordinated financial instruments issued against cash by Allianz SE  or its subsidiaries, based on the authorizations  granted by the General Meeting on 5 May 2010 or 9 May 2018, exercise their conversion or option rights, or to the extent that conversion obligations from such bonds are fulfilled, and to such extent that treasury shares or shares from authorized capital are not used for such purpose.\n\nUnder an authorization by the General Meeting on 9 May 2018, the Board of Management may, until 8 May 2023, buy back Allianz shares corresponding to up to 10 % of the lower of (i) the share capital at the moment of the shareholder resolution and (ii) the share capital at the moment of the buy-back, and to use those shares for other purposes (\u00a7 71 (1) No. 8 AktG). Together with other treasury shares that are held by Allianz SE, or which are attributable to it under \u00a7\u00a7 71a et seq. AktG, such shares may not exceed 10 % of the share capital at any time. The shares acquired pursuant to this authorization may be used, under exclusion of the shareholders' subscription rights, for any legally admissible purposes, in particular those specified in the authorization. Furthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares under this authorization may also be carried out using derivatives, provided such derivatives do not relate to more than 5 % of the share capital.\n\nDomestic or foreign banks that are majority-owned by Allianz SE may buy and sell Allianz shares for trading purposes (\u00a7 71 (1) No. 7 and (2)  AktG) under an authorization of the General Meeting valid until 8 May 2023. The total number of shares acquired thereunder, together with  treasury  shares  held  by  Allianz SE  or  attributable  to  it  under \u00a7\u00a7 71a et seq. AktG, shall at no time exceed 10 % of the share capital of Allianz SE.\n\n## ESSENTIAL AGREEMENTS OF ALLIANZ SE WITH CHANGE-OF-CONTROL CLAUSES AND COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS PROVIDING FOR TAKEOVER SCENARIOS\n\nThe following essential agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-control condition following a takeover bid:\n\n- -Our  reinsurance  contracts,  in  principle,  include  a  clause  under which both parties to the contract have an extraordinary termination right, if and when the counterparty merges with another entity or its ownership or control situation changes materially. Agreements with brokers regarding services connected with the purchase of reinsurance cover also provide for termination rights in case of a change of control. Such clauses are standard market practice.\n- -Allianz SE  is  also  party  to  various  bancassurance  distribution agreements for insurance products in various regions. These distribution agreements normally include a clause under which the parties have an extraordinary termination right in the event of a change of control of the other party's ultimate holding company.\n- -Shareholder agreements and joint ventures to which Allianz SE is a party often contain change-of-control clauses that provide, as the case may be, for the termination of the agreement, or for put or call rights that one party can exercise with regard to the joint",

Where such termination rights are exercised, the respective credit lines have to be replaced by new credit lines under conditions then applicable.\n\n- -Under the Allianz Sustained Performance Plan (ASPP), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) - i.e. virtual Allianz shares - are granted to senior management of the Allianz Group worldwide as a stock-based remuneration component. The conditions for these RSUs contain change-of-control clauses, which apply when a majority of the voting share capital in Allianz SE is directly or indirectly acquired by  one  or  more  third  parties  who  do  not  belong  to  the Allianz Group, and which provide for an exception from the usual vesting and exercise periods. In line with the relevant general conditions, the company will release the RSUs to plan participants on the day of the change of control, without observing any vesting period that would otherwise apply. The cash amount payable per RSU must equal or exceed the average market value of the Allianz share and the price offered per Allianz share in a preceding tender offer. By providing for the non-application of the vesting period in the event of a change of control, the terms take into account the fact that the conditions influencing the share price are substantially different when there is a change of control.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## NATURE OF OPERATIONS\n\nAllianz SE, the holding and reinsurance company of the Allianz Group, is  located  at  K\u00f6niginstra\u00dfe 28, 80802 Munich, and registered in the Commercial  Register  of  the  municipal  court  in  Munich  under HRB 164232.\n\nThe  annual  financial  statements  of  Allianz SE  and  the  consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group are published digitally in the Federal Gazette ('Bundesanzeiger').\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nOur financial statements and the management report have been prepared in accordance with the regulations of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Law on the Supervision of Insurance Enterprises (VAG), and the Government Order on  the  External  Accounting  Requirements  of  Insurance  Enterprises (RechVersV).\n\nAll amounts in these financial statements are presented in thousands of Euros (\u20ac thou), unless otherwise stated.\n\n## ACCOUNTING, VALUATION, AND CALCULATION METHODS\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets are recorded at acquisition or construction cost less depreciation. They are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of generally three to five years. In case of a permanent impairment, an unscheduled write-down is recognized. Based on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 248 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, the internally generated intangible assets are capitalized.\n\n## REAL ESTATE, REAL ESTATE RIGHTS, AND BUILDINGS, INCLUDING BUILDINGS ON LAND NOT OWNED BY ALLIANZ SE\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition or construction cost less depreciation. Depreciation is measured mainly using a straight-line method according to ordinary useful life. The useful life of newly acquired properties is based on the remaining useful life in the purchase report. For all other assets, we use tax depreciation tables. In case of a permanent impairment, the values of these items are adjusted through unscheduled write-downs.\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED ENTERPRISES AND PARTICIPATIONS\n\n## SHARES IN AFFILIATED ENTERPRISES AND PARTICIPATIONS\n\nThese are recorded at cost less impairments, in accordance with \u00a7 341b (1) of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nImpairments are measured either as the difference between the acquisition cost and the respective value, in accordance with IDW RS HFA 10 in conjunction with IDW S1, or as the difference between the acquisition cost and the lower share price as of 31 December 2020, or in some cases as the difference between the acquisition cost and the net asset value.\n\nWherever the market value on the balance sheet date is higher than the previous year's valuation, the value is written up to no more than the historical acquisition cost.\n\n## LOANS IN AFFILIATED ENTERPRISES AND PARTICIPATIONS\n\nThese items are normally recorded at cost less impairments, in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. However, when converting foreign currency loans into Euros at the reporting date, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\n## OTHER INVESTMENTS\n\n## STOCKS, INTERESTS IN FUNDS, DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER FIXED AND VARIABLE INCOME SECURITIES, MISCELLANEOUS INVESTMENTS\n\nThese items are generally valued in accordance with \u00a7 341b (2) of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 253 (1), (4), and (5) of the German Commercial Code, using either the acquisition cost or the stock exchange or market value on the balance sheet date, whichever is lower. We calculate the acquisition cost by averaging the different acquisition costs for securities of the same type.\n\n## REGISTERED BONDS, DEBENTURES AND LOANS\n\nThese items are recorded at cost less impairments in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. In accordance with \u00a7 341c of the German Commercial Code, amortized cost accounting is applied and the difference between acquisition cost and the redemption amount is amortized over the remaining period, based on the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## ASSETS TO MEET LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM RETIREMENT PROVISION COMMITMENTS\n\nThese assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) of the German Commercial Code, and offset against the liabilities in accordance with \u00a7 246 (2) of the German Commercial Code. Group life insurance contracts are recorded at asset value.\n\nIf the liabilities exceed the fair value, the exceeding amount will be shown under other provisions. If the fair value of the assets exceeds the liabilities, the exceeding amount is shown as an excess of plan assets over pensions and similar obligations.\n\nThe accounting and valuation method of the excess of plan assets over pension and similar obligations is the same as described in the section 'Other provisions'.\n\n## TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS, INVENTORIES, AND MISCELLANEOUS ASSETS\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition cost less depreciation on a straight-line basis. The expected useful life is based on the tax depreciation tables. Low-value assets worth up to \u20ac 250 are written off immediately. A compound item for tax purposes formed in accordance with \u00a7 6 (2a) of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) for assets from \u20ac 250 to \u20ac 1,000 is depreciated by one fifth each year.\n\n## DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\n\nWhen calculating deferred taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset.\n\nBased on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 274 (1) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code, the surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is not recognized.\n\n## REMAINING ASSETS\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed,\n- -bank deposits,\n- -accounts receivable on reinsurance business,\n- -other receivables,\n- -cash with banks and cash on hand.\n\nThese items are recorded at face value less repayments and impairments.\n\n## INSURANCE RESERVES\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -unearned premiums,\n- -aggregate policy reserves,\n- -reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses,\n- -reserves for premium refunds,\n- -claims equalization and similar reserves,\n- -other insurance reserves.\n\nInsurance reserves are set up according to the German Commercial Code and RechVersV requirements. The primary goal is to ensure our ongoing ability to satisfy reinsurance contract liabilities in all cases. Generally, reinsurance reserves are booked according to the cedent's statements. For claims incurred but not yet reported, or not sufficiently reported, additional reserves are calculated using actuarial techniques.\n\nInsurance reserves in the ceded reinsurance business are calculated according to the terms of the retrocession contracts.\n\nUnearned premiums are accrued premiums already written for future risk periods. They are calculated in accordance with German accounting principles, partly on the basis of information received from the cedents and partly using nominal percentages. Where unearned premiums are calculated using such percentages, these are based on many years of experience and the latest information available.\n\nAggregate policy reserves for Life/Health reinsurance are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are established for the payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but are not yet settled. Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses fall into two categories: case reserves for reported claims and reserves for losses incurred but not reported yet, or not sufficiently reported.\n\nReserves for premium refunds are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nFor Property-Casualty reinsurance, the equalization reserve, the reserve for nuclear plants, the product liability reserve for major pharmaceutical risks, and reserves for risks relating to terrorist attacks are calculated according to \u00a7 341h of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 RechVersV. The reserves are set up to moderate substantial fluctuations in the claims of individual lines of business. In cases where above-average or below-average claims occur, changes in the reserves mitigate the technical result for the individual lines of business.\n\nOther insurance reserves are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\n## OTHER PROVISIONS\n\nPension provisions are calculated applying actuarial principles. Other obligations  such  as  provisions  for  jubilee  payments,  birthday  payments,  early  retirement  payments  and  phased-in  early  retirement benefits are also calculated in accordance with actuarial principles.\n\nAccording  to \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the discount rate used for calculating the pension obligations has to be derived from a 10-year-average, for calculating other obligations it has to be derived from a 7-year-average.\n\n\u00a7 253 (6) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code states that a positive difference resulting from the calculation of pension obligations with the discount rate of 7-year-average versus 10-year-average is subject to the restriction on dividend payout.\n\nApart from that, with respect to the discount rate, the simplification option set out in \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code has still been applied (duration of fifteen years). The effect resulting from the change in the discount rate is reported under other non-technical result.\n\nFor further information regarding the accounting for pensions and similar obligations, please refer to note 15 to our financial statements.\n\nRemaining  other  provisions  are  recognized  at  the  settlement amount. Long-term provisions are discounted applying the net approach in accordance with IDW RS HFA 34.\n\n## REMAINING LIABILITIES\n\nThese consist of the following:",

        "page_content": "- -subordinated liabilities,\n- -funds held with reinsurance business ceded,\n- -other liabilities.\n\nThese items are valued at the settlement amount. Annuities are recorded at present value.\n\n## PREPAID EXPENSES AND DEFERRED INCOME\n\nAccrued interest and rent are valued at nominal amounts. Premiums and discounts carried forward as prepaid income and expenses are amortized over the remaining life of the related financial instruments.\n\n## CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nTransactions are generally recorded in the original currency and converted into Euros at the relevant daily rate (middle forex spot rate).\n\nLoans to affiliated enterprises denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Euros using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date and applying the strict lower of cost or market value principle.\n\nThe valuation of foreign currency shares in affiliated enterprises and participations, stocks, interests in funds, and other variable and fixed-income securities is performed by converting their value from the original currency into Euro, using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date.\n\nComparing the acquisition cost in Euros with the value in Euro as described above, the moderate lower-value principle is applied for affiliated enterprises and participations. For other investments, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\nAs a result of this valuation method, currency gains and losses are  not  separately  determined  and  shown  as  foreign-exchange gains/losses in the other non-technical result. Instead, the net effect\n\nof both changes (exchange rate and value in original currency) is reflected in the impairments/reversals of impairments and in the realized gains/losses calculated for these asset classes and is disclosed in the investment result.\n\nIssued debt securities and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Euro at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Unrealized losses are recognized immediately in the income statement, while unrealized gains are not.\n\nAll other monetary assets and liabilities with a remaining term of one year or less recorded in foreign currency are valued at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Both unrealized losses and gains resulting from the valuation of these foreign currency positions are reflected immediately in the other non-technical result as neither \u00a7 253 (1) sentence 1 nor \u00a7 252 (1) number 4 clause 2 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are applicable.\n\n## VALUATION UNITS\n\nAllianz SE made use of the option of forming valuation units as defined in \u00a7 254 of the German Commercial Code. This option is used for derivative contracts in which Allianz SE acts as an intra-group clearing agency. In this function, Allianz SE enters into derivative transactions with other Group companies and hedges the exposure resulting from these transactions by entering into mirror positions with the same term and structure but with different partners. Opposing positions whose performance completely offset each other have been combined into valuation units and form a perfect micro hedge.\n\nWhen  accounting  for  valuation  units,  we  apply  the  'freezing' method, which means that mutually offsetting changes in value of opposing positions (i.e., within valuation units) are not recorded in the income statement. More details regarding derivative transactions combined into valuation units are explained in note 17 to our financial statements.",

The fair value was determined during the fiscal year.\n\n## EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nInvestments in companies quoted on the stock exchange are generally measured by the stock exchange price quoted on the last trading day of 2020. Non-quoted companies are valued at their net asset value calculated by the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management's (DVFA) method. For recent transactions the transaction prices were used.\n\n## DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThese items are measured at the stock exchange value quoted on the last trading day of 2020 or, if there is no active market, at the prices obtained from brokers or pricing services.\n\n## LOANS\n\nLoans are valued using the Discounted Cash Flow method. Relevant discount rates are derived from observable market parameters and reflect the remaining life and credit risk of the instruments. In exceptional cases, the carrying amount is used as fair value.\n\n## BANK DEPOSITS AND FUNDS HELD BY OTHERS UNDER REINSURANCE BUSINESS ASSUMED\n\nThere are no differences between the book value and the fair value of those items.",

The shares have no-par value but a mathematical per-share value as a proportion of the issued capital. 1\n\n## AUTHORIZED CAPITAL\n\nAs  of  31 December 2020,  Allianz SE  had  authorized  capital  with  a notional amount of \u20ac 334,960,000 for the issuance of new shares until 8 May 2023 (Authorized Capital 2018/I). The shareholders' subscription rights can be excluded for capital increases against contribution in kind. For a capital increase against contributions in cash, the shareholders'  subscription  rights  can  be  excluded:  (i)  for  fractional amounts,  (ii)  if  the  issue  price  is  not  significantly  below  the  market price and the shares issued under exclusion of the subscription rights pursuant to \u00a7 186 (3) sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) do  not  exceed  10 %  of  the  share  capital,  and  (iii)  to the extent necessary to grant a subscription right for new shares to the holders  of  bonds that carry conversion  or  option rights  or provide for mandatory conversion. The subscription rights for new shares from  the  Authorized  Capital  2018/I  and  the  Conditional  Capital 2010/2018 may  only  be  excluded  for  the  proportionate  amount  of the  share  capital  of  up  to  \u20ac 116,992,000  (corresponding  to  10 %  of the share capital at year-end 2020).\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE has authorized capital (Authorized Capital 2018/II) for the issuance of new shares against contributions in cash until 8 May 2023. The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded. The new shares may only be offered to employees of Allianz SE and its Group companies. As of 31 December 2020, the Authorized Capital 2018/II amounted to \u20ac 15,000,000.\n\n## CONDITIONAL CAPITAL\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, Allianz SE had conditional capital totaling \u20ac 250,000,000  (Conditional  Capital  2010/2018).  This  conditional capital increase will only be carried out if conversion or option rights attached to convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participation rights, participation rights, and subordinated financial instruments, which Allianz SE or its Group companies have issued against cash payments according to the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 5 May 2010 or 9 May 2018, are exercised or the conversion obligations under such bonds are fulfilled, and only to the extent that the conversion or option rights or conversion obligations are not serviced through treasury shares or through  shares from authorized capital.\n\nConvertible  subordinated  notes  totaling  \u20ac 500,000,000,  which may be converted into Allianz shares, were issued against cash in July 2011. Within 10 years after the issuance a mandatory conversion of the notes into Allianz shares at the then prevailing share price may apply  if  certain  events  occur,  subject  to  a  floor  price  of  at  least \u20ac 74.90 per share. Within the same period, investors have the right to convert the notes into Allianz shares at a price of \u20ac 187.26 per share.\n\nBoth conversion prices are as of inception and subject to antidilution provisions. The subscription rights of shareholders for these convertible notes have been excluded with the consent of the Supervisory Board and pursuant to the authorization of the AGM  on 5 May 2010. The granting of new shares to persons entitled under such convertible notes is secured by the Conditional Capital 2010/2018. On or before 31 December 2020, there was no conversion of any such notes into new shares.\n\n## CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF ISSUED SHARES OUTSTANDING\n\nNumber of issued shares outstanding\n\n|                                                                  | 2020                                                             | 2019                                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Number of issued shares outstanding as of 1 January              | 416,577,182                                                      | 423,498,025                                                      |\n| Changes in number of treasury shares                             | 348,188                                                          | 365,959                                                          |\n| Cancellation of issued shares                                    | (4,879,731)                                                      | (7,286,802)                                                      |\n| Number of issued shares outstanding as of 31  December           | 412,045,639                                                      | 416,577,182                                                      |\n| Treasury shares 1                                                | 247,489                                                          | 595,677                                                          |\n| Total number of issued shares                                    | 412,293,128                                                      | 417,172,859                                                      |\n| 1\\_Thereof 247,489 (2019: 595,677) own shares held by Allianz SE. | 1\\_Thereof 247,489 (2019: 595,677) own shares held by Allianz SE. | 1\\_Thereof 247,489 (2019: 595,677) own shares held by Allianz SE. |\n\n## PROPOSAL FOR APPROPRIATION OF NET EARNINGS\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board propose that the net earnings ('Bilanzgewinn') of Allianz SE of \u20ac 4,375,716,820.22 for the 2020 fiscal year shall be appropriated as follows:\n\n- -Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac 9.60 per no-par share entitled to a dividend: \u20ac 3,955,638,134.40\n- -Unappropriated earnings carried forward: \u20ac 420,078,685.82\n\nThe proposal for appropriation of net earnings reflects the 247,489 treasury  shares  held  directly  and  indirectly  by  the  company  as  of 31 December 2020. Such treasury shares are not entitled to the dividend pursuant to \u00a7 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Should there be any change in the number of shares entitled to the dividend by the date of the Annual General Meeting, the above proposal will be amended accordingly and presented for resolution on the appropriation of net earnings at the Annual General Meeting, with an unchanged dividend of \u20ac 9.60 per each share entitled to dividend.\n\n## TREASURY SHARES\n\nAs  of  31 December 2020,  Allianz SE  held  247,489  (2019:  595,677) treasury shares. Of these, 47,489 (2019: 395,677) were held for covering future subscriptions by employees in Germany and abroad in  the context of Employee Stock Purchase Plans, whereas 200,000 (2019: 200,000) were held as a hedge for obligations from the Allianz Equity Incentive Program.\n\nIn 2020, 748,482 (2019: 365,959) treasury shares were transferred to employees of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries in Germany and abroad.

As in the previous years, no capital increase for the purpose of Employee Stock  Purchase  Plans  was  carried  out  in  2020.  Employees  of  the Allianz Group purchased approximately 75 % of the shares of the purchase plan at a reference price of \u20ac 167.76 (2019: \u20ac 210.21) per share and were allocated one additional share per three shares purchased, which is equivalent to a discount of approximately 25 %. The shares were sold to employees at a mean price of \u20ac 125.82 (2019: between \u20ac 157.66 and \u20ac 161.59).

Of this amount, \u20ac 868,005 thou (2019: \u20ac 888,178 thou) are due to the legal requirement for discounting pension obligations according to \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 1 in connection with \u00a7 253 (6) of the German Commercial Code.\n\nAnother  \u20ac 21,321 thou (2019:  \u20ac 18,864 thou) account for internally generated intangible assets according to \u00a7 268 (8) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code and \u20ac 1,404 thou (2019: \u20ac 1,352 thou) account for the surplus of the fair value of pension plan assets and phased-in early retirement plan assets compared to the acquisition costs according  to \u00a7 268 (8) sentence 3 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nAnother,  \u20ac 702 thou  (2019:  \u20ac 1,671 thou)  correspond  to  the mathematical value of own shares deducted from issued capital according to \u00a7 272 (1a) of the German Commercial Code.\n\n## 13 \\_ Subordinated liabilities\n\nSubordinated  liabilities  increased  to  \u20ac 16.6 bn  in  2020  (2019: \u20ac 13.4 bn). Of these, \u20ac 14.2 bn (2019: \u20ac 10.9 bn) were external subordinated liabilities resulting from bonds directly issued by Allianz SE. In 2020, Allianz SE placed a new subordinated bond with a volume  of \u20ac 1.0 bn and issued a dual tranche restricted tier 1 (RT1) bond comprising a USD tranche of USD 1.25 bn (\u20ac 1.1 bn) and a EUR tranche of \u20ac 1.25 bn. This increase was slightly offset by a book value decline of \u20ac 0.1 bn due to the foreign currency revaluation of our subordinated liabilities denominated in USD.\n\nFurther, intra-group subordinated liabilities amounting  to \u20ac 2.5 bn (2019: \u20ac 2.5 bn) were attributable to subordinated bonds issued  by  Allianz Finance II B.V.,  an  affiliated  enterprise  that  usually transfers the proceeds from these issues to Allianz SE via intra-group loans. Allianz SE provides a financial guarantee for the total amount of bonds issued by Allianz Finance II B.V.\n\n## SHARE BUY-BACK PROGRAM 2020\n\nIn its meeting on 20 February 2020, the Board of Management of Allianz SE  resolved  to  carry  out  a  share  buy-back  program  in  an amount of up to \u20ac 1.5 bn within a period between March 2020 and 31 December 2020 (Share Buy-Back Program 2020) based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2018. In  the  period  between  9 March 2020  and  28 April 2020,  a  total  of 4,879,731  treasury shares with a market value of \u20ac 749,999,985.35 were acquired for an average price of \u20ac 153.70. By resolution dated 4 November 2020, the Board of Management of Allianz SE decided to cancel the execution of the second tranche of the Share Buy-Back Program 2020 in the amount of \u20ac 750,000,000.\n\nAll of the treasury shares acquired within the Share Buy-Back Program  2020  have  been  redeemed  according  to  the  simplified procedure without reduction of the share capital.\n\n## Additional paid-in capital\n\n\u20ac thou\n\n| As of 31 December 2019     | 27,998,146   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Own shares: realized gains | 33,561       |\n| As of 31 December 2020     | 28,031,707   |",

Mainly the provisions for business interruptions, which  is  part  of  the  fire  and  property  reinsurance,  increased  from \u20ac 154 mn to \u20ac 511 mn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Provisions for motor reinsurance in particular declined.\n\n## 15 \\_ Other provisions\n\n## Development of other provisions \u20ac thou\n\n|                                                 | Provision  1 January 2020   | Use  (-)   | Release 1 (-)   | Additions 1 (+)   | Reversal of  Discounting  (+)   | Provision  31 December 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Provisions for pensions and similar liabilities | 7,207,002                   | 285,754    | 154,545         | 54,610            | 636,000                         | 7,457,314                     |\n| Tax provisions                                  | 466,951                     | 104,793    | -               | 54,904            | -                               | 417,061                       |\n| Miscellaneous                                   |                             |            |                 |                   |                                 |                               |\n| 1.

This growth resulted mainly from a net increase of pension liabilities by \u20ac 250 mn, which was  partially  offset  by  a  decline  of  miscellaneous  provisions  by \u20ac 141 mn, driven nearly solely by the reduction of provisions for anticipated losses (\u20ac 145 mn). The tax provisions went down by \u20ac 50 mn.\n\nAllianz SE has made pension promises for which pension provisions are recognized. Part of these pension obligations are secured by 'Contractual Trust Arrangements' (Methusalem Trust e.V.). Nearly all of these trust assets constitute offsettable plan assets, with the asset value/market value being used as the fair value.\n\n## CLAIMS EQUALIZATION AND SIMILAR RESERVES\n\nIn  2020,  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves  increased  by \u20ac 363 mn to \u20ac 2,572 mn. This was mainly driven by a lower claims frequency in the motor reinsurance and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit and bond reinsurance. Due to the sharp decline in the accident year claims ratio from 77.6 % to 68.2 %, the claims  equalization and similar reserves increased by \u20ac 416 mn in motor reinsurance. In credit and bond reinsurance, on the other hand, a decline of \u20ac 135 mn was recorded. This was mainly due to the decline in the premiums earned (net)  because of the  Corona-related  state scheme ('Corona-Schutzschirm') granted by the German government.",

As a result, Allianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of these old pension promises. The German subsidiaries reimburse the costs, with Allianz SE assuming responsibility for settlement. Consequently, these pension provisions are reported by Allianz SE.\n\nAs of 1 January 2015, Allianz SE completely assumed the obligations resulting from the agents pension fund ('Vertreterversorgungswerk' - VVW) from Allianz Beratungs- und Vertriebs-AG. Effective from 1 January 2017, the German subsidiaries reimburse only the service costs for their employees. There is no cost reimbursement anymore for the risks arising from changes in interest rate, inflation, and mortality tables.\n\nThe following table shows a breakdown of pension provisions:\n\n## Settlement amount of the offset liabilities\n\n\u20ac thou\n\n| as of 31 December                               | 2020      | 2019      |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Old pension promises of the German subsidiaries | 1,920,002 | 1,913,742 |\n| Pension promises of Allianz SE                  |           |           |\n| agents pension fund (VVW)                       | 5,522,013 | 5,282,603 |\n| old pension promises to employees               | 231,523   | 227,147   |\n| contribution-based pension plans                | 284,216   | 243,748   |\n| deferred compensation                           | 138,286   | 132,172   |\n| Total                                           | 8,096,040 | 7,799,411 |\n\nThe settlement amount is calculated on the basis of the projected unit credit method and/or reported as the present value of the entitlements acquired. In the case of security-linked pension plans, the fair value of the offset assets is shown.\n\nDue to the fact that there is no employment relationship between the tied agents and Allianz SE, and since Allianz Beratungs- und Vertriebs-AG no longer reimburses any costs, the pension obligations resulting from the VVW are recorded at their full present value.\n\n## Actuarial parameters\n\n%\n\n| as of 31 December                                                 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Applied discount rate (10-year-average)                           |   2.3  |   2.71 |\n| Applied discount rate (7-year-average)                            |   1.6  |   1.97 |\n| Rate of assumed pension trend                                     |   1.3  |   1.5  |\n| Rate of assumed salary increase  (inclusive average career trend) |   3.25 |   3.25 |\n\nContrary to the above rates, part of the pension promises are calculated using a guaranteed pension increase rate of 1.00 % p.a. of these pension promises.\n\nThe  mortality  tables  used  are  the  Heubeck's  RT2005G  tables, which have been adjusted with respect to mortality, disability and labor turnover to reflect company-specific circumstances.

Due to the lack of quoted prices on active markets for these financial participations and the uncertainty regarding the occurrence of the option conditions, the fair value of such options cannot be determined reliably. Wherever feasible, contractual arrangements including the option agreements were taken into account when determining the fair value of the financial participation. However, no stand-alone valuation of the options as derivative financial instruments was performed.\n\nEmbedded in a retrocession agreement covering the retrocession of life business to an external reinsurance partner, Allianz SE has provided the retrocessionaire with credit protection related to the issuer risk associated with ceded future cash flows arising from a corporate bond. The agreement obliges Allianz SE to pay an amount of \u20ac 87 mn to the retrocessionaire as compensation for safeguarding the reinsurance partner against default risk arising from a bond.

This is mainly attributable to a significant improvement  of  the  result  from  foreign  currency  translation  by \u20ac 486 mn, turning the result positive to \u20ac 343 mn after a \u20ac (143) mn loss in the previous year. Main drivers of this development were improved  foreign  currency  translation  results  of  liabilities  denominated  in USD (\u20ac 360 mn) and GBP (\u20ac 126 mn) caused by a stronger Euro in 2020.\n\nAllianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of the pension provisions of its German subsidiaries (see note 15 for more details). Expenses incurred in this context are recognized as service expenses from pension plans charged to group companies, as they are reimbursed by the German subsidiaries according to the cost allocation contract and result in corresponding service revenues.\n\nIncome from the release of other provisions refers to income from the release of pension provisions of \u20ac 142 mn in 2020. The reason is the decrease in the pension trend parameter of 1.5 % p.a. to 1.3 % p.a.",

As long as the corporate income tax loss carried forward  is  not  fully  utilized,  the  tax  compensation  payments  of \u20ac 732 mn (2019: \u20ac 485 mn) received from members of the tax group result in a tax income.\n\nThe  greatest  differences  between  accounting  and  tax-based valuation concern the balance sheet items 'pension accruals', 'reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses', and 'provisions for anticipated losses' resulting in deferred tax assets.\n\nIn addition, the existing corporate tax loss increases the surplus of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe valuation of the domestic deferred taxes is based on the following tax rates:\n\n- -31.0 % differences in balance sheet items,\n- -15.8 % corporate tax losses,\n- -15.2 % trade tax losses.\n\n## 27 \\_ Net earnings\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                         | 2020      | 2019      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net income                              | 4,607,731 | 4,603,376 |\n| Unappropriated earnings carried forward | 527,986   | 776,906   |\n| Transfer to other revenue reserves      | (760,000) | (900,000) |\n| Net earnings                            | 4,375,717 | 4,480,282 |",

As of 31 December 2020, USD 0.2 bn in commercial papers were issued as part of the program,\n- -Letters  of  credit  issued  to  various  Allianz Group  companies amounting to \u20ac 0.9 bn.\n\nGuarantee declarations totaling \u20ac 1.0 bn have also been made for life policies signed by Allianz Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A.\n\nContingent liabilities exist because  of indirect  pension promises organized  via  pension  funds  (Allianz  Versorgungskasse VVaG)  and support funds (Allianz Pensionsverein e.V.). The adjustment obligation according to Section 16 BetrAVG is not funded in the APV old tariff. Due to this and because of the sharp decrease of the discount rate, the plan assets of the support funds are less than the pension obligations. As  of  31 December 2020,  the  resulting  deficit  amounts  to  \u20ac 20 mn (2019: \u20ac 19 mn). In addition, Allianz SE has a joint liability of \u20ac 531 mn for a part of the pension promises of its German subsidiaries.\n\nIn the context of the sale of investments, guarantees were given in individual cases to cover counterparty exposure or the various bases used to determine purchase prices.\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE has issued guarantees to various Allianz Group companies totaling \u20ac 0.7 bn.\n\nAllianz SE enters into contingent liabilities only after careful consideration of the risks involved. On the basis of a continuous evaluation of the risk situation of the contingent liabilities entered into, and taking into account the knowledge gained up to the preparation date, it can be assumed that the obligations underlying the contingent liabilities can be met by the respective principal debtors. As of today, and to the best of our knowledge, Allianz SE assesses the probability of a loss resulting from contingent liabilities to be extremely remote.\n\n## LEGAL OBLIGATIONS\n\nLegal obligations to assume any losses arise on account of management control agreements and/or profit transfer agreements with the following companies:\n\n- -Allianz Africa Holding GmbH,\n- -Allianz Argos 14 GmbH,\n- -Allianz Asset Management GmbH,\n- -Allianz Climate Solutions GmbH,\n- -Allianz Deutschland AG,\n- -Allianz Direct Versicherungs-AG,\n- -Allianz Finanzbeteiligungs GmbH,\n- -Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE,\n- -Allianz Global Health GmbH,\n- -Allianz Investment Management SE,\n- -Allianz Real Estate GmbH (until 31 December 2020),\n- -Allianz Technology SE,\n- -AZ-Arges Verm\u00f6gensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH,\n- -IDS GmbH-Analysis and Reporting Services.\n\n## OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS\n\nThere are financial obligations of \u20ac 492 mn, which result from advertising  agreements (\u20ac 468 mn) and payment obligation arising from investments (\u20ac 24 mn).\n\n## LITIGATION\n\nAllianz SE is involved in legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings in Germany and foreign  jurisdictions, including the United States. Such proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business, including, amongst others, Allianz SE's activities as a reinsurance company, employer, investor and taxpayer. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ulti-mate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in substantial dam-ages or other payments or penalties or result in adverse publicity and damage to Allianz SE's reputation. As a result, such proceedings could have an adverse effect on Allianz SE's business, financial condition and results of operations. Apart from the proceedings discussed below, Allianz SE is not aware of any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on its financial position or profitability. Material proceedings in which Allianz SE is involved are in particular the following:",

The actions brought to date have included institutional investor plaintiffs and individual plaintiffs with certain plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of putative classes. An investment consultant has also asserted third-party claims against AllianzGI U.S. LLC. Plaintiffs in the pending actions have alleged losses of several billion dollars. In exchange for a tolling agreement, plaintiffs in the actions filed in the S.D.N.Y. have agreed to voluntarily dismiss claims against the Affiliate Allianz Defendants. In addition to the complaints filed to date, other investors in the Funds, or other third parties, may bring similar actions. Allianz intends to defend vigorously against the allegations contained in the complaints. AllianzGI U.S. LLC has also received information requests from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') regarding an SEC investigation of the Funds, and is fully cooperating with the SEC's investigation. The ultimate outcome of the court proceedings as well as the SEC investigation cannot yet be determined.\n\n## Board Members\n\nThe disclosures required in accordance with \u00a7 285 No. 10 HGB for the Supervisory Board and Board of Management can be found in the chapters Mandates of the Members of the Supervisory Board and Mandates of the Members of Board of Management.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration 1\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the Board of Management was comprised of ten members.

In addition, we have audited the management report of Allianz SE for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those  parts of the management report listed in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the  accompanying  annual  financial  statements  comply,  in  all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2020 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, and\n- -the accompanying management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial  statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the management report does not cover the content of those parts of the management report listed in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nPursuant  to  \u00a7 322 (3)  sentence 1 HGB  of  the  German  Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB'), we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (number 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany - IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Annual Financial Statements and of the Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in  our audit of the annual financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit  opinion thereon/uni003B we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matter of most significance in our audit was as follows:\n\n- -Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\n- -Matter and issue\n- -Audit approach and findings\n- -Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter, we present the key audit matter:\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF RESERVES FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\n\n## Matter and issue\n\nIn the annual financial statements of the Company, technical provisions  (so  called  'claims  provisions')  amounting  to  \u20ac 13,397 mn (10.6 % of total assets) are reported under the 'Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses' balance sheet item.\n\nInsurance  companies  are  required  to  recognize  technical provisions  to the extent necessary in accordance with reasonable business  judgment to ensure that they can meet their obligations from insurance contracts on a continuous basis. Defining assumptions for the purpose of measuring the technical provisions requires the Company's executive directors, in addition to complying with the requirements of commercial and regulatory law, to make estimations of future events and to apply appropriate measurement methods. This also includes the expected effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the recognition of the claims provisions of the affected lines of business. The gross provision is generally determined on the basis of the cedents' information or, in the case of outstanding settlements, on the basis of an estimate. The Company reviews the appropriateness of the cedents' information and, if necessary, makes appropriate increases to the amounts.\n\nThe methods used to determine the amount of the claims provisions and the calculation parameters are based on judgments and",

        "page_content": "assumptions made by the executive directors. In particular, the lines of products with long claims settlement periods, low loss frequency or high individual losses are usually subject to increased estimation uncertainties and usually require a high degree of judgment by the Company's executive directors.\n\nMinor changes to those assumptions and to the methods used may have a material impact on the measurement of the claims provisions. Due to the material significance of the amounts of these provisions in relation to the assets, liabilities and financial performance of the Company as well as the considerable scope for judgment on the part of the executive directors and the associated uncertainties in the estimations made, the measurement of the claims provisions was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n## Audit approach and findings\n\nAs part of our audit, we evaluated the appropriateness of selected controls established by the Company for the purpose of selecting actuarial methods, determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims in propertycasualty insurance.\n\nWith the support of our property-casualty insurance valuation specialists, we have compared the respective actuarial methods applied and  the  material  assumptions  with  generally  recognized  actuarial practices and industry standards and examined to what extent these are appropriate for the valuation. Our audit also included an evaluation of the plausibility and integrity of the data and assumptions used in the valuation and an analysis of the claims settlement processes and the reconciliation of the information provided by the cedents. In this connection, we also evaluated the assessment of the executive directors regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the affected lines of business. Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the provisions for selected lines of products, in particular lines of products with large reserves  or  increased  estimation  uncertainties.  For  these  lines  of products we compared the recalculated provisions with the provisions calculated by the Company and evaluated any differences.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are  appropriate  overall  for  measuring  the  technical  provisions  in property-casualty insurance.\n\n## Reference to further information\n\nThe Company's disclosures on the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims are contained in section Accounting, Valuation, and Calculation Methods in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the management report:\n\n- -the statement on corporate governance pursuant to \u00a7 289f HGB included in section Statement on Corporate Management of the management report\n- -the separate non-financial report pursuant to \u00a7 289b (3) HGB and \u00a7 315b (3) HGB\n\nThe other information comprises further the remaining parts of the annual report - excluding cross-references to external information -\n\nwith the exception of the audited annual financial statements, the audited management report, and our auditor's report.\n\nOur audit opinions on the annual financial statements and on the  management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information  and,  in  so  doing,  to  consider  whether  the  other  information\n\n- -is materially inconsistent with the annual financial statements, with the management report or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- -otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD FOR THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE MANAGEMENT REPORT\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial  position  and  financial  performance  of  the  Company  in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore,  the  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  the preparation of the management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors  are  responsible  for  such  arrangements  and  measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE MANAGEMENT REPORT\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  annual financial statements as a whole are free from material",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual  financial  statements  and  of  the  management  report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of  the  annual  financial  statements  and  of  arrangements  and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- -Evaluate the overall presentation, structure,  and content of the annual  financial  statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,\n\n- financial position, and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles.\n- -Evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Company's position it provides.\n- -Perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information  presented by management in the management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the  prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most significance in the  audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nASSURANCE REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH \u00a7 317 (3B) HGB ON THE ELECTRONIC REPRO-DUCTION OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE MANAGEMENT REPORT PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION PURPOSES\n\n## REASONABLE ASSURANCE CONCLUSION\n\nWe have performed an assurance engagement in accordance with \u00a7 317 (3b) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the reproduction  of the annual financial statements and the management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the attached  electronic  file  Allianz SE\\_AG\\_JA+LB\\_ESEF-2021-02-22.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of \u00a7 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format').
