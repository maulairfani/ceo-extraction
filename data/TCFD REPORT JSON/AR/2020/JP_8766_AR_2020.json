Ships and their cargoes required protection against maritime accidents on long voyages to and from distant lands. This led to the launch of Japan's first insurance company, Tokio Marine, in 1879. In this capacity we played a crucial role in developing Japan's economy and resolving attendant social issues. Our Group purpose is to support customers and society in times of need. We have stayed true to this commitment since our founding 142 years ago.\n\n'For every challenge there is risk. For every risk there is insurance.'

At first our UK business showed steady growth, but in 1894 it encountered financial distress. Two younger employees, Kenkichi Kagami and Hachisaburo Hirao, took up the challenge of unearthing what went wrong. It became clear that the UK office had been miscalculating the risk associated with major properties. Kagami and Hirao went on to scrutinize the firm's underwriting and accounting systems. They prescribed fundamental changes to assure rigorous risk management and reliable accounting that put the company firmly back on a growth track. Employee initiatives such as these are encouraged by our open and dynamic corporate culture, which has been part of our DNA from the beginning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe early years of our London office\n\nKenkichi Kagami (front and center), Hachisaburo Hirao (front, far left)",

More than half the capital city's population and countless more in surrounding areas were rendered homeless and destitute. Huge fires ignited by the quake caused the greatest damage and tragedy because most structures were made of wood. Fire insurance contracts, however, clearly state that coverage does not extend to fires or other damage from earthquakes. Against deepening socio-economic despair, Tokio Marine's Kenkichi Kagami, who chaired the insurance industry association at the time, coordinated funding so that all members could help policyholders by paying out 10% of the insured amount as consolation to aid national recovery. This action, which transcended contractual obligations, was taken in recognition of the public nature of insurance as social infrastructure.\n\nOn March 11, 2011 a very strong earthquake struck the east coast of Japan and triggered a massive tsunami. The disaster left more than 20,000 people dead or missing and caused economic losses totaling approximately 17 trillion yen, the worst on historical record worldwide. Such an unprecedented situation called for an unprecedented response. We settled more than 180,000 claims in less than two months. Many of us were personally affected by the disaster but we wanted to do everything we could for our customers and society. Every Tokio Marine employee knew in their heart that they were on a mission to give strength and support to all who needed it. The entire Group recognized that this relief effort deserved the highest priority in all areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2011",

In an era where the concept of insurance was still foreign, Eiichi Shibusawa, considered the father of modern capitalism in Japan, was deeply involved in the establishment of the Company after soliciting investment from various parties, calling insurance a national business.\n\nShibusawa discussed the close relationship between morality and the economy in his writings. The philosophy of companies contributing to the resolution of social issues, or, in other words, existing for the sake of society, has been part of our DNA since our founding. When we were first established, our mission was to contribute to the development of Japan's economy and society by protecting trade cargo from maritime accidents through ocean marine insurance. This aspiration to help society has been passed down over the years until the present day.\n\nProtecting our customers and society in times of need. This has been our unwavering purpose since our founding, no matter the era. Our business itself represents a solution to social issues. The more we grow our business, the better society will become through the solutions we provide. We engage in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness with this commitment and mission in mind.\n\nTo realize this purpose, we have worked to ensure a bright and vibrant place of work for our employees and collaborated with agents to help resolve a number of issues facing customers and society throughout our 142-year history. As a result, we have sought to achieve sustainable profit growth and return gains commensurate with investment to shareholders and investors. It is precisely because of these social issues that we have been able to hone our ability to resolve these issues and become a stronger company, which in turn has benefited all of our stakeholders and driven our business growth.\n\nCurrently, the business environment is changing rapidly and social issues, too, have become more complex. The needs of customers and society, along with the issues, are constantly influx as the times and business environment changes. For this reason, our efforts to achieve our purpose will never end.\n\nContinually providing all our stakeholders with value is hardly a simple task, but we will never stop trying to find the right solutions. With this conviction, we will continue to explore this path well into the future. The status quo is not an option; we must constantly seek to become a 'Good Company.'\n\n## Provision of Value to Stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEiichi Shibusawa who was deeply involved in the Company's founding (collection of Shibusawa Memorial Museum)",

Having continuously resolved social issues in the past, Tokio Marine has the ability to detect issues, the ability to develop products and services that resolve these issues, and the ability to deliver these products and services. Currently, we are building upon these abilities using digitalization and data to expand the peace of mind we offer to customers and society.\n\nSecond, we have the ability to manage our business portfolio.\n\nNo matter how good a product or service may be, if\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour business platform is not rock solid as the underwriter of risk, we will not be able to protect customers in their times of need. In this sense, our businesses must be sustainable, and toward this end Tokio Marine needs to prepare for these times of need by diversifying risk and stabilizing our business portfolio. Tokio Marine reviews its business portfolio using a forward-looking mindset to optimize its insurance businesses, which enables us to balance risk diversification and business growth as well as strengthen our business platform.\n\n## Third, we have the ability of integrated group management.\n\nTo adapt to global issues and continue to grow as a Group, it is vital that we work to resolve issues using the collective strengths of our diverse workforce. Tokio Marine deploys its diverse and talented workforce optimally inside and outside of Japan to incorporate and utilize their expertise and wisdom directly into the Group's strategy and across the Group, which enhances our ability to resolve issues and to generate synergies.",

Under these circumstances, continuing to meet the expectations of customers and society requires us to correctly and quickly identify changes in the environment and the challenges facing customers and society.\n\nTokio Marine shares information on indications of change and business matters from the frontline of its operations closest to customers and markets within the Group in a timely manner, with a focus on pertinent locations, articles and frontline sites.\n\nWe have established a system to collect the voices of customers and\n\nagents so that product and service developments and improvements are made through analysis that also involves consumer advisors.\n\nAt the same time, a medium- to long-term approach is also required when responding to new risks and needs.\n\nConsequently, we are working to research medium- to long-term environmental changes and risks and opportunities arising from such through the use of industry-academia collaboration, the Group's think tank, and outside research institutions. In actuality, the new three-year Mid-Term Business Plan launched in fiscal 2021 was formulated using backcasting from medium- to long-term business environment scenarios, in addition to current environmental changes (please see pages 34-36, 43 and 48-51).\n\n## The Ability to Develop Products and Services that Resolve Issues\n\nTo develop products and services that can clear up challenges facing customers and society, and to transform these into viable businesses, it is necessary to have appropriate premiums commensurate with risk and the ability to underwrite it stably.\n\nIn terms of appropriate premiums, our actuaries *1 analyze past accident data and outside data to quantify the frequency of accident occurrence and expected risks such as damages, which allows us to set the appropriate premiums in terms of ROR *2 . In recent years, we are also utilizing digitalization and data, such as Predictive Analytics *3 by TMHCC and big data analysis by TMNF and TMNL, to further enhance our risk analysis and pricing.\n\nIn addition, in terms of stably underwriting risk, Tokio Marine controls risk amounts appropriately using both global risk diversification and reinsurance in response to capital events *4 .\n\nIn this manner, our consistent and disciplined underwriting have earned us the highest ratings in the world from major ratings agencies with regard to our financial soundness.\n\n- *1: A person who compiles and analyzes statistics and uses them to calculate insurance risks and premiums\n- *2: Return on Risk\n- *3: Analysis for predicting the future by applying statistical methods to data\n- *4: An event that can damage an insurance company's capital, such as a large natural disaster that happens only once every few hundred years\n\nWe are researching ways to prevent and mitigate red tide damages using satellite imagery and ocean data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Ability to Deliver to Customers\n\nThere is no use developing a great product or service if it never makes its way to market. We believe the key lies in delivering the right coverage (products and services) to customers using methods that suit their needs.\n\nIn terms of right coverage, given the heightened intensity of natural disasters in recent years, we are conducting a nationwide campaign to check the details of customer policies so that we can propose to them the right amount of coverage needed. Amid the growing diversity and complexity of risks including cyber risk, we are proposing the right coverage particularly to SMEs, which tend to have a low insurance enrollment rate, by raising awareness of risks through tie-ups with commerce and industry associations.\n\nIn terms of delivery methods, for example, we are mixing both face-to-face and contactless services based on customer needs, from enhanced face-to-face consulting to enabling customers to use their smartphone to carry out procedures, to achieve the best possible customer service for each individual customer.\n\n## Policy procedures by smartphone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe ability to deliver does not stop with insurance policy procedures. We swiftly pay out insurance claims in the event of an emergency by utilizing digitalization to a high degree in quickly identifying damages through AI-driven analysis of satellite imagery or reenacting accidents using drive recorder data based on AI analysis.\n\nThe time created from these initiatives is allocated to operations only people can perform, such as loss prevention and addressing customer needs in a familiar and honest manner. This ensures that we continue to enhance the quality of the services we provide.\n\n## Examples of high-quality services in response to accidents\n\nSatellite image with an overlay of AI-generated flood assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUse of AI for vehicle accident reenactment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01",

Based on this commitment, since our founding in 1879, we have quickly and accurately identified the issues facing customers and society through the changing eras, and developed a series of innovative products and services that resolve these issues. We have also worked diligently to deliver these products and services and to give customers greater safety.\n\nAs a result, we have gained the trust and recognition of customers, enabling us to grow sustainably and provide value to all shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (1) 2017 Automobile insurance, 'coverage riders for expenses for saving victims'\n\n## Saving Victims Promptly Ahead of the Spread of Autonomous Driving\n\nWe were the first in Japan to develop a rider to facilitate payment of insurance proceeds to victims even in the event of an accident where liability is unclear due to progress in autonomous driving technologies (please see page 53).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (2) 2020 Acquired GCube to provide specialized insurance solutions to offshore wind power generators\n\n## Supports the spread of renewable energy\n\nTo support the shift to renewable energy, we acquired GCube, a global leader in the field. Also, in Japan, we developed insurance that seamlessly compensates the risk associated with offshore wind power generation projects, thereby supporting operators from the perspective of insurance (Please see pages 78-79).\n\nWe received the SDGs Strategy and Economic Value Award at the 2nd Annual Nikkei SDGs Management Grand Prix for our development of this product.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (3) 2020 Cargo insurance for transport of COVID-19 vaccines (UK)\n\n## Supporting Shipments of COVID-19 Vaccines to Developing Countries\n\nIt is typically difficult to underwrite insurance for vaccines because they can no longer be used if they are not kept at the right temperature. However, TMK of the U.K. together with Lloyd's developed cargo insurance that compensates the risk associated with temperature fluctuations during vaccine transport by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninstalling IoT devices on vaccine transport vehicles. The insurance pays out claims in less than three days in case vaccines are not kept at the optimal temperature, which facilitates transport of vaccines to developing countries.\n\n## (4) 2020 Medical Kit Yell (medical insurance with relaxed underwriting criteria)\n\n## Helping Extend the Healthy Life Expectancy of Seniors with Chronic Disease\n\nWe developed a new medical insurance product for seniors with chronic disease or health concerns, for which underwriting was previously difficult, using AI for big data analysis. We also offer services that help to prevent health conditions from becoming severe in response to the health needs of seniors (Please see page 29).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (5) 2021 Automobile insurance Drive Agent Personal\n\n## Achieving a Safer and More Secure Automotive Lifestyle\n\nWe were the first in Japan to provide customers with a dual-camera driving recorder with telecommunication function.

(HCC), where I was CEO, became a member of Tokio Marine Group. I am now leading Tokio Marine's global operations as the Co-Head of International Business. Here, I would like to talk about our strength that comes from our portfolio management ability while highlighting some of my own personal experiences.\n\n## Track Record of Portfolio Management\n\nInsurance is a business that underwrites risk. Under no circumstances can we allow the foundations of our business to be shaken. This is why the Group has spent some 20 years working to expand its insurance business overseas where there is a low correlation with natural disasters in Japan. These efforts are intended to balance appropriate control of risk amount and sustainable growth by diversifying risks across geographic areas, businesses, and\n\nproducts. Moreover, we not only acquire businesses, but on occasion we also divest them with a forward-looking approach, with the capital or funds raised from these transactions allocated to future acquisitions, leading to further risk diversification and business growth. Through this form of portfolio management, we have increased risk diversification effects up to 50% as of late, and as a result, our adjusted ROE has increased to 11.5% (FY2020).\n\n## Sustainable growth and appropriate control of risk *1\n\n## Risk *1 diversification effects (as of March 31, 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*1: ESR risk (99.95%VaR, after tax basis)   *2: Financial and other businesses, FX risk derived from net capital investments, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Portfolio management to date\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\nThe Story of Our Purpose\n\n- *3: UK non-Japanese business and some unprofitable non-Japanese businesses in other European regions (continue Lloyd's business)",

        "page_content": "## Domains and Companies Targeted in M&A\n\nFor Tokio Marine Group, M&A is not a goal but a method for global risk diversification. Aimed at achieving this goal, our main M&A targets in developed countries in Europe and North America are companies with little overlap with our existing businesses in terms of customer base and products in the field of specialty insurance *1 while in emerging countries are those companies mainly with a\n\npersonal line of non-life insurance in regions with large market size and high growth potential. Furthermore, while more than 80% of the profits of our overseas insurance business come from North America, we have been able to diversify risks because there is very little overlap in terms of customer base and products of our Group companies, even within the same region.\n\n- *1: Special insurance provided to corporations such as liability insurance and medical insurance, differentiated from standard auto insurance and fire insurance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stringent Acquisition Guidelines Emphasizing Cultural Fit\n\nWe have established the stringent acquisition guidelines of cultural fit, high profitability, and strong business models in order to execute disciplined M&A. Among these, we value cultural fit the most. Looking back, culture was perhaps the single greatest factor in HCC joining Tokio Marine Group.\n\nWe have a market intelligence (MI) function internally to identify deals and then compile long and short lists. Based on this list, the International Executive Committee (IEC), comprised of the Group's C-suite and head of the overseas insurance business holds discussions around 10 times annually to carefully screen acquisition candidates, but using quantitative metrics is not sufficient to judge\n\nan acquisition. More in-depth due diligence is needed to confirm cultural fit. During the Pure acquisition, I met directly with CEO Ross Buchmueller of PURE Group on several occasions. Once we even attended a Boston Red Sox baseball game as he is a big fan. As a result, the deciding factor for this acquisition became the strong sense of shared direction and chemistry fit gained from these dialogue.\n\nTokio Marine has executed M&A deals giving top priority to cultural fit, so conversely, there have been several deals that did not materialize because the cultural fit was not there, even though the guideline for high profitability was met.\n\n## Business Oversight Respecting Autonomy and High Growth of Target Companies\n\nIn addition to cultural fit, another characteristic of our M&A style that remains unchanged today is that we respect the autonomy of the target company and avoid invasive acquisitions. There are few companies in the world with a federated model for Group business operations like Tokio Marine. I believe that our integrated Group management under a federated model represents a unique business model.\n\nOn occasion, I am asked about consolidating business of an acquired company, but this would destroy the unique DNA of these companies. Since we acquire 'good companies' with a strong business model and high profitability, maintaining the target company's autonomy and having them fully utilize their own strengths lead to further growth after they join the Group. This is\n\nsomething I am convinced of from my time as CEO of Tokio Marine HCC (TMHCC), which in many cases used bolt-on M&A. In actuality, our large acquisitions of Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. (PHLY), Delphi Financial Group, Inc. (DFG) and TMHCC, which drive overseas profits, have shown growth above and beyond the market after joining the Group, and I believe Pure will soon join these three companies. This has enabled us to establish a top 10 position in commercial lines for Tokio Marine Group in the North American market, the world's largest insurance market. In particular, we are a leading player in the specialty insurance field.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition of HCC, Tokio Marine Group promised to respect the autonomy of HCC, and, of course, this promise has been kept to this day.\n\nSpecialized in HNW\n\ninsurance market\n\nMainly provides specialty\n\nproducts to corporations\n\n## Strong growth for four North American companies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                         | (USD bn)   | Top-line* 2   |                            |                | Bottom-line* 3                                                                                                                                               | Bottom-line* 3                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------|------------|---------------|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                         | 1.7        | 3.2           | 5.6 % PHLY                 | 3.6 % Market   | + 4.7                                                                                                                                                        | %                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Joined in December 2008 | 2008       | 2020          | 2008-2020 CAGR             | 2008-2020 CAGR | 2008-2020 CAGR                                                                                                                                               | 2008-2020 CAGR                                                                                                                                               |\n|                         | 1.5        | 2.7           | 6.5 % DFG                  | 4.7 % Market   | + 11                                                                                                                                                         | %                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Joined in May 2012      | 2011       | 2020          | 2011-2020 CAGR             | 2011-2020 CAGR | 2011-2020 CAGR                                                                                                                                               | 2011-2020 CAGR                                                                                                                                               |\n|                         | 2.8        | 3.9           | 7.2 % TMHCC                | 4.8 % Market   | 6                                                                                                                                                            | % *                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Joined in October 2015  | 2015       | 2020          | 2015-2020 CAGR             | 2015-2020 CAGR | 2015-2020 CAGR * Although the growth rate deteriorated  temporarily in FY2020 due to the  impact of COVID-19, the 2015-2021  CAGR is expected to reach 5.7%. | 2015-2020 CAGR * Although the growth rate deteriorated  temporarily in FY2020 due to the  impact of COVID-19, the 2015-2021  CAGR is expected to reach 5.7%. |\n|                         | 2014 0.3   | 2020 1.3      | 2014-2020 CAGR 25.0 % Pure | 4.6 % Market   | 2014-2020 CAGR + 24                                                                                                                                          | %                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n- *2: Net premiums written on a local accounting basis (For Pure, premiums under management company)   *3: After-tax profit on a local accounting basis\n\n## Forward-Looking Business Divestments\n\nOptimizing our business portfolio is an ongoing process of not only acquisition but also forward-looking divestments, to strategically interchange the portfolio. For example, Tokio Millennium Re AG (TMR), a reinsurance subsidiary established in 2000, was an important company forming the base of our full-fledged overseas expansion. We established TMR for global risk diversification through reinsurance and for learning about management of overseas companies. For the following reasons, however, we sold TMR in March 2019 after determining that it had served its purpose.\n\n- 1.  We were able to achieve risk diversification through primary insurance businesses from large acquisitions executed since 2008;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Closing\n\nOur proven M&A track record and reputation will help us find the next great M&A opportunity. This is one of our major strengths that few competitors can easily match. When I made the decision for HCC to join Tokio Marine Group, I, of course, saw the success of TMK, PHLY and DFG, but the fact I was able to talk to each CEO to learn the appeal of the Tokio Marine Group was also a major supporting factor. I believe that we can continue to grow together with the colleagues that have joined us in recent years, including CEO Ross Buchmueller of PURE Group.\n\n- 2. The earnings outlook in the reinsurance market is challenging due to the influx of third-party capital, and TMR, which generated profits of \u00a510 billion, would have difficulty securing satisfactory return on risk (ROR) in the future; and\n- 3. We felt that selling the business while healthy management is secured, which is important for employees and for the company.\n\nWe are able to use the capital and cash generated from the divestment to fund business investment that benefits further risk diversification and growth. Going forward, we will continue to review our portfolio in a flexible manner comprehensively incorporating the changes in business environment and business forecasts.\n\nWe are able to simultaneously achieve risk diversification and business growth by acquiring 'good companies' with low risk correlation and little overlap in terms of customer base and products. At the same time, we divest businesses and reallocate the capital and cash generated for further diversification and growth. By continually engaging in this disciplined form of portfolio management and evolving this approach based on changes in the business environment, we aim for sustainable growth while controlling risks and as a result increase the capital efficiency of the entire Company.",

As a result, for the entire Group to continue growing, Group companies must build a unique business model rooted in their regions and markets to\n\nestablish a dominant competitive position. In actuality, each Group company has established the strongest localities in each region where it operates by steadily enhancing its capabilities (please see pages 120 and 121). We are a global company precisely because of this strong local presence.\n\n## Generating Group synergies with the Group's capabilities\n\nOur strong localities are further refining their strengths and accelerating growth by fully harnessing the Group's capabilities of product lineup, underwriting capacity, and sales network. As a result, in the four areas of revenue (expanding topline), investment (expanding investment income), capital (optimizing retention/reinsurance*) and cost (reducing costs), Group synergies have materialized, resulting in profit contribution of around \u00a530 billion this year and over \u00a5130 billion since fiscal 2016.\n\nCompanies that can generate quantitative effects from such synergies are rare. This is why we give such importance to this within our strength of integrated group management. More concretely, most companies attempt to generate cost synergies by rightsizing their workforce, but in our case, our workforce has increased over the years because the companies we acquire\n\ngenerate even more growth after joining the Group. In addition to growing cross-selling (revenue) using our diverse and broad product lineup along with our global sales network, we are expanding investment income (investment) through DFG with its sophisticated know-how in asset management, optimizing retention/reinsurance (capital) including underwriting capacity, and steady progress with the necessary cost synergies such as joint purchasing of systems. Today, discussions about achieving these synergies are being held actively among each Group company rather than led by the holding company. For example, proactive discussions on generating synergies with PURE Group are taking place during the CEO conference in North America. In this manner, the Group's sense of solidarity is growing.\n\n- * Transferring some underwritten risk to other insurance companies through reinsurance for risk diversification and other purposes\n\n## Main areas for synergy generation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact on profits from Group synergies (cumulative)\n\n(USD mn)\n\n<!-- image -->",

We assign our talented workforce to the positions best suited to them globally. Best practices combining the expertise and wisdom of Group companies is deeply incorporated and utilized in the Group's strategies to enhance the execution of measures Groupwide.\n\nFor example, top management of acquired companies are appointed to the position of Group Co-Head of the entire Group's asset management and international insurance operations. Personnel with particularly advanced expertise also play an active role as a focal point of strategy being implementing cross-functionally across the Group.

In addition,\n\nthe Group works collectively on global issues as if by second nature.\n\nThe Post COVID-19 Task Force, in which top management from overseas also participates, was launched in the summer of 2020 and since then it has utilized the wisdom of our workforce outside of Japan to upgrade the Group's strategy aimed at the post-COVID-19 world (please see page 69).\n\nDuring the three years of the previous Mid-Term Business Plan, besides the novel coronavirus, Tokio Marine faced the challenges of natural disasters and a low interest rate environment. A major accomplishment during this plan was to enhance the capabilities of integrated group management by overcoming these issues using the Group's collective wisdom.\n\nTokio Marine's integrated group management was included in a case study *2 of the Harvard Business School for its uniqueness as a strategy.

in order to maintain the same passion during both emergencies and normal times as they go about resolving challenges. Tokio Marine is working to penetrate its purpose by hosting 'Majikirakai,' a group that talks about serious matters very casually, globally for various levels of employees, including between officers, officers and employees, and among employees. The important aspect of these Majikirakai is that employees have the\n\nopportunity to think about how their work is benefiting customers\n\nand society and how they can contribute to the world as a team. Through this dialogue, information is shared Groupwide and the meaning of work is further instilled in employees. At Tokio Marine, the CEO who also serves as the Group Chief Culture Officer (CCO) takes the lead in efforts for penetrating our purpose. He engages our employees around the world both physically and remotely to ask 'What is our business for?' to foster this mindset in our culture Groupwide.\n\n## Dialogue with employees aimed at penetration of our purpose\n\nMajikirakai led by CEO Komiya at PHLY (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMajikirakai led by President Hirose via Zoom (2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reinsurance\n\n## Barry Cook\n\nCEO of International Group at TMHCC (TMHD Global Reinsurance Advisor)\n\n<Main career>\n\nLeveraging her background as a lawyer at a global law firm with a focus on litigation, Caryn provides legal counsel to various global corporate functions across a broad range of issues, including in the field of employment and labor.\n\n## Cyber Insurance\n\n## Daljitt Barn\n\nCyber Centre of Excellence Global Head of Cyber Risk\n\n## Specialty\n\n## Philippe Vezio\n\nTM Asia Deputy CEO & Chief U/W Officer (Transferred from TMHCC Barcelona)\n\n<Main career>\n\nWorked as an adviser on reserving to global insurance companies for over 20 years at a major audit firm.\n\n## Legal & HR\n\n## Caryn Angelson\n\nTMNAS CHRO & CLO (Concurrent posting at TMHD)\n\n## Internal Audit\n\n## Desmond Yeo\n\nTM Asia Regional Head of Internal Audit (Additional post: HD)\n\n## Reserving *3\n\n## Daniel Thomas\n\nChairperson of International P&C Reserving Actuary Committee\n\n01",

This has remained the same no matter the time period. We also believe that this purpose alone should never change.\n\nCurrently, our business environment is changing profoundly and rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing expectations placed on the insurance industry as a form of social infrastructure. During such a difficult time, focusing solely on the conventional insurance business will make it challenging to continue to meet the true, constantly changing expectations of society and customers. For example, in response to the growing severity of natural disasters and rising number of cyber risks, are we able to fulfill our purpose simply by paying out insurance claims during an event? Needless to say, paying out insurance claims is the most important function of an insurance company, so our mission is first and foremost to carry this out without fail. However, preventing accidents, mitigating the burdens from these accidents if they occur, and quickly restoring and preventing recurrence are also important. Such peace of mind before and after an event and providing value beyond just the payment of insurance claims will likely become more\n\nimportant in the future. Therefore, we are dramatically expanding the domains where we provide value in a wide range of fields including health care, disaster prevention and mitigation, mobility and cyber, while thoroughly utilizing digitalization. In this manner, we are attempting to evolve into a company that is always there to aid our purpose of supporting customers in their times of need.\n\nAs the times change so does social issues and the solutions required. This is a given. As we approach a turning point today, we believe it will be important to carefully examine the domains where we should play a role and embark on bold reforms.\n\nTokio Marine will continue to contribute to a sustainable society and simultaneously increase social value and economic value (profit growth), while creating a cycle of business activities and solutions to social issues as a leader in solutions to social issues.\n\nBy quickly implementing this cycle of solutions to social issues and business activities along with continual improvement, we will continue to provide value to all stakeholders and become a 'Good Company' that is truly needed and trusted by all even a century later.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nBecoming a company that always supports its customers to support them in their times of need means not only paying out insurance claims, but also detecting possible accidents customers may encounter, helping prevent customers from experiencing these accidents, and offering advice that will help customers regain their health should they become sick. Internally, we refer to this as providing peace of mind before and after events. We believe that we will only be able to fulfill our purpose after achieving such a presence.\n\nDigitalization is one vital aspect that will empower us to expand business domains and evolve into a company that always supports its customers. For example, it may be possible to prevent customers from getting into a traffic accident by analyzing their driving tendencies. Obtaining customers' health data and\n\ninformation on their living habits may enable us to provide advice so that they are less prone to sickness or prevent health conditions from becoming severe if they do. The Tokio Marine Group's aspiration can be found here.\n\nIn July 2021, the Tokio Marine Group established Tokio Marine dR Co., Ltd. (TdR) to head up our core data functions in order to evolve into a company that always supports its customers. TdR will become a focal point of the Group's sophisticated digital capabilities and spearhead efforts to strengthen the Group's data analysis and solution development capabilities. Utilizing TdR's digital capability, we will provide powerful peace of mind before and after events in the fields of disaster prevention and mitigation, health care, mobility (please see pages 15 and 52 to 53) and cyber (please see pages 80 and 81).\n\n## Overview of Group-wide initiatives through TdR\n\n## Launch of business aimed at new value creation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExamples of expanding business domains *Please see pages 15 and 52 to 53 for mobility and pages 80 and 81 for cyber\n\n## Disaster prevention and mitigation\n\nIn recent years, Japan as a whole has seen an increase in the number of natural disasters causing significant damages. With regard to water damages in particular, the torrential rains that hit Western Japan in 2018, Typhoon No. 19 (Hagibis) in 2019, and the torrential rains in Kyushu in 2020 resulted in large scale flooding and rivers overflowing their levees.\n\nIn the case of flooding disasters, local governments must make decisions regarding evacuations in a swift and appropriate manner. For this reason, it is important to gather information immediately after a flood in a timely manner.\n\nAmidst this, in April 2021 TMNF and TdR (Tokio Marine Risk Consulting as of April 2021) newly developed a flood hazard prediction system using AI with the cooperation of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience. This system is able to instantaneously predict areas of flood damage, present threat levels in real time, and visualize the number of households and\n\nage-group-specific population in areas with high threat levels.\n\nGoing forward, TMNF and TdR will provide this system to local governments already using an integrated geographic information system (GIS) to contribute to strong local communities that are resilient in the face of natural disasters. As a result, we will earn positive evaluations from customers by preventing accidents before they happen and reduce the loss rate.\n\n## [Sample image of system screen] Instantaneous forecasting of flood areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health care\n\nAs we enter an era of 100-year lifespans and extension of healthy life expectancy becomes an important social issue, there is growing demand mainly among middle aged and elderly customers for living a long, healthy and independent life.\n\nGiven such environmental changes, in August 2020, TMNL released Medical Kit Yell, a medical insurance with relaxed underwriting criteria expanding coverage to people with chronic disease or people with health concerns, in order to deliver peace of mind to as many customers as possible.\n\nMedical Kit Yell analyzes big data to fundamentally change insurance underwriting criteria to expand the number of people eligible for insurance and to keep premiums low. In addition, people with chronic\n\ndisease or people with health concerns are highly interested in receiving support from a medical professional or finding ways to prevent serious complications associated with an illness. There is also growing interest in easing health concerns online owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical Kit Yell offers two new online services that deliver even greater peace of mind and health to customers as they go about their daily lives.\n\nMedical Kit Yell, which was developed extensively with digitalization, has recorded strong sales second only to Medical Kit R, our best-selling product ever *1 . TMNL will continue to deliver greater peace of mind to customers while utilizing the digital capability of TdR.\n\n## Examples of new online services\n\nWe offer online health consultations *2 , second opinion appointments, a first-of-its-kind in the life insurance industry where customers can designate a hospital, and exam booking services where customers can designate a physician or hospital.\n\nTo support customers' health management and efforts to prevent serious complications, we will offer a health advice app that supports people's everyday life, including eating, exercise and sleeping habits, using an AI-powered virtual dietitian.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: Limited to protection-type products\n- *2: Implemented within the scope of remote health consultations permitted under the 'Guidelines on Appropriate Implementation of Online Physician Visits.'\n\n## New value provided\n\nBe able to underwrite new risk and risks that we did not typically underwrite before (provide coverage)\n\nProvide new technologies and solutions in the field of early detection and prevention seamlessly linked with insurance products\n\nMake society a better place (eliminate accidents and improve health) by encouraging behavioral changes among customers and local communities based on risk visualization and future forecasting\n\nBecome a company that always supports its customers to support them in their times of need\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our company is no exception. These past three fiscal years (April 2018 to March 2021), which coincided with the previous mid-term business plan, have been particularly demanding. By successfully meeting these challenges we have also enhanced our management capabilities and confidence, which will serve us well as a global insurance company. Two of these successes are worth highlighting.\n\nFirst, and foremost, is the major progress in Integrated Group Management. We have been globalizing not only our business, but also our management. We expect the top management of acquired companies to contribute to our group as a whole while demonstrating competitive edge  through a distinctive market-driven business model. We also have appointed Group Company leaders as Group Co-Heads of asset management and international insurance businesses. In addition we have assigned talents to assume inter-company roles and responsibilities, appointing TMHCC's CFO to TMK's CEO, for example. Taking the best of Western and Japanese management styles, we optimize allocation of human resources within Japan and worldwide, leveraging talent and expertise in a united  Tokio Marine 'One Team' effort.\n\nThe Group has benefited from these global management skills applied to our previous Mid-Term Business Plan in many ways. To take one example, we established a global task force to identify changes and challenges post-COVID-19, and review existing strategies. We incorporated the implications of our findings into global and local strategies to capture next-growth opportunities. We also responded  to increasing natural disaster risk by revising our retention/reinsurance strategy *2 through Global Retention Strategy Committee discussion and implementation of measures that go to the heart of the issues.\n\nIt goes without saying that a global business faces many challenges. Yet as long as we share a strong culture and understanding of our Purpose-the answer to What is our business for ?-we will overcome obstacles by tapping into the expertise and knowledge of diverse talent pool. With mutual trust among our global colleagues, we can face any crisis, tackle new initiatives, and gain fresh insights.\n\nThe second success was strengthening our insurance business portfolio. Looking ahead, it is imperative that we optimize our portfolio based on diversification and growth potential.\n\nUnder the previous Mid-Term Business Plan and as growth drivers of our book, we acquired the Pure Group, made strategic investments in emerging economies, notably Brazil and Thailand, as well as in the renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, we divested TMR, our reinsurance subsidiary, which was our steppingstone for international market expansion. This rebalancing has honed our portfolio management capabilities while sowing the seeds of vigorous and profitable growth.\n\nThe challenges posed by the business environment under the previous Mid-Term Business Plan called for problem solving of a high order. Surmounting these obstacles has been a strength-builder for our management team, preparing us to go full-bore into the next stage of growth and make the new Mid-Term Business Plan a resounding success.\n\n- *1: Skyrocketing compensatory awards resulting from aggressive litigation practices, plaintiff-friendly jury composition, and other trends.\n\nIntegrated Group Management\n\nSee pp. 22-25\n\n- *2: Risk diversification through transfer of a portion of exposure to another insurer.\n\nPortfolio\n\nManagement Ability See pp. 18-21",

Customer needs have also shifted dramatically. Such changes were in progress, but the pandemic has brought them into focus. Although the pre- and post-pandemic issues are largely unchanged, the speed of change has doubled or tripled, constraining projections and ruling out predictions, even two or three years ahead. In this age of high discontinuity, neither received wisdom nor past success apply. Rather, outcomes that defy logic and expectations are the norm.\n\nThe role of insurance becomes critical in these turbulent times of escalating and evolving risks for customers and society. 'Business as usual' will neither sustain our Group nor serve our clients and communities we are committed to protecting. Meaningful change depends on reimagining ourselves to meet the changing expectations of all whom we support through our products and services, while never forgetting our core purpose, our roots, our passionate dedication. By changing ourselves first, we can refine our approach and strengthen our impact on social issues while solidifying our foundation for sustainable growth. In this context, we place solving social issues at the center of our strategy in the new Mid-Term Business Plan (April 2021 to March 2024) and implement the 2+1 Growth Strategy with a sense of urgency and speed.\n\nThe 2+1 Growth Strategy is first about identifying new markets and designing new approaches based on accurate and insightful understanding of how customer needs are\n\n## Special Feature 2:\n\nResponse to COVID-19 See pp. 68-69\n\nOverview of New Mid-Term Business Plan See pp. 48-49\n\nchanging. The global shift to renewable energy and the rise in cyber risks are but two examples that demand attention. Another is Japan's declining birthrate and aging population which has put enormous pressure on healthcare, where issues are snowballing and rural industries and economies are on a steep downhill slope. The importance of these social issues will only increase over the next two decades. We are intent, therefore, upon discovering new opportunities and markets created by this evolving environment.\n\nWith this perspective, we will respond not only to emerging risk, but also to risks previously considered unsuitable for underwriting. Digital technology and data tools can enhance our value proposition and expand our coverage to support loss prevention, damage mitigation, rapid recovery, and deterrence. We will also determine the best mix of face-to-face and remote customer interaction. In terms of providing value, we want the name Tokio Marine to evoke the frontrunner in renewable energy and cyber risk, as well as healthcare and SME.\n\nThe second thrust of the 2+1 strategy is to boost profitability of our core insurance business by revising premiums and raising business efficiency. In this way, we will continue to deliver the value our customers seek, and secure appropriate profits in the face of low interest rates, frequent natural disasters, and other challenges.\n\nRevising insurance premiums is an urgent task if we are to achieve profitability for fire insurance, which, in Japan, is perpetually in the red. Although the overall Japanese portfolio is in the black, this neither reduces our obligations to our shareholders, nor permits us to neglect an unsound situation in terms of fairness to policyholders.\n\nThe frequency of natural disasters in Japan makes fire insurance indispensable and has led to a chronic deficit becoming the status quo. We are committed to rebuilding fire insurance into a sustainable system, a goal premised upon cutting operating costs. This goal also calls for revising premium levels and products, strengthening underwriting, and enhancing disaster resilience through prevention, mitigation, and early recovery.\n\nOutside Japan, the market is hardening *3 largely due to uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and social inflation. In this hardening market environment, simply increasing topline is easy. The difficulty lies in disciplined underwriting amid rising loss costs *4 . If our underwriting rates do not rise accordingly, we will end up regretting it in a few years as we face profit deterioration due to the need to increase the claims reserve *5 . We will, therefore, continue to maintain our bottom line focus and boost our underwriting profit by not only raising premiums to exceed future loss costs but also achieving steady growth that outperforms the market.\n\nNext is to improve business efficiency. We will reduce administrative tasks by applying digital technology, which particularly suits and benefits our retail business concentrated in Japan and Asia. The point is not to get by with fewer personnel. Rather, it is to liberate time and resources for tasks best performed with a human touch, such as tackling social issues, enhancing our value proposition, developing talent, and getting closer to customers. By integrating people power and digital technology in this way, we will also seek to reduce loss costs and drive growth.\n\nI have, so far, covered two thrusts of the 2+1 strategy: first, new markets and new approaches, and second, boosting profitability of our core insurance business. The +1 part of the strategy builds on these by focusing on business investment for the next growth stage through M&A and the launch of new businesses. In short, we will take measures that consider our current situation as well as the long-term horizon. Both must be taken into account if we are to deliver value that supports our customers and society on an ongoing basis, at home and worldwide.\n\nTo take on the financial risk of our customers, we must make sure that our business foundation stands firm, whatever happens. To buttress our strength and stability, we have been globally diversifying the Group's risk portfolio since the beginning of this century. The past several years have been characterized by natural disasters of unusual frequency and severity, and by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have succeeded in limiting the impact of these\n\n## Approach to material issues (Special Feature 3-1, 2, 3)\n\nSee pp. 78-83\n\n## Improving Fire Insurance Earnings\n\nSee p. 55\n\n## Developed Markets Strategy\n\nSee pp. 59-61\n\n- *3: A period of rising premiums\n- *4: The total costs of covering claims\n- *5: Funds set aside to settle future claims\n\nAchieving Sustainable Growth by Improving Business Efficiency See p. 56",

The more complex the risks and social issues we face, the more diversification we will need, not only in risk exposure but also in revenue sources. This is why I am intent upon exploring investment opportunities with a five to ten year horizon.\n\nI will also consider opportunities beyond the insurance domain if they fortify our business foundation by speaking to our strengths and creating synergies.\n\nImplementing the 2+1 Growth Strategy, we have set KPI targets for the new MTP at an adjusted net income CAGR of +3 to 7% and an adjusted ROE of around 12%. This refers to internal cumulative growth, without factoring in M&A, and puts us within reach of the milestones we set in 2017 of JPY +500 billion adjusted net profit and around 12% adjusted ROE. If we are successful with a large-scale M&A, we may see even greater growth or achieve our goals earlier than projected.\n\n## True to our purpose at a time of historic change\n\n## Raising social value and economic value (profit) by linking business activities to social solutions in a virtuous circle\n\nThe new Mid-Term Business Plan details our strategy for continued growth amid turbulent change. This is not, however, an objective in itself, but rather a means to an end. Since our founding 142 years ago, one purpose has driven us: to protect our customers and society in their time of need.\n\nIn 1879, people in the insurance industry did not think in terms of concepts like 'sustainability' and 'ESG.' But since our founding, we have grown sustainably by identifying the social issues of the times and contributing to their resolution. We run our business in a way that addresses social issues, such that profit and social solutions go hand in hand, benefiting everyone, everywhere we operate.\n\nToday, business is at a turning point as corporations worldwide are recognizing that sustainability is essential to keep civilization afloat. Solving social problems through our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness is an ongoing journey where our efforts are repaid in profit and quality of life for all.\n\nSocial issues change with the times, as do the solutions. It is critical, therefore, to accurately grasp the issues, propose hypotheses, and rigorously test their validity in a rapid cycle. Only then can we hope to responsibly implement solutions with confidence, speed and effectiveness.\n\nIn April 2021 we configured an organizational platform to manage this approach to social issues and solutions. The new position of Group Chief Sustainability Officer (CSUO) was created along with a global Sustainability Committee, consisting of our C-suite executives. As part of our corporate social responsibility the Group has a duty to pass on to future generations a sustainable global environment. By accepting this duty, we have positioned future\n\ngenerations as stakeholders, together with customers, society, employees, and shareholders and investors. After reviewing the Group's sustainability action materiality in light of our purpose, we identified four core challenges for our business and for addressing stakeholder concerns and expectations. These four are: to promote climate actions, enhance disaster resilience, support wellness and healthy living, and promote innovative applications of digital technology.\n\nOf these four, two are of particular importance as social issues in our home market of Japan, given its history of natural disasters. These are promotion of climate actions and enhancement of disaster resilience. They are also issues in common with many other areas of the world. We are committed to tackling these issues head-on around the globe as part of our mission to serve society. Our ideal is to realize a world where everyone can benefit from a shared resilience to natural disaster risk and an enhanced ability to coexist with it. In this capacity we will continue to move forward with counter-measures, leveraging the entire Group's strengths in our effort to respond to natural disasters and climate change.\n\nDomestically, we see opportunities to address longevity risk, asset formation, and other mounting needs of the world's most aged population. Globally, people's health concerns and awareness have been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. With our integrated business model for life and non-life, healthcare is a segment where we can demonstrate proven competence in protecting our customers throughout their lives and thereafter. Using digital technology and data analysis, we innovate products and services that cover the full range of customer risk, including presymptomatic illness and prevention, as well as promotion of fitness and wellness. Group-wide, we are committed to a future where everyone can confidently live their life to the fullest.\n\nBy linking business activities to social solutions in a virtuous circle, we will continue to simultaneously enhance the Group's economic value (profit) and social value in this way.\n\n## Through D&I and by understanding our Purpose, we will refocus and re-energize our 40,000+ workforce\n\nOur people and culture are our foundation for sustainable growth and the resolution of social issues. Insurance has been called a business of paper, pencils, and people, because its products are intangible. Technology has made pencils and paper irrelevant. Now people are paramount; they are the engine of our business.\n\nThis is why I place such a high priority on developing and leveraging the full potential of Group employees. Innovation is essential for Group growth. Innovation is created through the cross-fertilization of ideas, which happens when people of diverse expertise and experience come together to discuss issues and solutions. In other words, innovation grows out of D&I.\n\nStudying in the U.S. I experienced firsthand how D&I catalyzes innovation. My circle at the time included people of various ethnicities, racial groups and other identities, as well as both recent graduates and mid-career professionals. Since we did not share a common background, we could not anticipate each other's opinions or reactions. To be understood we had to express our thoughts lucidly and concisely, without ambiguity or circumlocution.\n\nBased on the premise that everyone's ideas were different, we engaged in vigorous intellectual combat, constructively arguing for or against each opinion. On numerous occasions, I witnessed the birth of a smart new idea in a flash of inspiration, as if a chemical reaction had occurred, though I could not have even imagined it on my own.\n\nAfter a bitterly fought argument over one issue, they switch effortlessly to a constructive discussion of the next, without a hint of animosity carrying over. This kind of communication is deep, fast, and effective for high-quality decision-making.\n\nOur company operates in 46 countries and regions with a diverse workforce, over 40,000-strong. We are also blessed with an open and dynamic corporate culture that has sustained us since our founding.\n\n## Sustainability Management\n\nSee pp. 70-77\n\n## Special Feature 3-1: Promoting the Shift to Renewable Energy\n\nSee pp. 78-79\n\n## Information Disclosure Following TCFD Recommendations\n\nSee pp. 84-91\n\n## Special Feature 3-3: Providing Solutions for the Healthcare Sector\n\nSee pp. 82-83",

        "page_content": "Message from the Group CDIO See pp. 66-67\n\nSpecial Feature 1: What Tokio Marine Aims For in the Future\n\nSee pp. 28-29\n\nBy combining these strengths of diversity and a liberal culture we can create an idea-generating platform that is ideal for innovation. This is why we have made D&I our top-priority growth strategy and are ramping up efforts to put D&I into practice, group-wide and globally. As I always say, there's no such thing as too much communication.\n\nOn the flip side, a group may be diverse and its discussion lively, but the results won't be gratifying unless the members are aiming for the same goal. This is why an inclusive cross-organizational culture that brings diverse people together as a team is so important. As Group Chief Culture Officer (CCO) I used to travel the world, pre-COVID-19, and now interact remotely with our employees in distant locations. Discussing the question 'What is our business for?' helps everyone feel connected to our Group purpose through their work. Human beings are not motivated by logic and authority, nor by directives and orders. The key is to focus their human desire and enthusiasm behind our Purpose. When we are aligned in motivation and purpose then we can soar to new heights, transcending invisible limitations on growth. I am convinced that this creates a force beyond words.\n\nI experienced this when the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 struck 10 years ago. At the time, I headed the Personal Lines Marketing Department for our retail business. Outside-the-box thinking was needed to settle as many claims as possible, as quickly as possible. This led to ideas that weren't in any manual, executed flexibly and energetically at critical moments. Driven by a group-wide sense of unified purpose, we found new solutions which ultimately gave the Group a powerful competitive advantage. I still remember it vividly.\n\nI want the Group to overflow with enthusiasm and team spirit, thereby strengthening bonds of unity and anchoring the Group's purpose which underpins our standards for everything from individual actions to management decisions.\n\nIn this era of discontinuity and disruption in the business environment, enhanced flexibility and resilience are needed to transform our company. At the same time, agility is essential to respond to unpredictable change so that we can sustain strong growth without wavering from our purpose.\n\n## Partnering with customers to prepare for their times of need and to support new endeavors\n\nBy supporting our customers and society under normal conditions we evolve closer to our 'Good Company' vision\n\nExpectations are rising for insurance companies to expand their role as social infrastructure, driven by increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. To stay relevant, we must evolve to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers, leaving the traditional insurance model behind. This means expanding the scope of our value proposition by linking individual product 'points' into 'lines' of services and products, then connecting the lines into an integrated platform 'plane.'\n\nSimply paying out claims for natural disasters and cyber-incidents, for example, is no longer enough to meet customer expectations. Certainly, settling claims is an insurance company's central function and calls for flawless execution. But in the customer's ideal world, accidents wouldn't happen in the first place, and if they did, damage would be minimal and recovery quick.\n\nDigital technology and data analysis will dramatically expand the scope of our value proposition to address such wishes. This will include damage prevention and mitigation for natural disasters, presymptomatic and preventive support for healthcare, as well as\n\ncybersecurity and mobility plans beyond auto.\n\nRecognizing the growing importance of becoming a total solution provider, we will reshape insurance to go beyond claims settlement. This means attending to more concerns and risks, and offering peace of mind that begins before any incident occurs. Through ongoing partnership in normal times, we will be better prepared to support our customers and society in their times of need, as is our corporate purpose. To this end, we launched the Tokio Marine dR platform in July, 2021.\n\nThough the road ahead won't always be smooth, we have faced and overcome many challenges in the past 142 years by correctly identifying the core issues and taking effective measures to address them. Dealing with obstacles is our job and we have a proven history of success. I have full confidence that we will keep moving forward, fueled by enthusiasm, a cheerful attitude, and a shared purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI would like to express once again my deep gratitude to our shareholders, investors, customers and employees for their support, which gives our business life. I promise to continue creating opportunities to engage you in dialogue, and incorporate your valuable opinions and requests to improve our management and refine our business model.\n\nWe are committed to providing value to all stakeholders by tackling social issues and advancing ever closer to our ideal of a 'Good Company' that is viewed as essential and trusted by all. Your support in these endeavors makes all the difference to our company's future and means the world to me, personally.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Maximizing corporate value through a strategic capital policy centered on enterprise risk management\n\n## Takayuki Yuasa\n\nGroup CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Executive Vice President\n\nAs Group CFO, my role is to support the growth of each business by getting deeply involved in the business plans established by each business and executing strategic capital policy. For example, during CFO meetings, where I discuss responses to business environment changes, progress of various strategies and the need for reviews together with the heads of each business, I engage in dialogue to cover major issues of each business and KPI of the new mid-term business plan from the Group CFO's perspective.\n\nSince we are an insurance company, we are increasing returns while taking risks of insurance underwriting and asset management. We have made enterprise risk management (ERM) a fundamental part of Group management. ERM takes into consideration our risk appetite, to what extent we undertake the risks, whether return on risk is sufficient, and whether risk is appropriately diversified. We have also established an ERM Committee for discussing ERM strategy. As chair of this committee, I meet with the Group's C-suite and heads of each business around six times per year to discuss individual risk strategies, the direction of risk appetite, enhancement of ERM, and to look back on initiatives. Based on these talks, I determine a capital allocation plan to ensure the optimal risk portfolio from a Group-wide perspective that will contribute to Tokio Marine's growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the person responsible for Entry & Exit Office rules, I review whether various proposed entry (M&A, etc.) and exit (divestments, etc.) project plans are appropriate and have strategic significance, and then judge whether to go ahead or stop a deal from the perspective of strategic management resources input to ensure appropriate allocation of capital.\n\nOf course, as CFO of a publicly traded company, one of my most important roles is engaging all of you in the capital markets. In addition to investor relations events, in fiscal 2020 I held online dialogue sessions with institutional investors from more than 100 organizations around the world despite the COVID-19 pandemic. I am now working to incorporate these voices into Tokio Marine's capital policy and management strategies to further enhance corporate value.\n\nBased on these many initiatives, we generate capital through the organic growth of each business in Japan and overseas, as well as strategic portfolio assessments. Capital raised is allocated to investment in good companies, but in situations where there are no promising investments, we use it to provide shareholder return. In this manner, we have implemented the capital strategy cycle to enhance corporate value.\n\nI am also responsible for the formulation of our mid-term business plan that seeks out further growth in the future. As such, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss our mid-term business plan from the Group CFO's perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Previous Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nBefore discussing the new three-year mid-term business plan starting in fiscal 2021, first I would like to look back on the results of the previous mid-term business plan that serves as its foundation. During the previous mid-term business plan, we faced the various challenges of natural disasters, COVID-19, social inflation *1 in the United States, and low interest rates around the world. As CFO, through capital allocation and other means, I worked to support the growth strategy of each business, reshuffle our forward-looking portfolio, and assess capital structure.\n\nFor example, in terms of portfolio reshuffling, we made a number of business investments, including the acquisition of PURE Group and Safety Insurance PCL (Safety) in Thailand, integration of Safety with our existing subsidiaries, and establishments a joint venture company in Brazil. On the flip side, we sold off TMR. In this manner, we worked on a number of entry and exit projects while considering risk diversification, optimal capital allocation and future growth.\n\nAs part of my capital structure assessment, the decision was made to issue our first-ever hybrid bonds considering capital\n\ncost *2 at the time of the PURE Group acquisition. While we did not use this before from the standpoint of effective utilization of capital, our capital efficiency has improved to some degree. Therefore, if a large investment opportunity presents itself in the future, or if multiple smaller investment opportunities arise around the same time, we will consider utilizing hybrid bonds as one of the options for achieving the optimal capital structure.\n\nAs a result of these initiatives, our capabilities during the previous mid-term business plan (excluding the transient effects of natural disasters and COVID-19) included adjusted net income of \u00a5431.1 billion (CAGR of 5.0%), adjusted ROE of 12.0%, total dividends of \u00a5139.1 billion (up \u00a521.5 billion), and payout ratio of 42% (up 6pts). As a result, we achieved the targets of the previous mid-term business plan of sustainable profit growth (CAGR of between 3 and 7%), enhance capital efficiency (Adjusted ROE of 10% or higher), and enhancement of shareholder return (increase total dividends and payout ratio).\n\n- *1: An event involving the soaring insurance claim amounts caused by the proactive activities of lawyers and increase in jury verdicts favoring the plaintiff side. *2: Cost required when a company procures capital\n\n## Achievement of the Three Targets of the Previous Mid-Term Business Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n: Actual basis\n\n: Normalized basis\n\n*1: Excluding the impact of COVID-19, natural catastrophes over annual average, and adjusted the market condition (FX and stock price) to the same level as at the end of Mar. 2018. *2: Payout ratio to 5-year average adjusted net income\n\n03",

This will put us in a position to reach our mid- to long-term targets established in 2017 (adjusted net income of over \u00a5500 billion and adjusted ROE of around 12%).\n\nThis KPI is based on organic growth and does not include M&A. Our M&A is to diversify risk only if a promising deal presents itself. Therefore, I don't feel it is appropriate to incorporate the execution of M&A into the plan. In addition to organic growth, if a large and promising M&A opportunity arises, this will make further growth possible and shorten the timeline to reaching our targets.\n\nThe new mid-term business plan was formulated based on discussions not only by the board of directors, but also by CFO meetings and the ERM Committee that I touched upon above. During this process, discussions and reviews first focused on future assessment, including Tokio Marine's future vision, concerning the diversification of customer needs, growing complexity of social issues, low interest rates around the world,\n\ngrowing intensity of natural disasters, and developments in the insurance markets of each country. On top of this, the plan was developed by positioning enhancement of insurance business earnings and initiatives in new markets and growth areas as major growth drivers considering our mid- to long-term targets. Specifically, we will steadily implement our various growth measures, which include improving the profits of fire insurance and expanding specialty insurance in domestic non-life insurance as well as increasing rates and pursuing disciplined underwriting based on market hardening in the overseas insurance business and increasing the profits of the Pure Group acquired in 2020.\n\nSince announcing our new mid-term business plan in May 2021, I have been engaging all of you in the capital markets and received positive responses in terms of the plan's details and probability of reaching its targets. At the same time, I feel some pressure (laughs) as many believe that adjusted net income of \u00a5500 billion should easily be achieved. As CFO, I will contribute to achieving the plan through steady capital strategy execution.",

We will also increase the payout ratio in stages to the same level as global peers (around 50% at present).\n\nOur approach to capital policy remains consistent with before. We will execute M&A for risk diversification if a solid opportunity presents itself and follow through with disciplined shareholder return if there are no M&A deals. Regarding methods to adjust capital level, starting in fiscal 2021 we have allocated at least \uffe5 100 billion per year to both small and mid-sized growth investments and shareholder return from the perspective of further increasing transparency. Moreover, we will introduce a more agile approach to determining shareholder return, taking into account the M&A pipeline and share value, instead of the typical twice a year.\n\n## Trends in Shareholder Return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trends in ROE\n\nAs a result of these initiatives, our adjusted ROE has been trending above a capital cost of 7%, which is calculated based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)*, since 2013.

This line continued to grow in fiscal 2020 despite COVID-19, placing us atop the industry in terms of top line performance and year on year growth rate. Moreover, with a sound combined ratio, the line continues to generate stable earnings.\n\n## Limited Impacts from Environmental Changes Such as  Autonomous  Driving Technologies\n\nGoing forward, the automobile insurance market is expected to see progress in autonomous driving technologies, a declining number of automobiles on the road in Japan following the country's changing demographics, and the spread of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nHowever, considerable time is still needed until the complete adoption of autonomous driving technologies, and since this will increase the insurance premium unit price, we believe the impacts on claim cost will be limited (for details, see page 53).\n\nWhile the number of automobiles will decline, quantitatively speaking, the CAGR of vehicle ownership is expected to be around -0.4% *4 from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2030, meaning any impacts should not be substantial. Furthermore, the spread of EVs will not necessarily lead to market contraction because of rising insurance premium unit prices and the possibility of unique risks associated with EVs.\n\n## Continuing to Generate Stable Profits by Introducing a Number of High-Value-Added Products\n\nTokio Marine became the first in the Japan's insurance industry to provide customers with a dual-camera driving recorder in April 2021 and we are currently seeing policy growth with this product. We will continue to roll out similar high-value-added products and provide them to customers, while thoroughly utilizing digital technologies, to sustainably expand market share. Additionally, we will continue to generate stable profits going forward by addressing new risks emerging from the progress of autonomous driving technologies and spread of EVs and responding to new needs associated with the growing complexity of liability.\n\n## /uni25A0 Top line *1 (billions of JPY)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /uni25A0 Combined Ratio *3 (Private insurance E/I basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2010\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n- *1: Net premiums written\n- *2: Direct net premiums written\n- Source: Insurance Statistics (Sonpo Toukeigo) Vol.4864\n- *3: C/R = E/I loss ratio + W/P expense ratio\n- *4: Calculated by the Company based on Automobile Dealers Vision (fiscal 2019)\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n## Reference: Impacts on automobile insurance market due to advancements in autonomous driving technologies\n\nImpacts from advancements in autonomous driving technologies are limited for the time being, but over the long term there are growing expectations in insurance companies as a form of social infrastructure underpinned by advancements in automobiles and growing complexity of liability.\n\n## Impacts from Advancements in Autonomous Driving Technologies\n\nAutonomous driving technologies are making moderate progress, as symbolized by the release of the Honda Legend featuring the world's first Level 3 self-driving tech in March 2021 (the Government of Japan's targets appear at right). The insurance industry is expected to be impacted by declining accident frequency and growing complexity of accident liability as a result of such progress in technology.\n\n## Impacts from Declining Accident Frequency\n\nProgress of autonomous driving technologies will indeed help reduce the frequency of accidents, but the impacts on the insurance industry are expected to be limited for the time being for the following reasons.\n\n- \u00b7 Vehicles have various replacement cycles and it takes more than 15 years until all vehicles on the market are replaced with new ones *3 . Furthermore, even if a Level 4 automobile came to market, autonomous driving will only be limited to expressways (accounting for around 3% of accidents). This suggests that the decline in accident frequency will only be moderate.\n- \u00b7 In terms of claim cost, although accident frequency will decline moderately, repair costs are expected to increase because of the high cost of EV parts. Therefore, any impacts will be limited for the time being.\n- \u00b7 Moreover, responding to the new risks emerging from technological progress (cyber risk, etc.) can become an opportunity for the insurance industry.\n\nFurthermore, a research working group of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism *4 concluded that it is appropriate for drivers to remain the primary party of liability up to Level 4 self-driving. As a result, today's automobile insurance will remain relevant.\n\n## Impacts from Growing Complexity of Accident Liability\n\nThere is concern about the growing complexity of accident liability in the event of accidents caused by autonomous vehicles because in addition to the at-fault party and no-fault party, claims for damages could also be brought against manufacturers or software companies. We are launching products ahead of competitors that ensure victims are quickly compensated in contributing to the realization of a safe and secure automotive lifestyle even in the current environment.\n\n## /uni25A0 Progress in Autonomous Driving Technology\n\n## Driver Government Target (private vehicles) Level of Autonomous Driving\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /uni25A0 No significant changes to claims cost for the time being\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /uni25A0 Support for saving victims (Japan's first)\n\nApril 2017: Launched coverage riders for expenses for saving victims April 2021: Auto accidents during autonomous driving have no impact on the grade rating system for non-fleet auto insurance\n\n- *1: Based on our data, insurance payment for expressway accidents comprise about 3% of all accidents\n- *2: Based on MLIT Survey on Penetration of ASV Technology, Dec. 2020\n- *3: Public-Private ITS Initiative / Roadmaps 2020.\n- *4: Mar. 2018, MLIT Research Group on Liability for Accident Compensation concerning Autonomous Driving",

In addition to the major worldwide social issues of the transition to renewable energy and growing cyber risk, Japan, too, faces the issues of an aging population and the decline of regional economies, which are becoming more serious. This has resulted in ever-higher expectations being placed on insurance companies as a form of social infrastructure.\n\n## Unlocking Robust Growth through Resolutions to Issues to Grow the Line into the Next Pillar after Automobile Insurance\n\nAs a company that has grown sustainably through its solutions to social issues, we perceive these environmental changes as an opportunity to seize. For example, the insurance enrollment rate of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) believed to account for over 99% of Japanese companies is low, making it a major untapped market. We hope to deliver high-value-added products that meet all needs of these SMEs to every corner of Japan through increased collaboration with commerce and industry associations and local governments along with the utilization of digitalization. Our goal is to increase our brand recognition to the point where SMEs recognize Tokio Marine's unique value proposition.\n\nFurthermore, automobile insurance is expected to decline over the next 20 to 30 years, but specialty insurance will take its place with robust growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /uni25A0 Transform business line portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /uni25A0 Creation of new markets\n\n| Priority Areas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Initiatives    | Three-year Revenue Growth Plan   | Reference   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| \u00b7 Respond to higher health awareness and the need for balancing treatment (nursing care) and work \u00b7 Increase revenue for wide area public sector/corporate workplace with new sales model and  digital application procedures                               | +\u00a520-30bn *4   | PP. 82-83                        | Health care |\n| SME \u00b7 Current market size of about \u00a5400bn *5 \u00b7 Premiums *6  increased more than fourfold in 10 years \u00b7 Increase revenue by strengthening alliance with commerce and industry associations and  improving product appeal                                     | +\u00a515-25bn *4   | -                                |             |\n| \u00b7 Global market size in 2030: \u00a5200bn \u00b7 Establish 'GX *7  Office' in June 2021 \u00b7 Increase revenue by enhance Group-based initiatives including utilization of the abundant  expertise of GCube Offshore wind                                                 | Around+\u00a55bn *4 |                                  | PP. 78-79   |\n| \u00b7 Current market size of about \u00a5180bn (according to research firm) \u00b7 Double digit increase in our premiums each fiscal year \u00b7 Increase revenue by capturing stronger risk awareness and revised Personal Information  Protection Law (2022) Cyber insurance | Around+\u00a55bn *4 | PP. 80-81                        |             |\n| Other New risks, etc. \u00b7 Increase revenue with coverage for various new risks including M&A, local government related  area, etc.  \u00b7 Create new market by leveraging on the strength of core data company Tokio Marine dR to be  launched in July 2021       | +\u00a520-30bn *4   | PP. 28-29                        |             |\n\n- *1: Direct net premiums written, including P.A.   *2: Temporary rise in C/R due to specific contract   *3: Net premiums written, including P.A. for specialty\n- *4: Net premiums written during 3 year new MTP period   *5: Estimated from public data and actual sales of our packaged products for SMEs\n- *6: Our packaged product for SMEs  *7: Green Transformation\n\n## Domestic Non-Life Insurance\n\n## Improving Fire Insurance Earnings\n\nWe will build a sustainable fire insurance system while contributing to a society that is resilient to disasters by implementing a number of countermeasures comprehensively.

Tokio Marine believes that it is even more important to provide value that goes beyond the payment of claims to deliver peace of mind before and after an event. This includes preventing accidents, mitigating customers' burden in the event of an accident, helping early restoration and preventing recurrences.\n\nToward that end, we will utilize digitalization and data in a sophisticated manner. Specifically, we will hire a team of experts in digitalization at Tokio Marine dR Co., Ltd., our core data company established in July 2021. This will allow us to speed up initiatives and tackle new challenges so that we can support customers in their time of need and evolve into a company that always supports its customers.\n\n(Before event) Disaster\n\nprevention/reduction\n\nSpeedy insurance\n\npayout\n\n(After event) Early recovery from disaster\n\n## (Before event) Flooding risk projection system\n\nVisualize at-risk area with real time flooding area projection to support local government decision making at time of heavy rains.

The time created will allow us to turn our attention to top-line expansion through resolving new social issues, which will lead to our sustainable growth.\n\nSince launching its Business Process Reform Project 13 years ago, Tokio Marine has reduced internal admin by around 30%. This has allowed us to shift freed up personnel to sales, driving the sustained growth of our market share.\n\nThe initiatives indicated below represent a company-wide project launched in fiscal 2020 by TMNF. Over the next three years, we will commit \u00a540 billion mainly to digitalization investments to thoroughly reduce internal admin (our goal is to reduce workload by 15% at the end of fiscal 2023 and by 20 to 30% at the end of fiscal 2026). The time created from these efforts does not mean we will reduce personnel; rather, we will turn our attention to top-line\n\ngrowth through resolving new social issues, improving the loss rate, and supporting human resources development, which will lead to our sustainable growth without diminishing the equilibrium.\n\nSpecifically, sales departments will thoroughly reduce internal admin such as response to inquiries, policy management, and accounting and use the capacity freed up to focus on top-line growth mainly in specialty insurance. Claims departments, too, will digitalize all processes to thoroughly reduce admin and use this time instead to enhance our provision of peace of mind before and after events.\n\n## Initiatives to improve business efficiency\n\nBusiness expenses (sales departments)\n\n## Sales activity, etc.\n\nInquiries\n\nPolicy management / reporting\n\nOther internal administration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Digital contact points with customers\n- \u00b7 Automated/efficient response to inquiries / internal administration\n- \u00b7 Expand coverage areas for Group companies\n- \u00b7 New agency system\n\nLoss adjustment expenses (claims departments)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey profitability improvement Initiatives\n\nProfitability improvement of fire (please see page 55)\n\n## Expected effects\n\n\u00b7 Reduce internal administration Improve expense ratio / loss ratio\n\n## Effects of reduced internal\n\nadministration FY2023 -15% (Equivalent to \u00a520-25bn p.a.)

This is because the conservativeness of financial accounting *1 results in a structure where the accounting expense burden is high in the first fiscal year of policies and profits are depressed because of new policy underwriting.

Flatten from FY2030.\n\nover the long term we will break through the \u00a5100 billion mark in profits. In this manner, the domestic life insurance business, which underwrites risk with a low correlation to non-life insurance, will contribute to Tokio Marine's risk diversification and act as a driver for long-term growth.\n\nTo achieve the new MTP along with long-term risk diversification and profit growth, Domestic Life Insurance will work to (1) expand sales scale and (2) improve profitability and accelerate profit contribution.\n\n03",

We will continue to deploy this win-win strategy.\n\n## (1) Expand sales scale\n\nThe categories of life and non-life are profit centers for insurance companies and\n\nrepresent the only types of insurance that protect customers in times of need. Consequently, we will safeguard customers from all forms of risk by providing seamless protection using the integrated business model for life and non-life exemplified by our integrated life and non-life insurance product, Super Insurance. Through this world first initiative, not only we have boosted the cross-selling rate, but we are also further increasing this rate by developing unique customer-oriented products.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched Medical Kit Yell, a new medical insurance for seniors with relaxed underwriting criteria. We increased the cross-selling rate and reached around 50,000 policies in the first eight months following its launch, which also marked the highest sales scale in the insurance industry.\n\nUnder the new MTP, we will focus on the growth areas of seniors, healthcare, and asset formulation and bring peace of mind to a larger number of customers by speeding up cross-selling using the customer base of TMNF.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (2) Improve profitability and accelerate profit contribution\n\nTMNL was established in 1996 as an antithesis to conventional life insurance where people change their lives to suit life insurance. TMNL was the first to focus on risks during life, such as treatment after hospitalization, inability to work, and nursing care, which are not covered by conventional life insurance, releasing a number of innovative protection-type products. This gives us the track record and pride that has continued to drive our success in the living protection field.\n\nUnder the new MTP, we will further increase product appeal and mainly introduce products with high profitability that make early profit contribution to accelerate growth while directly contributing to the resolution of social issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: 35% or higher for TNP / TQ agents\n- *2: IRR indicates profitability as expected returns on expenses for the entire insurance period on financial accounting basis (FY2016 for long-term savings-type products, FY2020 for others)\n- *3: Time required for cumulative profits on financial accounting basis to turn positive\n- Size of the bubble indicates new policies ANP for the product (FY2020, FY2021 projection for (4))\n- *4: Includes household income protection with death benefit\n- /uni25A0 Super Insurance: Ratio of the number of policies with either life or third sector (cross-sell rate) 30% + *1\n\nInternational Insurance (Developed Markets Strategy)\n\n## Achieving stable and high profitability centered on specialty insurance\n\nThrough the three major initiatives of increasing underwriting profit, driving growth for PURE, and continued bolt-on M&A, we will achieve profit growth with a CAGR of approximately +6%.\n\n## While maintaining the top class position we have established, we are aiming for further growth under the new MTP.\n\nWe have formed a well-diversified portfolio and have recorded stable and high profits mainly by providing a wide range of products to corporations in developed countries. This has allowed us to establish a top 10 position in commercial lines in the U.S. market, as well as a top class position in the specialty insurance field and at U.K.-based Lloyd's. To further increase profit growth, we are engaging in the following three initiatives.\n\n## (1) Increasing underwriting profit\n\nThe market is continuing to harden, with a rise in premium rates due to the increasing frequency of natural catastrophes, the low interest rate environment, the impact of COVID-19, and an increase in loss cost caused by factors such as social inflation. Although it would not be too difficult to simply grow our top line in this environment, we are not pursuing short-term top-line growth. Focusing on the bottom line, we are harnessing our strength in underwriting and risk underwriting to reduce future reserve risk while accurately ascertaining the increase in loss cost and the profitability of each business line via a forward-looking approach. In addition, through working to further increase operational efficiency, we aim to drive sustainable profit growth while continuing to maintain high profitability in a stable manner.\n\nQuantitatively, during the new mid-term business plan (MTP) period we aim to boost underwriting profit by generating robust growth in the top line with a CAGR of approximately +5% while maintaining a combined ratio (C/R) that compares well to our global peers of approximately 93% (fiscal 2020: 93.3%, barring unforeseen circumstances).\n\n## Main measures\n\n## Maintain strict underwriting discipline\n\n## Premium rates increases\n\n- \u00b7 Improved the quality of portfolio during the previous MTP period through rigorous efforts to reduce unprofitable business lines\n- \u00b7 Continue to build a strong underwriting portfolio while paying close attention to trends in profitability in light of issues such as rising social inflation\n\n## New risk-taking\n\n## Improve operational efficiency\n\n- \u00b7 While ascertaining profitability, engage in new risk-taking in lines where high returns are expected thanks to the hardening market\n- \u00b7 Improve administrative processes and work to reduce the expense ratio at each Group company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Aspiration (Maintain a C/R of approx. 93% and achieve a CAGR of approx. +5%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2: North America + Europe segments.

That is why we have in-depth knowledge of their business and relationships of trust with the management of target companies. In addition, we have made steady progress with post-merger integration (PMI) based on our wealth of experience and robust framework. That leads to a high rate of success in our M&A deals.

TMHCC has utilized key persons of acquired companies, resulting in many people playing broader more motivating role in important posts in specialty areas and reinsurance, among others not only within TMHCC but also now across the entire Tokio Marine Group (please see pages 24-25).\n\nSecond is the rollout of knowledge across the Group. Our knowledge of bolt-on M&A is widely shared with other Group companies through global meetings and other means. This process is now standardized by Tokio Marine Holdings and applied at other Group companies as a guideline. I believe this contributes to the improved quality of bolt-on M&A deals across the entire Group, along with risk diversification and profit growth.\n\nGoing forward, we hope to use bolt-on M&A to contribute to the further growth of the entire Group as one of our strengths.",

Although there are various countries comprising these emerging countries and it is essential to strategically develop our business in light of each of their situations, as a result of our efforts, we have achieved top-line growth that outperforms the market. Also, we have expanded the scale of our bottom line in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncountries such as Brazil and Thailand from a few billion yen to \u00a510 billion. Under the new mid-term business plan (MTP), we aim to contribute to greater profit and implement various growth strategies in order to build more pillars of future growth.\n\nThe information below highlights Brazil and India, which are profit drivers for the new MTP.\n\n## Brazil: Establish JV with Caixa Bank and accelerate growth\n\nUnder their CEO who has a background in IT, Brazil-based TMSR has improved profitability for their key product line of automobile insurance through efficient operations that utilize digital technology, developing a system with high usability for brokers, and improving their ability to respond to customers. As a result, they have achieved profit growth with a CAGR of over +30% since fiscal 2018, and have already generated profit of \u00a510 billion level. In addition to this strong existing business, with the aim of diversifying our portfolio and achieving further growth, we established a joint venture (JV) with Caixa Bank, which is Brazil's\n\nlargest banking group and has a roughly 70% share in mortgage market. The JV commenced operations in February 2021 and primarily provides mortgage insurance *1 and homeowners' insurance. Thanks to the strong mortgage market in Brazil, the JV made a strong start; its operations began without delay and plans were upwardly revised. Going forward, we aim to increase our after-tax profit by approximately \u00a56.5 billion *2 by fiscal 2025 through expanding sales for home insurance, which is expected to generate high profitability.\n\n## /uni25A0 TMSR after-tax profit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*3: Exchange rate as of end of Mar. 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## India: Further utilize IFFCO's network and Group know-how\n\nIn India, we are providing automobile insurance, medical insurance, and agriculture insurance, by utilizing a network of 36,000 branches operated across India by our partner IFFCO. Going forward, we will further expand sales for rural areas where growth among the middle class is expected, and while maintaining an industry-leading expense ratio and level of productivity, we will harness our know-how in underwriting and digital technology with the aim of making approximately \u00a54.5 billion in after-tax profit in fiscal 2023, doubling the amount reached in fiscal 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: An insurance product that combines credit life insurance and home insurance for the purpose of compensating a lender in the event that the borrower cannot repay their home loan.\n- *2: Exchange rate at time of publication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*4: Source: Brazilian insurance regulator SUSEP\n\n## Reference: Further expansion of mortgage market in Brazil\n\nCirca 25 million of housing demand is expected based on new housing demand of 16.9 million by 2040 as well as current housing gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*5: Source: General Insurance Council, IRDAI\n\n## Asset Management\n\n## Increasing income by leveraging our strength in credit management even within the low interest rate environment\n\nGiven the anticipated lengthening of the low interest rate environment, we will increase investment income utilizing the ability to spot good investment targets in the credit market\n\n## Expanding Disciplined Credit Management in the United States\n\nTokio Marine's asset management policy focuses on increasing long-term and stable investment income based on the characteristics of insurance liabilities. In particular, we will utilize Delphi's asset management prowess to invest funds from Group companies inside and outside of Japan mainly into credit assets in the United States, and we achieve high returns while conducting appropriate monitoring and risk control. This integrated asset management style combining Japan and the United States marks Tokio Marine's strength. Under the new MTP, credit management in\n\nthe United States forms a key point of our investment income. Low interest rates continue to prevail around the world. For this reason, we believe that the decline in income yield is inevitable to some degree. Nevertheless, we aim to increase assets under management (AUM) following the growth in insurance underwriting and enhance investment income while controlling credit risk appropriately within our Group-wide ERM framework and utilizing the ability to spot good investment opportunities of DFG, which excels at credit management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: Assets of U.S. 5 major GCs (DFG, PHLY, FICOH, TMAIC, TMHCC) + Assets entrusted by domestic 3 GCs.\n\n## Reference: Strengths of DFG's Investment Team\n\nDFG is firmly taking earnings opportunities by shifting the portfolio nimbly based on economic phases, utilizing its advanced expertise, in-depth experience, and information collection and analysis capabilities using our broad network. In addition, the insurance liabilities that underpin investment are backed by a stable, long-term cash flow derived from products such as insurance for employee benefits and excess workers'\n\ncompensation. Therefore, DFG can hold investment assets to redemption without worrying about short-term market turbulence. As a result of this investment style, it continues to generate high returns versus indexes.\n\nMoreover, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, DFG will identify information on promising opportunities and execute investments at attractive prices with a sense of speed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2: Measures excess return per unit of risk.

To flexibly address and resolve the increasingly complex social issues of today, it is crucial to develop a workplace environment that fully harnesses the strengths of the Group's workforce of more than 40,000 employees. As CHRO of a 'Good Company' that protects customers in their times of need, I am particularly focused on hiring diverse personnel, training them in a systematic manner, and creating mechanisms to support this process, both inside and outside of Japan.\n\nAs one example, we hold discussions about our diverse worldwide workforce and we are expanding cross-border training programs to develop our global management talent. For instance, on the Global Executive Program, senior leaders from around the world eat and sleep together under extreme conditions, which built a strong relationship of trust among the participants, and led to further synergies across the Group.\n\nSustainable growth requires supporting the diverse values and flexible working styles of employees and encouraging them to tackle new challenges, so it is essential to rethink our HR systems and operations and further develop our remote work infrastructure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, up to 70 percent of companies in Japan and nearly 100 percent of companies in North America and South America had their employees work from home at some point. Experiencing remote work, employees around the world have had the chance to think about their style and increase their productivity. Tokio Marine is now developing systems to enable their productive and diverse working styles.\n\nFor example, at TMNF we introduced the 'Super My Select' System, where employees have flexible working hours to accommodate diverse working styles and increase motivation, and the Project Request System, where employees nationwide can apply to take part in projects for corporate departments at the headquarters in parallel with their regular positions. In order to realize sustainable growth of both employees and the company, Tokio Marine is eliciting employees' ideas and enabling them to play a greater role even if they have childcare or nursing care obligations, while eliminating the constraints of place and time wherever possible.\n\nAt Tokio Marine our core identity -'To Be a Good Company'unites our highly diverse people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to strengthen this core identity. Meetings called 'Majikirakai' (where employees can talk about serious matters in a casual setting) are held remotely to foster open and free discussions among our employees around the world on how to be a Good Company.\n\nOf course, our workplaces must be environments where employees can work and remain physically and mentally healthy. In my other position as CWO of the Group, I am working on health and productivity management, while CDIO Mika Nabeshima, who was appointed in April, is taking the lead in promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\nThese are but a fraction of our people-related initiatives. We will continue to elevate our talent and increase the Group's collective strengths to protect our customers in their times of need over the next century as a Good Company.\n\nExperiential Learning at sea on the Global Executive Program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pursuing the Optimal Human Resources Portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasing Employee Engagement\n\n## Promoting Highly Productive and Diverse Working Styles\n\n## Promoting Diversity and Inclusion\n\nPromoting Health and Productivity Management\n\nVisiting a disaster area at MGL\n\nCEO Komiya's remote 'world tour' (CEO meetings) CEO personally working to reinforce our core identity\n\n## New HR System at Tokio Marine Holdings\n\nFrom fiscal 2019, Tokio Marine Holdings implemented an HR system aimed at acquiring top talent and fostering global management personnel.

We are committed to implementing our diversity and inclusion strategy to ensure Tokio Marine Group's continued growth.\n\n## Mika Nabeshima\n\nExecutive Officer Group Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion as a core management strategy and a key to our competitiveness\n\nOver the past two decades Tokio Marine has made great strides in diversifying its human resources, regional and business portfolios through proactive global expansion. We have grown by building inclusive workplaces where employees respect one another and incorporate the ideas and perspectives of newly acquired employees and businesses. On the other hand, social issues are becoming more complex, uncertainty is rising, and the world is facing an increasing number of risks. Tokio Marine recognizes that further promoting diversity and inclusion is essential to addressing the growing breadth of social issues and the needs of customers, both of which will diversify in the future. We view diversity and inclusion as a core management strategy, and we established the Diversity Council and the position of Group Diversity & Inclusion Officer (CDIO) in April 2021. As CDIO I am dedicated to promoting and instilling diversity and inclusion from various angles, including closing the gender gap and leveraging our global talent pool.\n\nFirst, in terms of closing the gender gap, women are already playing an active role in various positions at Tokio Marine. Over 30 percent of leadership positions globally across the Group are held by women and we are working on further initiatives tailored to the unique challenges of each Group company. TMNF, our core company in Japan, has focused on closing the gender gap as part of its growth strategy. We are focusing our efforts on fostering female leaders and expanding their opportunities in order to have women participate in all decision making processes. We created an action plan under the Act on Promotion of Women's Participation and Advancement in the Workplace with a target of having women in 50 percent of leadership pipeline positions by fiscal 2023 and reached it ahead of schedule. We are now redoubling our efforts toward a new target of having women in 30 percent of leadership positions by\n\nfiscal 2030. Additionally, in April 2019, we established the Tokio Marine Group Women's Career College to help women develop their own career vision and leadership skills so they are confident to take on even more active roles and greater responsibility at the company. The college added an advanced program in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, each workplace is seriously working on a daily basis to develop and engage female leaders, in order to further drive the Group's growth.\n\nNext, on leveraging our global talent, we believe that matching our Group's diverse talent with the right assignments will help to resolve emerging issues and produce growth. For instance, Caryn Angelson, CHRO and CLO at TMNAS, a Group company in the United States, also has a role in HR at Tokio Marine Holdings. She works closely with me on our global strategy for talent management, diversity & inclusion, and learning & development, while playing a key role in the global HR community. She also serves as an instructor for our diversity and inclusion leadership training program for the Group. In addition to Caryn, global talent with functional expertise participate in our global committees, such as the ERM Committee, International Executive Committee, and Global Retention Strategy Committee. Their wisdom is helping resolve global management issues for the Group.\n\nThe examples here are only a few of our initiatives. We are dedicated to promoting the Group's diversity and inclusion strategy to fully engage the skills of our diverse talent around the world. This will enable us to provide greater safety and security to our customers globally, contribute to sustainable growth for the Group, and continue to provide value to all of our stakeholders.\n\nMiddle Global Leadership Development Program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTokio Marine Group Women's Career College\n\n## Diversity Policy\n\nTokio Marine Group believes the power of its people is the driving force for realizing its vision of be a 'Good Company.'\n\nFor the insurance business, which is said to be a 'people's business,' the people involved and the trust they create are the source of our competitive advantage.

Despite the pandemic, we maintained our insurance business functions as a part of social infrastructure by responding to customers while adopting remote work and striving to ensure the safety of employees and stop the spread of infections.\n\nAlso, from well before the start of typhoon season, we ran simulations to ensure we could sustain our operations even if multiple\n\n## Customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contactless customer service\n\n- \u00b7 Remote customer service by expanding smartphone apps and web conferencing system, etc.\n- \u00b7 Free online health consultations\n\n## COVID-19 insurance claims over \u00a5100 billion*\n\n- \u00b7 Payouts mainly entailed event cancellations and business interruption insurance overseas\n- *: Estimate of insurance claims related to COVID-19\n\n## Shareholders\n\n## Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 10 consecutive years of higher dividends (projected) amid increasing capabilities\n\n## Ensuring the safety of employees and their families\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net income in fiscal 2020 accounting for the impacts of the COVID-19 totaled \u00a5431.1 billion and adjusted ROE was 12.0%, achieving the targets set out in the previous MTP on a real basis\n- \u00b7 The payout ratio for fiscal 2020 was 42% (35% or higher in previous MTP)\n- \u00b7 Up to 70% of employees in Japan and 100% overseas worked from home\n- \u00b7 Handed out masks in Japan and adopted flexible working hours\n\nRan business continuity simulations in case of a large-scale natural disaster\n\nlarge-scale natural disasters struck during the pandemic, based on the recognition that an earthquake could strike Japan anywhere and at anytime.

Tokio Marine launched the Post-COVID-19 Task Force including outside experts in July 2020 in order to once again review and examine the Group's medium- to long-term strategies in a post-COVID-19 world. The review process involved top management from our overseas subsidiaries, leading to discussions involving representatives across the Group.\n\nThe figure below presents the results of these discussions. The challenges before and after the pandemic have not necessarily changed all that much. However, we believe that we will need to further accelerate or upgrade our previous initiatives.\n\nThe key is taking core actions and execution. For example, in\n\n## Changes and challenges post COVID-19\n\n- 1. Continuation of operations during an emergency\n- 2. Priority placed on the safety of the lives and health of individuals\n- 3. Agents mainly offering insurance products face to face will find it harder to capture clients\n- 4. Accelerated use of data / digitalization to offer high-quality, non-face-to-face customer experience\n- 5. Increasing needs to improve cost efficiency in response to growing cost awareness from clients\n- 6. Accumulation control of pandemic risk\n\ncalculating probable maximum loss (PML) for pandemic risks, although we previously estimated the risk amount mainly related to life insurance, in fiscal 2020 we updated risk measurement methods regarding non-life-insurance lines in fiscal 2020 taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this way, we are working to further accelerate or upgrade our previous initiatives from various angles and we have already embedded this into the strategies of each company.\n\nIn addition, through Group-wide cross-functional discussions, we found there to be room for generating further synergies, which served as an opportunity to foster greater collaboration between related parties. We are fully prepared for the next stage of our growth in the post-COVID-19 world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Our understanding                                    | Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Existing  initiatives  will be  further  accelerated | 1.

Later, the Group helped the country shift to automobile travel in the post-war period by providing auto insurance. More recently, with the acquisition of GCube, a leading insurance underwriter in the renewable energy sector, the Group has been supporting the shift to renewable energy with insurance. Through its mainstay insurance business, the Group has grown sustainably by promptly providing beneficial solutions for the changing challenges of every era.\n\nIn these ways, the Tokio Marine Group has been addressing societal issues throughout its long history. Such issues have changed over the generations, but the Group's commitment has never changed. For the Tokio Marine Group, sustainability strategies are about promoting solutions for these issues through business activities while contributing to the sustainability of society. This approach has been at the core of its corporate culture since it was founded.\n\nAcross its global operations, the Group will continue working to benefit society, bring happiness to people, and protect the environment in order to help build a sustainable planet and, consequently, provide even more social value and economic value (in the form of profit growth). Through these efforts, the Group will aim to be a 'Good Company' over the next century by delivering value to all of its stakeholders.\n\n## History of the Group's Growth and Solutions for Societal Issues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*1: Excludes deposit premiums from policyholders  *2: Shows premiums from Tokio Marine from fiscal 2001 and prior, and combined premiums from Tokio Marine & Nichido and Nisshin Fire, etc. from fiscal 2002 onward  *3: Shows premiums from 2002 onward when Tokio Marine Holdings was established  *4: Does not include one-time dividends provided as capital level adjustment\n\n## Organizational Structure for Promoting Sustainability\n\nAmid major changes in the operating environment, predicting trends just two or three years into the future has become practically impossible. Indeed, the Company recognizes that an age of discontinuity has begun, in which common sense and past successes do not necessarily apply anymore. Because this brings major challenges, the Company has returned to its original purpose and stepped up its efforts to solve issues confronting society today.\n\nFor these reasons, in April 2021, the Company appointed a group chief sustainability officer (CSUO) and established its\n\nSustainability Committee, which is made up of the chief executive officer and other C-suite. The committee has been reviewing the latest important areas of concern, concrete initiatives, goals, and other related matters (please see pages 72-77), and C-suite have accelerated group-wide initiatives in the areas for which they are each responsible.\n\nBased on discussions with the committee and in management meetings, the Board of Directors will decide on and evaluate sustainability strategies going forward.\n\n## Organizational Structure for Promoting Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Makes proposals related to grooming female executive candidates, making companies more inclusive, and improving diversity- and inclusion-related indices (please see pages 66-67)\n\n## (1) Role of the Sustainability Committee\n\n- \u00b7 Deliberates on the Tokio Marine Group's sustainability strategies\n- \u00b7 Oversees the overall management and execution of sustainability strategies\n- \u00b7 Reports to and submits matters for discussions to the Board of Directors and in relevant management meetings\n\nMatters discussed by the Sustainability Committee\n\nMay 6, 2021:  Formulation of sustainability strategies, systems for executing the strategies, and key issues in important areas\n\nJuly 6, 2021:\n\nImplications of external trends for the Group, and annual plans for organizations that will carry out initiatives and top priority policies\n\n## (2) Roles of other organizations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Secretarial Office: Handles administration for the committee (as well as the subcommittees and task force) and promotes the sustainability strategies\n- Working Groups: Formulates and executes annual plans for each type of issue, with input from relevant departments of Tokio Marine Holdings and members of group companies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Task force: Organizes members of projects tasked with strengthening short-term initiatives\n\n04",

However, its material issues and related matters have been revised in a meeting of Tokio Marine Holdings' Board of Directors based on deliberations by its Sustainability Committee, which was established in April 2021. Accordingly, relevant measures have been specified based on the potential impact of risks and opportunities on the Group's businesses. Besides mitigating risks and capitalizing on opportunities, the Group will strive to turn risks into opportunities and provide solutions to social issues as a means to bring value to society as well as economic value in the form of profit growth.\n\n## Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What\n\nImportant business matters\n\nMaterial issues\n\nHow\n\nRisks and opportunities\n\nValue creation\n\nDetails of the Eight Material Issues, Including the Four Priority Issues (Why, What)\n\n## Future generations included as stakeholders in April 2021\n\nThe Group added future generations to the four categories of stakeholders it had previously specified as those it must provide value to.\n\n| Stakeholders                   | Value provided                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| For customers                  | \u00b7 Contribute to making customers' lives healthy and enriching through products that  provide security and assistance with future-oriented challenges                                           |\n| For society                    | \u00b7 Contribute to building a sustainable society that can overcome any challenge and  ensure the safety and security of all its members                                                          |\n| For future generations         | \u00b7 Hand down a sustainable environment to future generations                                                                                                                                    |\n| For employees                  | \u00b7 Help employees reach their highest potential through engagement and  opportunities for them to thrive                                                                                        |\n| For shareholders and investors | \u00b7 Continually increase shareholder returns \u00b7 Enhance the Group's value and earn the trust of shareholders and investors through  timely and proper disclosure along with constructive dialogue |\n\n## Social issues increased from five to seven to connect with future generations (please see pages 30-31)\n\nIn addition to increasing its stakeholder categories, the Group increased the social issues it must address from five to seven after considering recent changes in the environment and growing interest in such issues.

The Tokio Marine Group recognizes the importance of  addressing climate change and natural disasters because it underwrites risks in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| (2) Improve disaster resilience (priority)                  | Japan, a country especially prone to natural disasters.

With the aging of the population and widespread advancements in  medicine, however, the financial burden on individuals, families, and society is  growing each year. The Tokio Marine Group intends to address this issue by fully  utilizing its extensive expertise to offer high-value-added products and services while  covering disease and illness through its many life and non-life insurance products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| (4) Promote and support diversity and inclusion (priority)  | Amid major changes in the economic environment, social issues are becoming  increasingly complex and diverse. For the Tokio Marine Group to grow sustainably by  offering solutions to such issues, it will be important for its more than 40,000  employees to maximize their potential and combine their individual skills into  collective capabilities. Accordingly, promoting and supporting diversity and inclusion  is an important management strategy for the Group, and it intends to step up the  initiatives it has been carrying out for this purpose.                                                                                                                        |\n| (5) Facilitate and foster innovation through digitalization | Rapid progress in technological innovations are driving major societal and economic  changes. To realize sustainable economic growth under those circumstances, all  corporations will need to create a basis for technological innovation. The Tokio Marine  Group is already providing insurance coverage for new types of risks that have arisen  from these changes, including cyber risk. Furthermore, in addition to insurance  payouts, the Group will apply digital technologies and data to provide security to  clients before and after any events that may require insurance claims. In these ways,  the Group will work to support corporate growth and economic development. |\n| (6) Protect the natural environment                         | The Tokio Marine Group understands that a sustainable society, in which everyone  can live safely and securely and pursue any aspiration, depends on the natural  environment, the basis for all life and people's livelihoods. Moreover, the Group  recognizes its obligation to help ensure that future generations inherit a sustainable  natural environment, as it is irreplaceable. Based on these principles, the Group  intends to bolster the initiatives it has taken to combat climate change and protect  biodiversity and wetlands through environmental conservation activities, including its  Green Gift project and mangrove planting activities.                         |\n| (7) Provide education to children                           | Education can create a foundation for the future, as each generation faces the  changing challenges of the times. Having specified future generations of people as  stakeholders, the Tokio Marine Group has a duty to help equip children with the skills  they will need in life. Therefore, the Group plans to strengthen its educational  programs, including its Disaster Risk Prevention Lessons for children, which were  initiated following the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| (8) Disclose highly transparent and timely information      | As an original participant in the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD), the Tokio Marine Group is working to properly disclose information and  facilitate widespread climate-related disclosure.

In major countries of the world, including the US, China, India, and European countries, the cost of generating electricity from renewable energy sources is expected to become cheaper than from fossil fuels (LNG and coal) before 2030 as a result of advances in power generation technologies. Against this backdrop, a decarbonization movement has been spreading globally and major countries are shifting to efficiently generated renewable energy. Based on these factors, renewable energy is projected to account for over 50% of the world's total energy supply by 2035 and 73% by 2050. Accordingly, the supply of renewable energy is projected to grow by around over 6% annually on average between 2020 and 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Providing Insurance to Support the Spread of Renewable Energy\n\nWith the growth of the renewable energy market, insurance is essential for facilitating development projects. The required insurance and underwriting methods can vary widely, however, according to the many types of renewable energy development projects, including wind, solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal, and tidal power generation facilities as well as power storage equipment.\n\nFor example, the insurance for an offshore wind power plant would need to include property insurance, liability insurance, and profits insurance to cover losses from property damage. Various companies would be involved during the period from the time construction begins to the start of commercial operations, including the construction company that builds the foundation and\n\nstructure, as well as the manufacturers of cables and wind turbines. The plant operator, however, would need to organize the insurance coverage for all of these activities, and then secure various types of insurance coverage from the commencement of commercial operations. Since offshore construction is complex and steps must be taken to reduce construction mistakes and prepare for typhoons, this kind of development project requires highly sophisticated underwriting and damage insurance planning. Furthermore, these projects cannot secure financing unless insurance coverage has been arranged. Given these factors, insurance is essential for offshore wind power to make progress going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Insurance coverage of  all construction-related risks Property  insurance          | Insurance coverage of  all operational risks Maintenance period                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Third-party liability insurance  related to construction work Liability  insurance | Third-party liability insurance  related to operations Maintenance period                                              |\n| Insurance coverage of  delayed operations  Profits  insurance                      | Business interruption  insurance                                                                                       |\n| final investment decision, and notice to                                           | Insurance period: From the financial close,  Insurance period: Insurance contracts  are renewed annually following the |\n\n## Tokio Marine Group's Advanced Capabilities\n\nTokio Marine Group leverages its advanced underwriting expertise and leading damage insurance services to provide essential renewable energy-related insurance.\n\n## (1) Advanced underwriting expertise\n\nRisks related to renewable energy development projects differ from risks associated with conventional power plant and energy projects. Furthermore, potential accidents also differ according to the type of project, so very sophisticated underwriting techniques are necessary to handle the insurance for renewable energy development projects.\n\nTokio Marine Group has the capabilities needed to calculate suitable insurance premiums and effectively select risks based on vast amounts of loss data collected over the past three decades. As an example of these capabilities, group company, GCube, is able to provide $300 million of underwriting capacity-the industry's largest amount-for a single project.\n\nMoreover, Tokio Marine & Nichido began offering insurance for offshore wind power projects in 2013, when a demonstration offshore wind plant was built in Japan, and has provided insurance underwriting for such projects in Europe. Drawing from this track record and experience, it has been working to tap demand in Japan's offshore wind power insurance market, which has been growing as the Japanese government aims to increase the number of offshore wind power plants. At present, Tokio Marine & Nichido has acquired substantial know-how by underwriting about 50 offshore wind power projects in 10 countries.\n\n## (2) Leading damage insurance services\n\nOver the past decade, GCube has paid out over $700 million for about 4,000 insurance claims connected with renewable energy. The company's own team of renewable energy loss adjusters have been providing clients with expert advice on loss prevention. GCube has established an excellent reputation among its major clients by proactively sharing data with them and offering various policies for reducing risks.\n\n## Future outlook\n\nAs the decarbonization movement gains momentum in various countries around the world, Tokio Marine Group is channeling its expertise to help solve environmental issues by supporting the growing adoption of renewable energy with insurance and risk\n\nconsulting services. Through this process, the Group will expand its own operations. Specifically, it is aiming to increase insurance premium revenues by tens of billions of yen by 2030 compared with the amount in 2020.\n\nThe course of a hurricane\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDamages assessed by loss adjusters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n04",

        "page_content": "Special Feature 3-2 Responding to Social Issues in the Field of Cyber Risk\n\nWe will protect and raise awareness of cyber risk for our customers, while carrying out our appropriate risk management using the Group's knowledge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global Head of Cyber Risk\n\n## Daljitt Barn\n\nMain career\n\nPreviously worked as a cyber risk expert for over 20 years before moving to a global reinsurance company where he developed the group Cyber insurance strategy.\n\n## Providing Cyber Insurance Products based on Appropriate Risk Management\n\nIn recent years, cyberattacks continue to grow and change. This has caused cyber risk to become a business risk, where materiality issues in terms of business continuity, sharply increased the need for insurance among companies. UK-based TMK began providing cyber insurance from more than 20 years ago. We were also the first major non-life insurance company in Japan to begin offering cyber insurance in 2015. In this regard, we have established a track record and experience in protecting customers around the world from cyber risk. Looking ahead, cyber insurance is one field we should focus on to balance solutions to social issues with our own growth.\n\nCyber risk is unique in that it is an evolving peril with insufficient data on past incidents. For example, a single cyber or cloud security incident can cause a chain reaction broadly involving multiple companies and countries, which could result in a mass outage incident. Therefore, risk management requires extremely advanced knowledge of how these technologies are interconnected and their vulnerabilities.\n\n## /uni25A0 Trends in known case numbers of unauthorized computer access occurring within Japan*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *: Based on 'Status of the Occurrence of Acts of Unauthorized Computer Access,' a document published by the National Police Agency, MIC, and METI, in March 2021.\n\nOur Cyber Centre of Excellence (CCoE), which I head up, is located in London. CCoE is responsible for accumulation management and underwriting guidance on cyber risk for the entire Group, gathering and managing performance data, and making appropriate arrangements for reinsurance. CCoE also shares various know-how horizontally within the Group, as it seeks to enhance our risk management and pricing while utilizing outside knowledge and data.\n\nRecently, we have demonstrated our leading initiatives by publishing our quantification framework on 'silent cyber risk*,' symbolized by incidents whose liability is not explicitly covered by traditional non-life insurance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *: https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/Tokio\\_Marine\\_Group\\_Non-Af-firmative\\_Cyber\\_Risk\\_Assessment-INDUSTRY\\_RELEASE.pdf\n\n## Peripheral Services Beyond the Payment of Claims\n\nIn the event of an incident, it is important to not only pay out claims in a timely manner, but also provide services that help customers to avoid incidents in the first place. As recent examples of newly launched services, TMNF launched Tokio Cyber Port, an informative website on the latest cybersecurity technologies, and we also provide a benchmark reporting service through a tie-up with Guidewire Software, Inc. Providing added value through these peripheral services is one of our strengths and they help to reduce the loss rate by preventing incidents.\n\nUltimately, we have expanded our support of customers through our efforts toward steady growth in the field while utilizing our wealth of track records and experience, fully mindful of risk management and pricing. Going forward, we are committed to contributing to customers and society through cyber insurance.\n\nhttps://tokiocyberport.tokiomarine-nichido.co.jp/cybersecurity/s/ *Japanese only\n\n## Reference: Tokio Marine's Security Framework\n\nCybersecurity against cyberattacks is also an extremely important issue for us. We have identified cyber risk as a 'material risk' and we have established the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) under the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), putting into place a structure for collaboration between Tokio Marine Holdings and regional headquarters.\n\nAs a result of building and upgrading this global security structure, there have not been any major incidents. Yet, with an eye toward response to new threats that are becoming more sophisticated and stealthier by the day, we are working to build and strengthen our effective security structure cross-functionally across the Group from the standpoint of efficiency and effectiveness. This includes further strengthening security; not only for ourselves but at agencies and outsourcing partners, and conducting various drills and exercises involving all employees including management and sophisticated intrusion tests covering our remote work environment as well.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tokio Marine Group has realized its sustainable growth by drawing from its extensive know-how to assist its clients with health management.\n\n## Promoting Health Management-Oriented Business Models\n\nCompanies in various regions of Japan face serious difficulties in recruiting staff and raising productivity. In response to this issue, Tokio Marine Group has assigned over 200 employees to assist clients nationwide with their health management programs, drawing from the Group's expertise in this field. This expertise has been recognized by the inclusion of Tokio Marine Holdings in the Health & Productivity Stock Selection, a joint initiative by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Japanese government to recognize listed companies that have outstanding health and productivity management programs for six consecutive years.\n\nIt has become increasingly important for companies in Japan to acquire health management certification. Tokio Marine & Nichido has been helping its clients acquire certification by providing insurance products that allow them to balance work requirements with health and nursing care, along with mental health-related e-learning tools and work-related stress assessment services. Among newly certified companies in 2020, almost 20%, or about 2,000 firms, received these products and services. Having earned a strong reputation among clients, TMNF increased revenue from health management-focused insurance products by a CAGR of 6.9%.\n\n## Internal Initiatives *2\n\nFor Tokio Marine Group, employees are the drivers of its business. Therefore, helping them stay healthy is an important responsibility for management. Employees can work more effectively and maximize their potential when they are in good health, both mentally and physically. That, in turn, makes work more rewarding and life more fulfilling, and fosters both personal development and the growth of the Group. From this perspective, Tokio Marine Holdings has positioned health management at the core of the Group's management, and is promoting it groupwide under the leadership of its Chief Wellness Officer (CWO). More recently, the Group has taken steps to ensure the health and safety of employees while implementing more productive work practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, it has facilitated telecommuting and installed necessary equipment for this purpose (please see page 68), and is providing vaccines onsite to employees and their family members, as well as to employees of its agents and business partners.\n\nReflecting the Group's excellent reputation for health management, Tokio Marine Holdings has been included in the Health & Productivity Stock Selection for six consecutive years, and is the only company in Japan's insurance industry to be included in this prestigious program.\n\n- *2: More information about the Group's internal initiatives is presented in Tokio Marine Holdings' Sustainability Reports, available on the Company's website.\n\nTokio Marine Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe charter has been established as a health-oriented code of conduct for employees to promote Tokio Marine Group's goals for and approach to health management on a group-wide basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /uni25A0 Growth in Revenue from Health Management-Oriented Insurance Policies* (Billions of yen)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: Revenue from insurance premiums covering risks associated with workplace accidents involving employees, the consequent inability to work, and health and nursing care, provided by Tokio Marine & Nichido to companies and organizations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing Longevity Risks\n\nAs more and more people live past 100, the risks of living with an illness and using up one's financial assets before death are increasing. Managing those risks with life insurance is an area in which Tokio Marine & Nichido Life can demonstrate its strengths. By helping people lead a healthy life and extend the lifespan of their assets, the company has been growing at an industry-leading pace. The company has concluded 6.08 million in-force policies, for a CAGR of 19.4%, since it was established in 1996.\n\n## Helping Extend Healthy Lives\n\nA pioneer in Japan's life protection insurance market, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life not only manages life-related risks but also offers valuable healthcare support to help clients proactively prevent illness and avoid emergency situations. In Japan, while 89% of people have health insurance, the percentages of people with insurance policies covering the inability to work and long-term nursing care are only 12% and 14%, respectively*, so these markets still have room to grow. In that context, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life began offering a new insurance policy (named Anshin Nenkin Kaigo) in August 2021 to cover continuous nursing care and other related expenses following the onset of dementia. It also began offering services such as brain health checkups and an app designed to maintain and improve cognitive ability. By helping people extend their lives, the company will continue to grow in the future.\n\n*3: Figures are from a national market survey of insurance coverage conducted by the Japan Institute of Life Insurance.\n\n## /uni25A0 Benefits Offered by Tokio Marine & Nichido Life's Insurance Policies\n\nCoverage provided by general medical insurance\n\nPreventative medicine and healthcare\n\n## Healthcare support\n\n## Life insurance\n\n## Medical  Kit Yell\n\nOnline health consulting and medical advice app designed to prevent serious illness (please see page 29)\n\nBrain training app designed to maintain and improve cognitive ability\n\n| Household income  term insurance                   | Anshin Nenkin  Kaigo               |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Japan's first *4  insurance                        | Coverage for                       |\n| policy covering job loss  due to inability to work | dementia and related  nursing care |\n\n- *4: Guarantees a specified amount of lost income during the insured period when the insurance holder is unable to work due to illness (one of five different diseases) or death.\n\n## Helping Extend Asset Life\n\nRecognizing the growing importance of asset accumulation planning for abundant lives in old age, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has been offering installment variable annuities under the product name, Market Link, since August 2017.\n\nThis product diversifies investment over many years to reduce investment risks and build wealth over the long-term.

The growing severity of natural disasters directly impacts the insurance industry. Therefore, the Group recognizes that climate change is an extremely important issue to address head on not only in terms of our core insurance business, but also as a global company and institutional investor.\n\nThis special feature section will convey the Group's initiatives using the categories of governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets based on the TCFD recommendations.\n\n## Category\n\n## See pages\n\nGovernance\n\nStrategies\n\nRisk Management\n\nIndicators  and Targets\n\n85\n\n85-89\n\n90\n\n91\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance\n\n## (1) Division dedicated to promoting sustainability\n\nTokio Marine has a division dedicated to the promotion of the Group's sustainability including climate change countermeasures (Sustainability Division, Corporate Planning Department), which identifies major challenges related to sustainability as well as formulates and implements related group-wide strategies, and conducts monitoring.\n\n## (2) Group Chief Sustainability Officer (CSUO)\n\nWe established the new position of CSUO in April 2021 in order to accelerate the promotion of sustainability strategy across the entire Group including climate change countermeasures. As the person responsible for our sustainability strategy, the CSUO is responsible for addressing sustainability issues facing the entire Group and reporting to the Group CEO.\n\n## (3) Sustainability Committee\n\nWe established the Sustainability Committee, chaired by the CSUO and comprised of members including the CEO and other C-suite, in April 2021 in order to accelerate sustainability strategy across the entire Group including climate change countermeasures. The Sustainability Committee establishes sustainability strategy and targets for the entire Group, focused on major Group companies inside and outside of Japan, and deliberated on the coordination and promotion of glocal sustainability initiatives (please see page 71 for the promotion system centered around the Sustainability Committee).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (4) Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors discusses the Group's sustainability policies including climate change countermeasures as well as evaluates and determines mid-term plans and single-year plans.

As part of this, we conduct various forms of analysis, such as risk measurement * and scenario analysis, and\n\nhave made efforts to upgrade our capabilities. This is truly a domain where we excel.\n\nFor the disclosure of risks we have examined ways to provide useful information to stakeholders, while taking into consideration impacts on business, and we plan to provide more detailed disclosures in our sustainability report scheduled to be published in September 2021.\n\n04",

        "page_content": "## (2) Transition  Risks\n\nTransition risks mainly involve risks caused by fluctuations in prices of financial assets with large greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transition to a decarbonized society. We have developed a system for better understanding the situation of the Group's investments and comprehending the balance of assets under management.\n\nBecause transition risks are considerably affected by transition scenarios such as the future response to energy policies, we have examined ways to provide clear and useful information to stakeholders and we plan to provide more detailed disclosures in our sustainability report scheduled to be published in September 2021.\n\nFurthermore, from the perspective of ownership restrictions in response to the risk of asset price fluctuations, the Group has worked to reduce its total business-related equities regardless of sector from some time prior to the release of Japan's Corporate Governance\n\nCode. Under the new mid-term business plan, the Company plans to sell more than \u00a5100 billion per year (please see page105).\n\n## /uni25A0 Book Value of Business-related Equities (TMNF)*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (3) Opportunities\n\n## 1. Dramatic increase in insurance needs for renewable energy projects\n\nDriven by global warming and climate change, countries around the world are speeding up their move toward decarbonization. In the process of promoting reduction and cessation of greenhouse gas emissions, there is expected to be a dramatic increase in insurance needs for renewable energy projects, such as solar, geothermal, and onshore/offshore wind power generation. With the importance of response to global warming and climate change growing, we can achieve growth through support for the adoption of renewable energy by drawing upon the Group's accumulated wisdom.\n\n## 2. Growing public awareness toward the risk posed by natural disasters and improving earnings of fire insurance\n\nAs the frequency and scale of natural disasters increases, there is growing needs for expanded coverage and extensive services in the case of a disaster, but fire insurance continues to be plagued by chronic losses. By revising rates, reviewing products, strengthening underwriting, and implementing comprehensive countermeasures including disaster preparedness and mitigation, and early restoration, we can significantly improve fire insurance earnings.\n\n## (4) Implementation of Climate Change Strategy\n\n## 1. Insurance underwriting, etc.\n\n## A. Basic stance ('Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy' announced on September 28, 2020)\n\nThe Group fully recognizes the importance of understanding the impacts that our business has on the environment and society. We are engaging in insurance underwriting that can contribute to the transition to a decarbonized society aimed at achievement of the Paris Agreement targets.\n\nAs part of this strategy, in principle, we will not underwrite new insurance policies for coal-fired thermal power plants. However, there may be instances where we do underwrite these policies based on a comprehensive judgment referencing international guidelines such as the OECD's Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, and considering such factors as the country's energy policy, energy situation and business continuity. This proviso provides exceptions. These include cases where renewable energy must be adopted or promoted while still operating existing facilities associated with technologies that further lower CO2 emissions based on the country's plan for decarbonization and cases where widespread power outages occur due to Great East Japan Earthquake-level events. As of June 30,\n\n2021, we have not underwritten any new insurance policies since announcing 'Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy' on September 28, 2020.\n\nIn addition, we are supporting initiatives to lower CO2 emissions by engaging power plants already with insurance policies to consider the environment through adoption of innovative high efficiency power generation technologies and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS/carbon recycling) technologies that reduce or stop greenhouse gas emissions. We are also engaging all customers involved in coal-fired thermal power generation to support their transition through product provision and/or consulting. Furthermore, after announcing 'Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy,' we have created and began using an engagement sheet to confirm and record plans aimed at realization of a decarbonized society. If through dialogue it is determined that a customer is not considering its response to decarbonization, we may not permit the renewal of the customer's insurance policy.\n\n## B. Provide insurance for the development of renewable energy projects\n\nThe Group provides insurance products and offers risk consulting to back the development of renewable energy projects. Specifically, in addition to the Mega-Solar Package Program for solar power generation companies and the Geothermal Package Plan for geothermal power generation businesses, in March 2020 we developed a dedicated insurance package offering comprehensive coverage of risks associated with offshore wind power generation projects (providing seamless coverage to customers not only during construction, but also a predefined period after the start of commercial operations). In addition, in May 2020, we acquired GCube, an insurance agent providing insurance underwriting for renewable energy projects around the world mainly in the United\n\n## Initiatives as an Insurance Company\n\nStates and Europe but also in Australia, South Africa and Asia. We are now utilizing this company's know-how at the Group level. Furthermore, Tokio Marine dR Co., Ltd. is also providing consulting services in various domains such as offshore wind power generation by utilizing its proprietary natural disaster risk assessment model and specialized human resources in renewable energy.\n\nWith the importance of response to global warming and climate change growing, we can achieve growth through support for the adoption of renewable energy as a leader in the field, further accelerating initiatives as 'One Tokio Marine Group' by drawing upon the Group's accumulated wisdom (please see pages 78-79).\n\n## C. Growing public awareness toward the risk posed by natural disasters and creation of a sustainable fire insurance system\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Japan was once again faced with large-scale natural disasters in the July 2020 torrential rains and Typhoon No. 10 (Haishen). Industry-wide insurance claims related to natural disasters exceeded \u00a5300 billion, which included around \u00a5100 billion in claims to Tokio Marine Group.\n\nAmid growing needs for greater coverage and extensive services during a disaster driven by the increasing frequency and scale of natural disasters in recent years, we are implementing a nationwide campaign to check the details of customers' policies in an effort to steadily grow the top line.\n\nAs a one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, Japan's fire insurance system is extremely important, but it is hardly sustainable if the business experiences chronic losses. While our own efforts to reduce costs are critical, by revising rates, reviewing products, strengthening underwriting, and accelerating comprehensive countermeasures including disaster preparedness and mitigation, and early restoration, we aim to improve earnings by more than \u00a526 billion (before tax) over three years and secure profitability in line with capital cost within several years after that (please see page 55).\n\n## /uni25A0 Net premiums written for fire insurance (TMNF) (billions of yen)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives as an Insurance Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJuly 2020 torrential rains\n\nSource: Original photo taken from the website of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and modified\n\nTyphoon No. 10 (Haishen) Source: Original photo taken from Jiji Press and modified\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /uni25A0 Combined ratio of fire insurance (TMNF) (%)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Acceleration of claim payments\n\nAs an insurance company, the most important matter for Tokio Marine is providing peace of mind to people affected by natural disasters as quickly as possible in the form of claim payments. Insurance payouts give people fortitude to face the future. Believing this, we have worked to speed up claim payments using digitalization.\n\nSpecifically, we have largely streamlined this process by allowing customers to apply for insurance claims using their smartphone and utilizing digital technology such as satellites, AI and RPA for confirming damages and administrative work. Fiscal 2020 was particularly challenging because of the response to natural\n\n## Initiatives as an Insurance Company\n\ndisasters during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we used these mechanisms to facilitate operations.\n\nAs part of our customer response, it is also important to be mindful of the feelings of people affected by disasters. We are dedicating the time created from the use of digitalization toward attending to customers and expanding the domains where we provide value, which will allow us to elevate our level of customer service.\n\nCustomers have praised us highly for our enhanced support of disaster-affected persons through the fusion of people's ability with digitalization, which has led to a further increase in the support for us.\n\n## /uni25A0 Results of insurance payout survey for fiscal 2020 (TMNF)\n\nCustomers who were satisfied:\n\n94.5%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Highly satisfied/Satisfied/Somewhat satisfied Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied Somewhat dissatisfied Dissatisfied Very dissatisfied\n\n## E. Delivering peace of mind before and after events (contribution to a disaster-resistant society)\n\nThe payment of claims is an insurance company's most important function, but we believe that this alone will not enable us to protect our customers. It would be preferable if disasters don't occur. If disasters do occur, damages should be minimized and the recovery quick. It would be preferable if disasters don't reoccur. Based on\n\n## Initiatives as an Insurance Company\n\nthese beliefs, the Group strives to provide peace of mind before and after events through disaster preparedness and mitigation, quick restoration and recurrence prevention. These efforts also lower the loss rate and result in greater support from customers.\n\n## Specific examples\n\n- \u00b7 We provide support that includes corporate risk evaluations, and help formulating a business continuity plans (BCP) in collaboration with local governments and financial institutions, making use of advanced expertise held within Group companies.\n- \u00b7 Using the lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake, we host the Disaster Risk Prevention Lesson, an outreach class for elementary school students, based on our commitment to teach children knowledge about disaster preparedness for the next disaster that may strike.\n- \u00b7 Under the 'Total assist fire insurance x Red Feather Disaster prevention/reduction program' launched in July 2021, part of the costs defrayed from online insurance contracts and policies will be donated to Red Feather Community Chest for use in disaster preparedness and mitigation activities in customers' own communities (please see page 55).\n- \u00b7 The AI-powered Flooding risk projection system developed with the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience visualizes areas at high risk of flooding to support local governments' decision-making during torrential rains, which helps to minimize damages to residents (please see pages 29, 55).\n- \u00b7 Through a business partnership with BELFOR Japan, a specialist in disaster recovery, we are providing services that support customers' recovery from disasters (both before and after) (please see page 55).\n\nThe Group will utilize digitalization and data in a sophisticated manner to further enhance these services for 'peace of mind before and after.' Specifically, we will hire a team of experts in digitalization at Tokio Marine dR Co., Ltd., our core data company established in July 2021. This will allow us to speed up initiatives and tackle new challenges so that we can support customers in their time of need and evolve into a company that always supports its customers (please see pages 28-29).\n\n## Number of collaboration agreements with local governments *1\n\n- \u00b7 Prefectures: 38\n- \u00b7 Ordinance-designated cities: 10\n- \u00b7 Other cities: 52\n- *1: Agreements on regional revitalization, such as help formulating BCPs, etc.\n\nIn Kochi, we are working with Kochi Prefecture, Kochi City, and the Kochi Chamber of Commerce & Industry to help around 700 companies formulate BCPs over a 10-year period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Disaster Risk Prevention Lesson\n\n- \u00b7 Held around 810 times\n\n\u00b7 Around 55,000 participants\n\n(Cumulative as of March 31, 2021)\n\nDisaster Risk Prevention Lesson (President Hirose, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Financing ('Tokio Marine: Our Climate Strategy' announced on September 28, 2020)\n\nIn principle, we will not extend new financing to coal-fired thermal power plants in order to contribute to the transition to a decarbonized society. However, similar to other insurance underwriting, we may extend financing to these projects after comprehensively judging the situation based on the country's energy policy or international guidelines. This proviso provides exceptions similar to other insurance underwriting. In actuality, we have not extended new financing to coal-fired thermal power plants as of June 30, 2021.\n\nAs a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) through Group companies Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine Asset Management, we have established an ESG investment policy considering not only financial information but also elements such as environmental, social and governance. By incorporating climate-related elements into the investment decision-making process, we are supporting the transition to a decarbonized society.\n\nSpecifically, we are undertaking ESG engagement supporting increased corporate value and sustainable growth of target\n\n## Initiatives as an Institutional Investor\n\ncompanies through constructive and purposeful dialogue considering non-financial factors including ESG elements in addition to financial data and ESG integration where both financial and non-financial data is used in the investment decision-making process.\n\nTokio Marine Asset Management has managed a renewable energy fund targeting investments in solar power plants since 2012, effectively backing initiatives aimed at the transition to a decarbonized society.\n\n## /uni25A0 Performance of Renewable Energy Funds *2 (Cumulative as of March 31, 2021)\n\nAmount committed\n\nApprox. \u00a551 billion\n\nUnits installed\n\n45\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2: TM Nippon Solar Energy Fund 2012, 2013 and 2014 TM Nippon Renewable Energy Fund 2017 TM Nippon Long-Term Natural Energy Fund 2020\n\n## 3. Lead Discussions at International Climate Change Conferences\n\nSince climate change is an important social issue that needs to be addressed by the entire world, the Group actively engages in dialogue with international organizations, governments, industries, academics, NPOs and NGOs. We have also led discussions at international conferences, which includes a co-chairing climate change-related working group for The Geneva Association, since 2008.\n\nThe Group has contributed to the formulation of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations as a member, and we also promote the dissemination of climate-related disclosure in Japan in part through involvement in the launch of the TCFD Consortium.\n\nIn addition, we have taken a leading role for the entire industry as a founding member of the UNEP FI's TCFD pilot insurance group, and as a global enterprise will continue to actively take measures against climate change.\n\n## Initiatives as a Global Enterprise\n\nThe Sustainable Markets Initiative, an insurance industry task force whose concept was created by Prince Charles of the U.K. was established in June 2021 with 17 member companies.

To give an example, we evaluate and calculate the impact on insurance loss from changes in typhoon risk and flood risk due to torrential rain based on assumed climatic conditions in\n\nthe future. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is being implemented throughout the Group in consideration of the impact of natural disasters on underwriting that may be exacerbated by climate change, referring to the findings of these scenario analyses (please see pages 110-113).\n\n## 1. Qualitative Risk Management\n\nWe identify all forms of risk exhaustively, including natural disasters such as major storms and newly emerging risks due to environmental changes. We define risks that will have an extremely large impact on our financial soundness and business continuity as\n\n## 2. Quantitative Risk Management\n\nFor material risks, we measure risk amounts and upgrade stress tests as part of our quantitative risk management.\n\nWe calculate risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model we developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and for overseas, models provided by outside vendors). We gather the latest information as well as verify and evaluate models and upgrade them to ensure the situation of recent natural disasters is reflected in models appropriately.\n\n'material risks' (natural disaster risk including climate related risk is one such risk). We also formulate control measures prior to risk emergence and response measures for after risks occur.\n\nWe also conduct stress tests based on severe scenarios involving low likelihood disasters that will result in significant damages if they were to occur. For example, these scenarios include typhoons and flooding on a much larger scale than the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019 causing extensive damages. We update scenarios continuously while considering stress tests released by regulatory authorities in each country, the latest knowledge including climate change, and recent case studies.\n\n## (2) Acquisition of knowledge (industry-academia collaboration, etc.)\n\nThe Group is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts in order to acquire knowledge about risks.\n\nThe Tokio Marine Research Institute, a Group company, carries out impact analysis based on the possibility for increased insurance losses associated with natural disasters that are becoming more severe in nature. We have an R&D team located in Atlanta in the United States with expertise in natural disasters. This team is leading efforts to upgrade risk management of natural disasters across the entire Group, including various evaluations of natural disaster risk models, management of natural disaster exposure at our overseas business locations, and instantaneous impact prediction for such disasters as hurricanes hitting North America.\n\nIn terms of external collaboration, the Group is working with the University of Tokyo, Nagoya University and Kyoto University, among others, to research *1 the impacts of climate change on the insurance industry over the short, medium and long term as well as identify and evaluate climate related risks. We also invite experts in the name of sustainability dialogue to regularly share the latest knowledge on sustainability with senior management and discuss the Group's initiatives.\n\n- *1: Forecasting of future changes in typhoon risk using climate models, analysis of changes in rainfall trends associated with global warming, and flood risk evaluation under future climate conditions, etc.\n\n## (3) Appropriately control risk through risk diversification and reinsurance, etc.\n\nNatural disasters are inevitable in Japan, our home market. For that reason, we have sought to control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A overseas (please see pages 18-21). Through these efforts, we managed to keep net incurred losses from natural disasters exceeding our average budget to only around 5% *2 of the entire Group's profits for fiscal 2020. In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is also\n\nan effective way to protect our capital and stabilize profits. The Group utilizes reinsurance to prepare for natural disasters (capital events) that occur once every few centuries, and we determine earnings coverage from the standpoint of economic rationality and take necessary measures.\n\n*2: Proportion of claim payments related to natural disasters that exceeded the initial forecast\n\n## Indicators and Targets\n\n## (1) Targets for fiscal 2030\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction targets for greenhouse gases associated with our own business activities\n\nReduce greenhouse gases emitted by the Tokio Marine Group by 60% compared to fiscal 2015 levels *1\n\n- \u00b7 Target for introduction rate of renewable energy to total electricity consumption Source 100% of the electricity used at the Tokio Marine Group's main business locations from renewable energy\n- \u00b7 Electrification of company-owned vehicles (TMNF, TMNL)\n\nSwitch all company-owned vehicles of TMNF and TMNL to EVs, PHVs or HVs, etc.\n\n## (2) Targets for fiscal 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Increase net premiums written for insurance of offshore wind power generation projects by around \u00a55 billion (TMNF) \u00b7 Improve fire insurance earnings by more than \u00a526 billion (before tax) (TMNF)\n\n## (3) Others\n\n## \u00b7 Continue to achieve carbon neutrality on a Groupwide basis *1\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido Fire has been implementing a mangrove planting project in the Asia Pacific region together with NGOs since 1999. These planting activities have enabled the Group to achieve carbon neutrality *1 in its business activities for eight years running since fiscal 2013. We plan to continue this initiative going forward to sustain our carbon neutrality. The value of ecosystem services produced over the past 20 years (April 1999 to March 31, 2019) through this mangrove planting project cumulatively totals \u00a5118.5 billion.

I find it very unique that Tokio Marine conducts frequent discussions on various themes that also include the outside officers.\n\nMitachi: Also, there are many instances where we receive presentations directly from staff outside of the board, including persons in charge of individual business departments according to the theme, and exchange opinions with them.\n\nOtsuki: Absolutely. Tokio Marine's major feature is that it actively creates opportunities that involve not only the management who are regulars at board meetings, but a variety of members including mid-level employees in our discussions. For outside directors and auditors, it is very helpful to hear directly from employees who are at the frontline of each business. Also, for employees, it provides a great opportunity to consider business from a different perspective than what they are used to through exchanging ideas with those outside of the company. In this manner, by sharing ideas between people who come from different job positions and standpoints, we get to consider topics from multiple angles, which gives rise to very solid and wide-spanning discussions, which, I believe, by extension, improves board effectiveness.\n\nThere are views in the stock market that outside officers should focus on the monitoring aspect and it could be problematic if they get too involved with inside officers. How do you two feel about the role of outside officers?\n\nMitachi: As a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, we have created a disciplined governance structure including a voluntary Nomination Committee and a Compensation Committee with outside directors leading the meeting discussions. However, this structure barely meets the minimum requirement, and in order to prevent damage to corporate value and instead enhance such value, it is critical to look at how to run these committees. Otsuki: To that end, as I mentioned earlier, it is important for directors and auditors both inside and outside the company to conduct discussions in a horizontal manner, regardless of their rank or standpoint. In particular, I think it is necessary for outside officers to speak and act while feeling the weight of the trust bestowed by shareholders. For this reason, it is unacceptable to fulfill our roles only ceremonially. When a meeting is formalized, it tends to be filled with statements such as 'I would like to give my opinion from the perspective of governance for the time being.'\n\nMitachi: For example, we cannot have constructive discussions in a formalized meeting, such that we could discuss the compelling reasons for implementing a project, what risks are involved in the execution, how to control these risks, and how to expand such projects in the future. In this sense, I feel like we are running meetings in the company effectively without them being only ceremonies.\n\nOtsuki: 'What is the point of having people outside of the company who are not familiar with our business serving as directors or auditors?' It is also true that some people have doubts such as this. However, as far as the outside officers of Tokio Marine are concerned, they have a certain level of knowledge about the business through on-site inspections and talks with employees, as well as through meeting materials clearly outlining issues and sufficient prior briefings. On top of this, since they are specialized in areas other than insurance, they can often provide suggestions on our business challenges from perspectives that we don't normally notice from inside the company. Mitachi: Since outside officers come from various backgrounds, there are many diverse opinions and it is not unusual to hear opposite standpoints.\n\nOtsuki: Just the other day, there was a heated debate on a certain strategy with divided opinions among the outside officers. I think this is a very good thing for the company's governance. For people who are mutually external to one company to be able to take on a debate that seriously, I feel it is not only driven by each speaker's personal character, but there is an ingrained corporate culture that enables everyone to speak freely.\n\nMitachi: I have served as an outside director of Tokio Marine for four years. I feel it is the company's strength that outside officers are playing a substantial role this way, with this being yielded through the process of our business operations, which has a slight advantage.\n\n## Business Portfolio Strategy Strengthen monitoring of M&A\n\nHow do you evaluate the portfolio reshuffling of recent years?\n\nMitachi: Tokio Marine has recently made decisions to sell multiple businesses, which I think stands as proof that our portfolio strategy is functioning well. Tokio Marine has optimized its business portfolio through acquiring companies with unique businesses and outstanding management. However, as the market environment changes rapidly, we need to welcome new businesses into our portfolio while carving out and divesting businesses that no longer fit in with the purpose of our strategy in order to optimize our portfolio.\n\n05",

        "page_content": "Particularly for Japanese businesses, there are many instances where their overseas subsidiaries are sold off due to a downturn in business performance that cannot be salvaged.\n\nOtsuki: In that respect, we have started considering divesting businesses from an early stage that are no longer in line with the purpose of the Group Strategy or for which profit growth cannot be expected from a future perspective. I believe this is driven by the strong conviction among our board members to fulfill shareholders' expectations as they have invested capital in us.\n\nMitachi: Of course, since we are not an investment company, we do not have to constantly replace our business portfolio, but we must be cautious to some extent. Looking at recent examples such as the sale of TMR, which was a stepping stone for our overseas expansion, we find that the sale was made at a very appropriate timing, which was a positive move for our corporate value.\n\nOtsuki: In addition to large merger deals, we also have a track record of over 60 successful deals in bolt-on acquisitions that complement our existing business model. The new Mid-Term Business Plan aims to further enhance the quality of M&A, which also includes such\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Takashi Mitachi\n\nHe has worked for Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. and the Boston Consulting Group, where he is currently a senior advisor. He also serves as an outside director of Rakuten Group, Inc. and DMG Mori Co., Ltd. He became a director of Tokio Marine in June 2017.\n\nbolt-on acquisitions, under the proactive governance of Tokio Marine Holdings. I would also like to carefully monitor the progress of this measure.\n\nMitachi: One other thing is Tokio Marine's positive attitude toward risk taking as a distinctive feature in its M&A strategy. Perhaps because its core business is insurance that takes on various risks, I feel the philosophy is built in to the company's management such that we should not take too much risk, and at the same time, we should take enough risks.\n\nOtsuki: For sure that the company is very conscious of return on risk. Generally speaking, risks are considered to be negative and conversations tend to be dominated by how to reduce risks. However, in Tokio Marine's situation, we have quite a few discussions on whether we can take on more risks.\n\n## What are some future challenges?\n\nMitachi: I think it will be a big challenge for the next generation of board members to consider how to incorporate new frontier areas into the foundation of our global business portfolio that we have developed to date. Otsuki: Large Japanese corporations usually say no to taking risks, but Tokio Marine is conscious of 'return on risk,' 'unafraid of challenges,' and 'learning from mistakes.' If we take on frontier areas in our business, having the corporate culture we do will serve as a great advantage.\n\nMitachi: Absolutely. In our business operations, for\n\nexample, promotion of DX, there are many things that we don't know or cannot foresee until we actually give it a try. As well, I believe we have success today in our overseas expansion as we were able to critically analyze and draw on our experience of failure 40 years ago while having the spirit of trying again. Again, in the future, I believe we must stand firmly with both feet without fear of failure and we should embrace trial and error. Otsuki: Another issue is that it is necessary to continue to have a sense of urgency in a good sense. While Tokio Marine is currently the world's top class insurance company, I think it is important to continue having a healthy sense of urgency in order to achieve further growth from here on. I had a conversation with a mid-level employee the other day. The person was working on addressing concerns they have had including the fact that other companies are enhancing their competitiveness and that Tokio Marine cannot do business the same way 10 years from now. It is\n\nimportant to have such solid sense of urgency for everyone from management to young employees. I hope they will continue to grow and evolve with the awareness that the right answer today will not necessarily be the right answer tomorrow.\n\nMitachi: As many officers, including Ms. Otsuki, have pointed out this issue, while I also feel we are properly sharing our sense of urgency for now, I hope the outside officers will continue to monitor this area going forward.\n\n## Toward enhancement of corporate value over the medium to long term\n\nThe role of non-financial information in corporate value\n\nLastly, what are your thoughts or advice on how to enhance corporate value over the medium to long term?\n\nOtsuki: Until now, financial information such as sales and profits has been a major factor in determining corporate value. However, recently, the importance of non-financial information has been rapidly rising as ESG investment expands around the world.\n\nMitachi: The non-financial information Ms. Otsuki has pointed out is called non-competitive factors in my specialized area of consulting, which is indeed gaining traction. Conventionally, competitive factors such as the efficiency of operations and quality of marketing often had a direct impact on corporate value. However, nowadays, we have entered an era in which corporate value is also greatly influenced by factors outside the framework of simple microeconomic competition, including the ability to deal with issues such as climate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nana Otsuki\n\nShe has worked as an analyst at various financial institutions, including Standard & Poor's Ratings Japan K.K. and Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., Ltd.

Otsuki: People inside the company bear the burden of business performance in numbers, and can't help but orient themselves in that direction. For that reason, it is more important than ever for outside officers to provide opinions and suggestions on initiatives for non-financial information and non-competitive factors.\n\nMitachi: That is true. I think we will continuously enhance corporate value by sharing opinions on how to use these non-competitive factors to benefit shareholders from multiple viewpoints.\n\nOtsuki: In the new Mid-Term Business Plan, we have announced that we will newly include 'future generation' in our stakeholders. In that sense, I believe we are further expected to take responsible actions while thinking about the future. Going forward, I hope all outside officers will continue to fulfill our monitoring role while thinking together with everyone.\n\nThank you for your time today.",

As an insurance holding company, the Company determines significant business execution by resolution of the Board of Directors, and emphasizes making high-quality decisions that reflect the insight of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members.\n\nFor the nomination and compensation of directors, topics important for monitoring,  deliberations are handled by the respective committees, which are each chaired by an Outside Director and with Outside Directors comprising a majority of their membership. Here, decisions are made while ensuring transparency. In this way, we have determined that the current system, which emphasizes management functions while also ensuring monitoring functions, is optimal at this point in time. However, we also believe that we must be in constant pursuit of the most optimal solutions, and we will continue to work toward building better corporate governance systems.\n\n## Corporate Governance

Meetings are entirely conducted by independent directors, including establishing agenda items. Opinions are exchanged objectively and from broad perspectives. In fiscal 2020, discussions were held on diversity, human resources development, governance, and other issues, with recommendations made based on these discussions.\n\n## 'Discussions on Corporate Strategy' Themes\n\n|   Fiscal Year | Themes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|          2020 | The Tokio Marine Group's next Medium-Term Business Plan, exchange of views with overseas subsidiary heads, the Tokio  Marine Group's domestic life and non-life insurance business strategy, the Tokio Marine Group's digital strategy, and  direction of human resources strategy |\n|          2019 | The initiatives of Tokio Marine Group for CSR/Sustainability and SDGS, exchange of views with overseas subsidiary heads,  digital strategy for Tokio Marine Group                                                                                                                  |\n|          2018 | The domestic life and non-life insurance business strategy for Tokio Marine Group, direction of human resource strategy,  exchange of views with overseas subsidiary heads, digital strategy for Tokio Marine Group                                                                |",

We acquired companies whose cultures matched our own with our desire to make the world a better place through our business, but to further spread the Group's common culture of 'To Be a Good Company,' we have been implementing a variety of initiatives around the world, such as the 'Majikirakai,' a group that talks about serious matters very casually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA town hall meeting in Philadelphia led by CEO Komiya\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA town hall meeting (President Hirose, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reduction of Business-Related Equities\n\n## Initiatives to Reduce the Total Value\n\nBusiness-related equities are held primarily to strengthen business relationships and enhance the Group's corporate value, but the Company will continue to reduce the total value of shares held with a view to improving capital efficiency. In fact, the Company began its efforts well before the release of the Corporate Governance Code, and since fiscal 2002, the Company sold a total of 2.3 trillion yen (based on market value at the time of sale), and the book value has decreased to 33% of the March 31, 2002 level. Under the new mid-term business plan, the Company plans to sell more than \u00a5100 billion per year.\n\nFor listed domestic business-related equities, the Board of Directors examines the risk/return of holding these stocks, both in the overall portfolio and on an individual basis, to validate the economic rationale for holding them.\n\n## Book Value of Business-related Equities*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Indexed to the end of Mar. 2002 as 100\n\nFor details on our policies regarding business-related equities,\n\nplease refer to the Corporate Governance Report. https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/company/governance/corpora te\\_governance/pdf/210628\\_Corporate\\_Governance\\_Report.pdf\n\n## Dialogue Based on the Stewardship Code\n\nThroughout the year, the Company holds 'dialogues with companies with particularly large market values' and 'dialogues based on market value and financial conditions,' as well as 'dialogues based on voting rights exercise criteria' in the process of scrutinizing proposals for general meetings of shareholders of the companies in which the Company invests, and exercises voting rights based on these dialogues.\n\n## Policy for Dialogue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Examples of Dialogues with Investees\n\n## Content of the Dialogue\n\nFor companies that have released their integrated reports since this fiscal year, we have deepened our dialogue on medium- and long-term reduction targets, with discussions centered on their corporate efforts to reduce CO2 emissions to fight global warming.\n\n## Response of Investees\n\nWe confirmed their intention to move forward with initiatives with a high awareness of environmental issues, especially toward reduction of CO2 emissions. In the mid-term business plan that was subsequently released, it was announced that addressing climate change would be a key environmental issue and that targets for total greenhouse gas emissions reduction would be a key evaluation indicator.\n\nFor more other dialogue examples and the results of exercises of voting rights, please refer to the overview of our stewardship activities available on Tokio Marine & Nichido's website.

Furthermore, through constructive dialogue between management and shareholders and investors, the Company will gain an appropriate understanding of how it is viewed and the state of the capital markets, and provide that understanding and feedback to management and within the Company to lead to improvement of management itself and further enhance corporate value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dialogue with Investors\n\n## Dialogue with Institutional Investors\n\nIn order to engage in dialogue with a wide range of shareholders and investors, the Company not only holds financial results conference calls, but also holds IR conferences and theme-focused strategy conferences both onsite and on the internet, broadcast live across the globe.\n\nIn particular, in November 2020, we held the industry's first full-fledged Investor Day. In this half-day event, we provided well fleshed-out communication of our vision for the new medium-term plan, growth drivers, and our approach to capital policy. In addition, in June 2020 and January 2021, we held briefings focused on digital strategies and climate change strategies, topics of great interest for capital markets.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we elected to forgo face-to-face overseas IR activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In their place, we held dialogue with a total of 921 companies via telephone and online channels (198 more companies than the previous fiscal year) in order to further enhance our communication.\n\nInvestor Day\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we took all possible measures to prevent the spread of infection and held a conference featuring the Group CEO. The Company also provided easy-to-understand explanations of the 'Group's management strategy' and 'shareholder return,' which are of great interest to individual investors. These explanations received a 97% participant satisfaction rate, the highest value in the last five years.

While our employees have little interest in or familiarity with IR, but through IR activity reporting sessions, they understand the voice of capital markets, how the Company is evaluated, and how their own work is connected to the capital market. This results in a virtuous cycle with positive impact on their own motivation and growth.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we also used the internet to share and interact with 2,277 Group employees.\n\nRole playing a meeting with investors by IR Group members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\n## Presentation by the Group CEO\n\nIn order to promote a deeper understanding of the Company's\n\nmanagement and business, the Group CEO routinely conducts presentations. At the 19th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (held June 28, 2021), under the theme of 'Business Strategy of Tokio Marine Group,' the Group CEO gave an easy-to-understand presentation on topics of business performance, the Company's value creation story rooted in its business purpose, and its new medium-term plan.

        "page_content": "## Internal Control System\n\n## Fundamental Policy\n\nThe Company has formulated 'Basic Policies for Internal Controls.' In accordance with these policies, the Company has established an internal control system for the entire Tokio Marine Group that encompasses structures for management control, compliance, risk management, and internal auditing of Group companies. In addition, the Company monitors the status and practical application of its internal control system. The Internal Control Committee deliberates on the results of this monitoring, and the Board of Directors confirms the details of these deliberations. Moreover, the Company continually strengthens and improves its internal control system in light of the results of this monitoring. The Internal Audit Section maintains close coordination with Audit & Supervisory Board Members to ensure the effectiveness of their audits.\n\n## Internal Control System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe Company has formulated the 'Tokio Marine Group Basic Policies for Compliance' and the 'Tokio Marine Group Code of Conduct,' and a compliance system is in place Groupwide based on this framework. Also, the Company has built a structure to ensure Groupwide compliance by periodically monitoring the status of compliance within the Group; receiving reports from Group companies on important matters; discussing these matters among the Board of Directors, the Management Meeting, and the Internal Control Committee; and providing guidance and advice about the activities of Group companies when necessary.\n\nIn order to prepare for cases in which it is not appropriate to report compliance issues through the organization's usual reporting channels, we have established various internal and external hotlines (whistleblowing hotlines) to accept reports and consultations from executives and employees of Group companies. The number of reports and consultations received by the Group had been on an upward trend, partly due to increased interest in the hotline and efforts to raise awareness of the system. However, due to significant changes in business conditions driven by COVID-19, the number of reports and consultations received by the Group decreased to 255 in fiscal 2020, down 21% from the previous fiscal year. We ensure that these reports and consultations are appropriately investigated and responded to, leading to the early detection of problems and the implementation of corrective and recurrence prevention measures.\n\n## Compliance System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information Security Management\n\nTokio Marine recognizes the importance of personal information and confidential information ('information assets'). To ensure the appropriateness and trustworthiness of Tokio Marine Group's operations, we have formulated the 'Tokio Marine Group Policies for Information Security Management' and use appropriate methods to conduct information security management at each company in accordance with their line of business, scale, location, and other factors.\n\nWith regard to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, the Group is\n\nalso taking necessary measures based on the results of the Group's field survey on personal data in the EU.\n\nBased on the 'Tokio Marine Group Policies for Information Security Management,' each company establishes departments to oversee information security management and formulate policies and regulations. To protect information assets from various information leakage risks, including leak, loss, and unauthorized use, we ensure the confidentiality of information assets and manage them so that they can be used when necessary. Furthermore, the Company regularly monitors the information security management of group companies, setting up structures and providing information when necessary.\n\nFor our approach to cyber risk, please see pages 80-81.\n\n## Crisis Management System\n\nTokio Marine Group has established a crisis management system to minimize economic losses and other impacts incurred in an emergency and immediately restore ordinary business operations.\n\nThe Company has formulated the 'Tokio Marine Group Basic Policy for Crisis Management' and the 'Tokio Marine Group Crisis Management Manual' based on the policy, and has set forth the crisis management systems necessary for Group companies to carry out their own roles.\n\nGroup companies formulate crisis management policies in line with policies of the Group to develop crisis management systems that include establishing a department in charge of crisis management, decision-making procedures for emergency situations, and securing the chain of command. In addition to developing the crisis management system during normal conditions, the department in charge of crisis management plays the role of secretariat for response during emergency situations, including reporting to the Company.\n\nWhen conditions that may develop into an emergency situation arise, in addition to each Group company determining whether or not these conditions correspond to an emergency situation, the Company determines, if necessary, whether or not these conditions correspond to an emergency situation for the Group. This system enables the Company to properly instruct Group companies and make sure necessary actions as a Group can be made. In fiscal 2020, in response to the COVID-19 virus that caused an emergency situation for the Group, we developed and promoted a system that allows our employees to support customers remotely, and reviewed our business continuity plan based on the results of its implementation.\n\n## Internal/External Audits, etc.\n\nRegarding internal audits, there is a statutory audit conducted by Audit & Supervisory Board Members in accordance with the Companies Act and an internal audit performed by the Internal Audit Section. The internal audit is performed based on the 'Internal Auditing Rules' that have been approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nRegarding external audits, there is an accounting audit based on the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and an internal control audit based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata.\n\nTokio Marine Holdings is also subject to inspections by the Financial Services Agency of Japan pursuant to the Insurance Business Law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n05",

Specifically, we will be constantly aware of the relationship between 'risk,' 'capital' and 'profit,' and by realizing 'capital adequacy' and 'high profitability' in relation to risk, we will strive to achieve sustainable growth of corporate value.\n\nThe risks that the Group faces are getting more diverse and complex due to the expansion of global business and changes in the management environment. In addition, in the recent political, economic and social conditions which have much uncertainty and change, the Company must keep a close watch for new emerging risks and cope with them appropriately.\n\nFrom this perspective, the Company is not limited to traditional risk management aimed at risk mitigation and avoidance, but also comprehensively grasps risk by both qualitative and quantitative approaches.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Cycle\n\nReview and impr\n\no\n\nv\n\ne\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Qualitative Risk Management\n\nWith regard to qualitative risk management, the Company has a system in place to comprehensively identify and report all risks to management, including 'emerging risks' that may occur as a result of changes in the environment and other factors. The risks faced by the Group are discussed at the management level when necessary.\n\nThrough this process the Company makes comprehensive assessments of risks not limited to factors such as financial\n\ndamages or frequency, but it also adds factors such as business continuity and reputation. Those risks that seriously impact the financial soundness, business continuity of the entire Group or its Group companies are defined as 'material risks.'\n\nWe evaluate capital adequacy in relation to material risks through quantitative risk management process mentioned below. Preventive control measures before the risk takes place as well as the countermeasures after the risk takes place *1 are formulated and controlled by the PDCA cycle.\n\n- *1: Preventive control measures before the risk manifests include monitoring and risk aggregation management taking market environment and regulation trends into consideration. Countermeasures after the risk takes place include manuals (including business continuity plan, etc.) and conducting drills.\n\n## Identifying Emerging Risks and the Process of Determining Material Risks\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nNew risks that appear as a result of factors such as changes in the environment, risks that have previously not been acknowledged as risks, or risks whose severity has significantly increased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n05\n\nGovernance",

A risk capital of 99.95% VaR is equivalent to the damage caused\n\nby an occurrence of a risk that happens once in 2000 years. While many insurance companies around the world use 99.5% VaR (once in 200 years), Tokio Marine Group uses much more stringent standards to evaluate risk capital.\n\nTokio Marine Group has set its ESR target range at 100 to 140%. As of March 31, 2021, the ESR is 127%, indicating that the Group's level of capital is adequate.\n\nFurthermore, of the 'material risks' identified in the qualitative risk management, stress tests are conducted based on scenarios in which major economic loss are expected, and on scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time, in order to validate business continuity and to ensure that there are no issues with capital adequacy or liquidity of funds.\n\n- *2: Net asset value: Calculated by adding the value of catastrophe loss reserves, deducting for goodwill, and making other adjustments to consolidated net assets on a financial accounting basis.\n\n## Status of Economic Solvency Ratio (ESR)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *3: Risk is quantified using a model based on 99.95% VaR (corresponds to an AA credit rating)\n\n## Initiatives to Strengthen ERM Framework\n\nTokio Marine Group continues to take steps to further strengthen its ERM framework to address increasingly diverse and complex risks. For example, the Group has established ERM Committee as one of its global committees, which includes the Group CEO, CFO, CRO and other C-suite as well as management personnel from overseas Group companies to discuss Group ERM strategies and policies.\n\nIn the new medium-term plan, we will continue to make efforts toward strengthening both operational and financial resilience across the Group as a whole and at each individual Group company, both in Japan and overseas. We will make these efforts to ensure business continuity and/or rapid recovery during a major risk event. Furthermore, we will place special emphasis on developing processes for evaluating Group company capital efficiency and using this process as a basis for improving our business portfolio. We will also further evolve our risk assessments, including on cyber risk and other risks that are difficult to quantify.\n\n05",

Consolidated Results of Operations\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, after a significant slowdown due to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the world economy and Japanese economy showed signs of recovery with the resumption of economic activity. However, the situation remained severe due to the renewed spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the market environment improved and share prices rose significantly, due to the expansive fiscal and monetary policies implemented by major countries in response to the economic downturn.\n\nUnder these circumstances, as a result of our efforts to expand our domestic and overseas business, which is centered on non-life insurance and life insurance, our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 were as follows:\n\nOrdinary income decreased by 4.2 billion yen to 5,461.1 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, the main components of which were Underwriting income of 4,669.9 billion yen and Investment income of 661.4 billion yen. Ordinary expenses increased by 92.9 billion yen to 5,194.4 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, the main components of which were Underwriting expenses of 4,185.3 billion yen, Investment expenses of 79.5 billion yen, and Operating and general administrative expenses of 900.9 billion yen.\n\nAs a result, Ordinary profit decreased by 97.2 billion yen to 266.7 billion yen from the previous fiscal year.\n\nNet income attributable to owners of the parent, composed of Ordinary profit plus Extraordinary gains minus Extraordinary losses and Total income taxes, decreased by 97.9 billion yen to 161.8 billion yen from the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Domestic Non-Life Insurance (Unaudited)\n\nIn the Domestic non-life insurance business, Ordinary income decreased by 21.5 billion yen to 2,760.9 billion yen from the previous fiscal year. Ordinary profit decreased by 36.6 billion yen to 142.8 billion yen from the previous fiscal year. Figures pertaining to insurance underwriting and investment in the Domestic non-life insurance business are as follows.\n\n## Underwriting\n\nDirect premiums written (including deposit premiums from policyholders)\n\n|                                     | (Yen in millions)                        | (Yen in millions)                        | (Yen in millions)                        | (Yen in millions)                        | (Yen in millions)                        | (Yen in millions)                        |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                     | FY2020 (April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) | FY2020 (April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) | FY2020 (April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) | FY2019 (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) | FY2019 (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) | FY2019 (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) |\n|                                     | Amount                                   | Composition ratio (%)                    | Rate of change (%)                       | Amount                                   | Composition ratio (%)                    | Rate of change (%)                       |\n| Fire and allied lines               | 490,423                                  | 17.80                                    | 5.11                                     | 466,568                                  | 16.88                                    | 11.93                                    |\n| Hull and cargo                      | 67,958                                   | 2.47                                     | (4.98)                                   | 71,519                                   | 2.59                                     | 5.70                                     |\n| Personal accident                   | 239,033                                  | 8.68                                     | (9.81)                                   | 265,036                                  | 9.59                                     | 2.36                                     |\n| Voluntary automobile                | 1,230,897                                | 44.68                                    | 2.57                                     | 1,200,041                                | 43.42                                    | 1.29                                     |\n| Compulsory automobile liability     | 238,263                                  | 8.65                                     | (15.48)                                  | 281,885                                  | 10.20                                    | (0.43)                                   |\n| Others                              | 488,379                                  | 17.73                                    | 2.01                                     | 478,778                                  | 17.32                                    | 2.85                                     |\n| Total                               | 2,754,954                                | 100.00                                   | (0.32)                                   | 2,763,830                                | 100.00                                   | 3.25                                     |\n| Deposit premiums from policyholders | 65,122                                   | 2.36                                     | (15.47)                                  | 77,041                                   | 2.79                                     | (4.41)                                   |\n\n- Note: 1.

Cash Flows\n\nCash flows for the fiscal year 2020 were as follows:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by 180.2 billion yen to 1,177.8 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly due to a decrease in paid claims. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 1,815.4 billion yen to 731.0 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in purchases of securities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 2,056.0 billion yen to 512.9 billion yen, mainly due to a decrease in changes in cash collateral under securities lending transactions for procurement of funds.\n\nAs a result, Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year was 924.6 billion yen, a decrease of 96.4 billion yen from that as of March 31, 2020.\n\n## 3.

Scope of consolidation\n\n- (1) Number of consolidated companies: 175 companies\n\nFor details of the Company's major consolidated subsidiaries, please refer to \"Tokio Marine Holdings and its Subsidiaries\" in \"Corporate Data\".\n\nAcorn Advisory Capital L.P. and 10 other companies are included in the scope of consolidation from the fiscal year 2020 due to the acquisition of shares.\n\n## (2) Names of major non-consolidated subsidiaries\n\n(Names of major companies)\n\n- \u00b7 Tokio Marine & Nichido Adjusting Service Co., Ltd.\n- \u00b7 Tokio Marine Life Insurance (Thailand) Public Company Limited\n\n## (Reason for exclusion from the scope of consolidation)\n\nEach non-consolidated subsidiary is small in scale in terms of total assets, sales, net income or loss and retained earnings. As such non-consolidated subsidiaries are not considered to materially affect any reasonable determination as to the Group's financial condition and results of operations, these companies are excluded from the consolidation.\n\n## 2. Application of the equity method\n\n- (1) Number of affiliates accounted for by the equity method: 7 companies\n\nFor details of major affiliates accounted for by the equity method, please refer to \"Tokio Marine Holdings and its Subsidiaries\" in \"Corporate Data\".\n\n- (2) The non-consolidated subsidiaries (Tokio Marine & Nichido Adjusting Service Co., Ltd., Tokio Marine Life Insurance (Thailand) Public Company Limited, etc.) and other affiliates (Alinma Tokio Marine Company, etc.) are not accounted for by the equity method because these companies have an immaterial effect on the Company's consolidated net income or loss as well as consolidated retained earnings.\n- (3) The Company owns 30.1% of the total voting rights of Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co., Ltd. through Tokio Marine & Nichido and Nisshin Fire. However, the Company does not consider Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co., Ltd. to be its affiliate since it cannot exert a significant influence on any decision making of its policies given the highly public nature of their business.\n- (4) When a company accounted for by the equity method has a different closing date from that of the Company, in principle, the financial statements prepared at its closing date are used for presentation in the consolidated financial results.\n\n## 3. Balance sheet date of consolidated subsidiaries\n\nThere are three domestic subsidiaries and 163 overseas subsidiaries whose balance sheet dates are December 31. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of these subsidiaries for the period ended December 31. Necessary adjustments for the consolidation are made for material transactions that occur during the three-month lag between the balance sheet dates of these subsidiaries and the consolidated balance sheet date.\n\n## 4. Accounting policies\n\n## (1) Accounting for insurance contracts\n\nAccounting for insurance contracts such as insurance premiums, outstanding claims and underwriting reserves of domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries is stipulated under Insurance Business Act and other laws and regulations.\n\n## (2) Valuation of securities\n\n- a.  Trading securities are valued at fair value, with the costs of their sales being calculated based on the moving-average method.\n- b.  Bonds held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost based on the moving-average method (straight-line method).\n- c.  Bonds earmarked for underwriting reserves are stated at amortized cost under the straight-line method in accordance with the Industry Audit Committee Report No. 21 \"Temporary Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Securities Earmarked for Underwriting Reserve in Insurance Industry\" issued by the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the \"JICPA\"), November 16, 2000.\n\nThe following is a summary of the risk management policy concerning bonds earmarked for underwriting reserves. In order to adequately manage interest rate risk related to assets and liabilities, Tokio Marine & Nichido Life has established \"part of underwriting reserve for individual insurance policies (non-participating or participating)\" as an underwriting reserve subgroup. Tokio Marine & Nichido Life's policy is to match the duration of the underwriting reserve in the subgroup with the same or similar duration of bonds that are earmarked for underwriting reserves.\n\n- d.  Available-for-sale securities with fair value are measured at fair value mainly based upon the market price on the closing date. Unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net assets and costs of sales are calculated using the moving-average method.\n- e.  Available-for-sale securities whose fair value cannot be measured reliably are stated at original cost by the moving-average method.\n- f. Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates that are not subject to the equity method are stated at original cost by the moving-average method.\n- g.  Securities held in individually managed money trusts that are mainly invested in securities for trading are measured at fair value.\n\n## (3) Valuation of derivative transactions\n\nDerivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.\n\n## (4) Depreciation methods for material depreciable assets\n\n- a.  Tangible fixed assets\n\nDepreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method.\n\n- b.  Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets recognized in acquisitions of overseas subsidiaries are amortized over the estimated useful life reflecting\n\nthe pattern of the assets' future economic benefits.\n\n## (5) Accounting policies for significant reserves and allowances\n\n## a.  Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nIn order to prepare for losses from bad debts, allowances are provided pursuant to the rules of asset self-assessment and the rules of asset write-off. Allowances are provided by major domestic consolidated subsidiaries as follows.\n\nFor receivables from any debtor who has legally, or in practice, become insolvent (due to bankruptcy, special liquidation or suspension of transactions with banks based on the rules governing clearing houses, etc.) and for receivables from any debtor who has substantially become insolvent, allowances are provided based on the amount of any such receivables less the amount expected to be collectible, calculated based on the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees.\n\nFor receivables from any debtor who is likely to become insolvent in the near future, allowances are provided based on the amount of any such receivables less the amount expected to be collectible through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees and the overall solvency assessment of the relevant debtor.\n\nFor receivables other than those described above, allowances are the amount of receivables multiplied by the default rate, which is calculated based on historical default experience in certain previous periods.\n\nIn addition, all receivables are assessed by the asset accounting department and the asset management department in accordance with the rules of asset self-assessment. Subsequently, the asset auditing departments, which are independent from other asset-related departments, conduct audits of the assessment results of the other asset-related departments. Allowances are provided based on such assessment results as stated above.\n\n## b.  Provision for employees' bonus\n\nTo provide for payment of bonuses to employees, the Company and its major consolidated domestic subsidiaries recognize provisions for employees' bonuses based on the expected amount to be paid.\n\n- c.  Reserve for price fluctuation Domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries recognize reserves in accordance with Article 115 of the Insurance Business Act in\n\norder to provide for possible losses or damages arising from fluctuation of share prices, etc.\n\n## (6) Accounting methods for retirement benefits\n\n- a.  The method of attributing expected retirement benefits to periods\n- In calculating the retirement benefit obligations, the method of attributing expected retirement benefits to periods is based on the benefit formula basis.\n- b.  The method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses and past service costs Actuarial gains and losses for each fiscal year are amortized proportionally from the following fiscal year using the straight-line method over a certain number of years (5 to 13 years) within the average remaining work period of employees at the time of\n\noccurrence.\n\nPast service costs are amortized by the straight-line method over a certain number of years (7 to 13 years) within the average remaining work period of employees at the time of occurrence.\n\n## (7) Consumption taxes\n\nFor the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, consumption taxes are accounted for by the tax-excluded method except for costs such as Operating and general administrative expenses incurred by domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries which are accounted for by the tax-included method.\n\nIn addition, any non-deductible consumption taxes, in respect of assets, are included in other assets and are amortized over five years using the straight-line method.",

        "page_content": "## (8) Hedge accounting\n\n## a.  Interest rate\n\nTo mitigate interest rate fluctuation risks associated with long-term insurance policies, Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido Life conduct Asset Liability Management (\"ALM\") to control such risks by evaluating and analyzing financial assets and insurance liabilities simultaneously.\n\nAs for interest rate swap transactions that are used to manage such risks, Tokio Marine & Nichido and Tokio Marine & Nichido Life apply deferred hedge accounting to the swap transactions based upon the Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 26, \"Accounting and Auditing Treatments related to Application of Accounting for Financial Instruments in the Insurance Industry\" (issued by the JICPA, March 25, 2021).\n\nAssessment of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the companies group hedged insurance liabilities with the interest rate swaps that are the hedging instruments, based on the period remaining for the instruments, and the hedge is highly effective.\n\n## b.  Foreign exchange\n\nMajor domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries apply fair value hedge accounting, deferred hedge accounting or assignment accounting for certain foreign exchange forwards and certain currency swaps utilized to reduce future currency risk such as in assets denominated in foreign currency. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the principal terms of the hedging instruments and the hedged items are identical, and the hedge is highly effective.\n\n## (9) Methods and periods of amortization of goodwill\n\nRegarding goodwill recognized as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet, goodwill in connection with Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill in connection with HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. is amortized over 10 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill in connection with Privilege Underwriters, Inc. is amortized over 15 years using the straight-line method. Other goodwill is amortized over 5 to 15 years using the straight-line method. Other goodwill in small amounts is amortized immediately.\n\nNegative goodwill incurred before March 31, 2010 and recognized as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method.\n\n## (10) Scope of cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments such as time deposits with original maturities or redemption of three months or less at the date of acquisition.\n\n## Significant Accounting Estimates\n\nItems including accounting estimates that could have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are as follows:\n\n## 1. Outstanding claims\n\n- (1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021 Outstanding claims 3,157,123 million yen\n\n## (2) Information on the significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.  Calculation method\n- Outstanding claims is estimated as the amount of claims, refunds and other benefits (hereinafter referred to as \"Claims\") deemed\n\nto have resulted in an obligation under an insurance contract that have not yet been paid.\n\n- b.  Key assumptions used in the calculations Outstanding claims is estimated based on the ultimate settlement of Claims by using the assumptions calculated mainly from historical payment experience.\n- c.  Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n- Due to the revision of laws and regulations or court decisions, etc., the ultimate settlement of Insurance Claims may change from the initial estimate, and the amount recorded for outstanding claims may increase or decrease.\n\n## 2. Impairment of goodwill\n\n(1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021\n\nGoodwill\n\n485,682 million yen\n\n## (2) Information on the significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.  Calculation method\n\nImpairment of goodwill is recognized mainly in accordance with the procedures for identifying indications of impairment, assessing the recognition of an impairment loss and measuring an impairment loss for each unit to which goodwill is attributed (hereinafter referred to as \"Reporting unit\") whose performance is reported independently for the Company's management purpose.\n\nFirst, for each Reporting unit, the Company assesses if indications of impairment are identified, such as deterioration in the latest operating results and future prospects, a significant negative deviation compared to the business plan at the time of acquisition, or significant adverse changes in the business environment including market conditions. For Reporting units for which indications of impairment were identified, an impairment loss is recognized if the total amount of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of goodwill. For Reporting units for which recognition of an impairment loss is deemed necessary, the book value of goodwill shall be reduced to the recoverable amount which is calculated by discounting future cash flows, and recognizes the reduced amount as impairment loss.\n\n- b.  Key assumptions for the calculations\n\nFuture cash flows and discount rates are used to calculate impairment loss on goodwill.\n\nFuture cash flows are estimated based on the latest rational business plan, taking into account the growth, etc., based on the business environment of each reporting unit.\n\nThe discount rate is the pre-tax interest rate, which is the cost of capital plus necessary adjustments such as interest rate differentials.\n\n- c.  Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n\nAn impairment loss may be incurred if undiscounted future cash flows significantly decline due to, for example, a significant deterioration in profitability from the assumption at the time of acquisition and a significant downward deviation from the business plan.\n\n## 3. Valuation of financial instruments\n\n- (1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021 Please refer to \"Information on Financial Instruments\".\n\n## (2) Information on significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.  Calculation method\n\nWith regards to the calculation method of the fair value of financial instruments, please refer to \"Information on Financial Instruments-2. Fair value of financial instruments (Note 1)\".\n\n- b.  Key assumptions for the calculations\n\nThe fair values of financial instruments with no quoted market prices are calculated using assumptions such as yield curves on certain bases.\n\n- c.  Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n- Key assumptions may change due to changes in the market condition, and the fair value of financial instruments may increase or decrease.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n06",

        "page_content": "## Information on Financial Instruments\n\n## 1. Qualitative information on financial instruments\n\n## (1) Investment policies\n\nThe core operation of the Group is its insurance business, and it invests utilizing the cash inflows mainly arising from insurance premiums. Therefore, the Group seeks to appropriately control risks based on the characteristics of insurance products primarily through ALM. We thereby aim to ensure stable, long-term earnings while realizing efficient management of liquidity.\n\nSpecifically, our approach entails controlling interest rate risks associated with insurance liabilities by utilizing interest rate swaps and other transactions while assuming a certain degree of credit risks by investing in bonds with high credit ratings. At the same time, we endeavor to ensure medium-to-long-term earnings by diversifying risks and asset management approaches in Japan and overseas through the utilization of a wide range of products including foreign securities and alternative investments. Foreign exchange forwards and other derivative transactions are used to mitigate risks associated with the Company's asset portfolio. The Group also utilizes financial options as one of the ways to control risks related to variable annuities which guarantee minimum amounts of benefits which are not subject to the result of investment.\n\nThrough these approaches, the Group aims to increase investment income in order to maximize net asset value in the medium-tolong-term and maintain financial soundness.\n\nWith regard to financing, the Group issues corporate bonds and undertakes borrowings mainly to secure funds for investments. When financing is necessary, amounts and methodologies are determined based on the Group's cash flow status.\n\n## (2) Details of financial instruments and their risk\n\nThe Group holds financial instruments including equity securities, bonds, other securities, loans and derivatives. These instruments are exposed to market risk, which refers to the risk of losses arising from fluctuations in stock prices, exchange rates, interest rates, and other market indicators. They are also exposed to credit risk, which refers to the risk of losses when the value of an investment declines or is lost due to deterioration in the financial condition of the debtor. Other risks to which these instruments are exposed include market liquidity risk, which refers to the risk of losses that may occur from being unable to make transactions due to disorderly market conditions or being forced to make transactions at extremely unfavorable prices.\n\nSome currency risk is hedged through foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps and other such transactions. Hedge accounting is applied to some of these transactions.\n\nCredit risk associated with derivative transactions includes the risk of losses when the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations due to insolvency or for other reasons. In order to reduce such credit risk, netting arrangements may be used with financial institutions and other counterparties with whom there are frequent transactions. Also, interest rate risk associated with long-term insurance liabilities is hedged by interest rate swaps and other transactions for which hedge accounting is applied in some cases.\n\nWith regard to hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policies and evaluation of hedge effectiveness, please refer to \"Significant Accounting Policies - 4. Accounting policies - (8) Hedge accounting\".\n\n## (3) Risk management structure\n\n## (i) Market risk and credit risk management\n\nBased on the \"Investment risk management policy\" established by the Board of Directors, Tokio Marine & Nichido executes risk management activities both quantitatively and qualitatively to control investment risk related to financial instruments, such as market risk and credit risk, at the risk management department, which is independent of trading departments.\n\nIn accordance with the policy, \"Investment guidelines\" are established, which set the rules for which instruments to invest in, risk limits, and actions to take when limits are exceeded for each segment set in the annual investment plan. Investment risk is quantitatively measured using VaR-like concepts. Compliance with the guidelines and investment risk and return are reported on a regular basis to directors.\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido appropriately manages credit risk by regularly monitoring the concentration and the status of issuers and borrowers using internal credit rating guidelines set by the \"Guidelines for managing credit risk concentration\".\n\nIn order to control individual investments, Tokio Marine & Nichido also executes pre-investment review and post-investment monitoring according to the \"Review guidelines\" and others.\n\nRisk monitoring operations are reported to the Board of Directors depending on their importance.\n\nOther consolidated subsidiaries maintain risk management structures based on the aforementioned risks.\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by controlling payment schedules and ensuring various ways of financing through treasury management by each consolidated subsidiary and by the Group as a whole.\n\n## (4) Supplementary information on fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is calculated in commonly used and recognized methodologies when market prices are not available.

For securities with no quoted market price, the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is applied as the fair value.\n\nWith regard to floating rate loans in (7) Loans, the book value is deemed as the fair value because the change in interest rate will be reflected in a timely manner in the future cash flows and the book value approximates the fair value as long as there are no significant changes in the credit status of the borrowers since the inception of the loans. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is measured as the net present value of estimated future cash flows. For loans of which borrowers are insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings, the fair value is measured by deducting the estimated uncollectible debts from the carrying amount.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nWith regard to (1) Corporate bonds, the price of the over-the-counter transactions is the fair value.\n\nWith regard to (2) Payables under securities lending transactions, the book value is deemed as the fair value because it is scheduled to be settled in a short period of time and the book value approximates the fair value.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nPlease refer to \"Derivative Transactions\".\n\n(Note 2) Carrying amount shown on balance sheet of financial instruments for which fair value cannot be measured reliably\n\n|                                                                                         | As of March 31, 2021   | As of March 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Investment in non-consolidated subsidiaries, unlisted stock and partnership investments | 315,603                | 321,277                |\n| Policy loans                                                                            | 117,193                | 127,827                |\n| Total                                                                                   | 432,797                | 449,104                |\n\n(Yen in millions)\n\nInvestment in non-consolidated subsidiaries, unlisted stock and partnership investments are not included in (6) Securities, because the fair value cannot be measured reliably, as they have no quoted market price and the future cash flow cannot be estimated.\n\nPolicy loans are not included in (7) Loans, because the future cash flows cannot be estimated since policy loans are arranged under an insurance policy and the amount is limited to the repayment fund for cancellation with no contractual maturity.\n\n(Note 3) Maturity analysis of financial assets\n\n## As of March 31, 2021\n\n|                                             | Within 1 year   | Over 1 to 5 years   | Over 5 to 10 years   | Over 10 years   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Cash and bank deposits                      | 131,972         | 8,915               | -

Most subsidiaries in Tokio Marine Group engage in non-life insurance business, life insurance business and Small Amount and Short Term insurance business. In addition to reserves to cover claim payments, payments for maturity refunds of saving type insurance policies, etc., it is necessary for insurance groups to maintain sufficient solvency in order to cover risks that exceed normal estimates, e.g. occurrences of a major catastrophe, or a significant decline in value of assets held by insurance groups.\n- 2. (C) Solvency margin ratio is the ratio of (A) Total amount of solvency margin (i.e. solvency of insurance company groups in terms of their capital, reserves, etc.) to (B) Total amount of risks (i.e. risks that exceed normal estimates) which is calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Act.\n- 3. \"Risks that exceed normal estimates\" is composed of risks described below.\n- (1) General insurance risk on non-life insurance contracts, life insurance risk, third sector insurance risk and insurance risk of Small Amount and Short Term Insurers: risk that insurance claims occur in excess of normal estimates excluding catastrophe risk on non-life insurance contracts.\n- (2) Assumed interest rate risk: risk that invested assets fail to yield assumed interest rates due to factors such as downturn of investment conditions.\n- (3) Minimum guarantee risk on life insurance contracts: risk that value of assets related to the minimum guarantee for benefits of insurance contracts, which are managed as a separate account, fluctuates in excess of normal estimates and falls below the minimum guaranteed benefits when they are to be paid.\n- (4) Asset management risk: risk that the prices of retained securities and other assets fluctuate in excess of normal estimates.\n- (5) Business administration risk: risk that occurs in excess of normal estimates and does not fall under other categories.\n- (6) Catastrophe risk on non-life insurance contracts: risk that a major catastrophe in excess of normal estimates which is equivalent to the Great Kanto Earthquake or Isewan Typhoon or overseas major catastrophe occurs.\n- 4. Subsidiaries that were excluded from the scope of consolidation in preparation of the consolidated financial statements due to immateriality were included within the calculation of the consolidated solvency margin ratio.\n- 5. Solvency of insurance company groups in terms of their capital, reserves, etc. ((A) Total amount of solvency margin) is the total amount of net assets excluding planned outflows, certain reserves (e.g. price fluctuation reserve, contingency reserve, catastrophe loss reserve, etc.) and part of unrealized gains (losses) on land, etc.\n- 6. Solvency margin ratio on a consolidated basis is one of the objective indicators used by the regulatory authority to supervise corporate groups headed by an insurance holdings company. A ratio exceeding 200% indicates sufficient solvency to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims.\n\n## Sufficiency of solvency of major domestic subsidiaries to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims\n\n## Solvency margin ratio (non-consolidated) for Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | (Yen in millions)    | (Yen in millions)    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                           | As of March 31, 2021 | As of March 31, 2020 |\n| (A) Total amount of solvency margin                                                                                                       | 5,222,262            | 4,681,376            |\n| Shareholders' equity less adjusting items                                                                                                 | 1,343,538            | 1,383,131            |\n| Reserve for price fluctuation                                                                                                             | 109,013              | 102,874              |\n| Contingency reserve                                                                                                                       | 6,623                | 6,213                |\n| Catastrophe loss reserve                                                                                                                  | 981,590              | 913,540              |\n| General allowance for doubtful accounts                                                                                                   | 256                  | 196                  |\n| Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and deferred gains (losses) on hedge transactions before tax effect deductions | 1,933,277            | 1,424,499            |\n| Unrealized gains (losses) on land                                                                                                         | 243,088              | 230,253              |\n| Excess of policyholders' contract deposits                                                                                                | -

In addition to reserves to cover claim payments, payments for maturity refunds of saving type insurance policies, etc., it is necessary for insurance companies to maintain sufficient solvency in order to cover risks that exceed normal estimates, e.g. occurrences of a major catastrophe, a significant decline in value of assets held by insurance companies.\n- 2. (C) Solvency margin ratio is the ratio of (A) Total amount of solvency margin (i.e. solvency of insurance companies in terms of their capital, reserves, etc.) to (B) Total amount of risks (i.e. risks that exceed normal estimates), which is calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Act.\n- 3. \"Risks that exceed normal estimates\" is composed of risks described below.\n- (1) (General) insurance risk, third sector insurance risk: risk that insurance claims occur in excess of normal estimates excluding catastrophe risk.\n- (2) Assumed interest rate risk: risk that invested assets fail to yield assumed interest rates due to factors such as downturn of investment conditions.\n- (3) Minimum guarantee risk: risk that value of assets related to the minimum guarantee for benefits of insurance contracts, which are managed as a separate account, fluctuates in excess of normal estimates and falls below the minimum guaranteed benefits when they are to be paid.\n- (4) Asset management risk: risk that prices of retained securities and other assets fluctuate in excess of normal estimates.\n- (5) Business administration risk: risk that occurs in excess of normal estimates and does not fall under other categories.\n- (6) Catastrophe risk: risk that a major catastrophe in excess of normal estimates which is equivalent to the Great Kanto Earthquake or Isewan typhoon occurs.\n- 4. Solvency of insurance companies in terms of their capital, reserves, etc. ((A) Total amount of solvency margin) is the total amount of net assets excluding planned outflows, certain reserves (e.g. reserve for price fluctuation, contingency reserve, catastrophe loss reserve, etc.) and part of unrealized gains (losses) on land, etc.\n- 5. Solvency margin ratio is one of the objective indicators used by the regulators to supervise insurance companies. A ratio exceeding 200% indicates sufficient solvency to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims.\n\n## Solvency margin ratio (non-consolidated) for Nisshin Fire & Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\n(Yen in millions)\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | As of March 31, 2021   | As of March 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| (A) Total amount of solvency margin                                                                                                       | 146,730                | 144,640                |\n| Shareholders' equity less adjusting items                                                                                                 | 57,977                 | 51,999                 |\n| Reserve for price fluctuation                                                                                                             | 1,924                  | 1,732                  |\n| Contingency reserve                                                                                                                       | -

TMNL has been disclosing its EV in compliance with the MCEV Principles to enhance the disclosure since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\n\n## MCEV as of March 31, 2021\n\n## 1. MCEV as of March 31, 2021\n\nMCEV of TMNL as of March 31, 2021, was 1,177.3 billion yen, a increase of 186.8 billion yen from the previous fiscal year end (March 31, 2020), mainly due to economic variances of (128.2) billion yen.MCEV consisted of 854.6 billion yen of adjusted net worth and (322.7) billion yen of value of in-force.\n\n|                         | (Billions of yen)   | (Billions of yen)   | (Billions of yen)   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                         | FY2020              | FY2019              | FY2018              |\n| Adjusted net worth      | 854.6               | 1,113.0             | 1,119.5             |\n| Value of in-force       | 322.7               | (122.4)             | (43.5)              |\n| MCEV at fiscal year-end | 1,177.3             | 990.5               | 1,076.0             |\n| New business value      | 55.0                | 37.3                | 59.5                |\n\n## MCEV at Fiscal Year-End\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Change in MCEV\n\nDuring FY2020, the change in MCEV (before dividends paid) was (205.2) billion yen, which was an increase on 275.6 billion yen from the previous fiscal year change in MCEV (FY2019). This was mainly due to economic variances of (132.4) billion yen resulting from a rise in yen interest rates in FY2020, and rebound from the yen interest rate declined in the previous year, compared to economic variances of (128.2) billion yen in FY2019.

Risk-Free Rates\n\nWe have used government bond yields as of the end of March 2021.\n\nThe Company has made sets to the method of 1-year forward rate of government bonds in the 41st year and thereafter, assuming that adjustments were carried out based on the past yield fluctuations in the 40-year spot rate.We have adjusted and used Bloomberg's government bond yields as our data source.The government bond yields (spot rates) for key terms are shown below.\n\nJPY\n\n| Term     | End of March 2021   | End of March 2020   |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1 year   | (0.12%)             | (0.14%)             |\n| 5 years  | (0.09%)             | (0.12%)             |\n| 10 years | 0.11%               | 0.04%               |\n| 20 years | 0.51%               | 0.35%               |\n| 30 years | 0.70%               | 0.45%               |\n| 40 years | 0.71%               | 0.44%               |\n| 50 years | 0.80%               | 0.53%               |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in P.186 presented the impact of changing the extrapolation of JPY-interest rates beyond the 40th year to use an ultimate forward rate (UFR) method. This UFR method entails setting the JPY ultimate forward rate to 3.8%, extrapolating rates from year 30,and applying the Smith-Wilson method so that forward rates from the 31st year onwards approach to the UFR in 30 years. This method was established with reference to the global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) currently in development by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Representative JPY interest rates are as follows:\n\nJPY\n\n| Term     | End of March 2021   |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| 1 year   | (0.12%)             |\n| 5 years  | (0.09%)             |\n| 10 years | 0.11%               |\n| 20 years | 0.51%               |\n| 30 years | 0.70%               |\n| 40 years | 1.15%               |\n| 50 years | 1.64%               |\n\nWe have not included a liquidity premium in the risk-free rates given that definitions in the MCEV Principles are not clear and generally accepted practice has not yet been established. Negative interest rates are not floored at zero.\n\n## 2.

For policy years with no experience data, assumptions are developed with reference to industry data. We have reflected improvement trends for mortality rates and improving trends or deteriorating trends for A&H  morbidity rates of some benefits. The projection period for which these trends are reflected is limited to 5  years.                                                                                                 |\n| Surrender and lapse rates     | Surrender and lapse rates are developed based on the experience of the most recent year, in principle, by line of business, premium mode, and policy year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Renewal rates                 | Renewal rates are developed based on past experience. Policies for which renewals are projected are A&H products, whose impact is large due to a high number of limited term in-force policies. For the sake of simplicity, we have not reflected future renewals for some riders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Operating expense rates       | ordinarily expected to be incurred in future periods. The removed one-off cost is 600 million yen, which is tied  primarily to a portion of system development costs. And with regard to system development costs for policy  acquisition and maintenance, and the information technology device costs for policy maintenance, the  average amount incurred over the past five years is reflected in the corresponding unit costs.
