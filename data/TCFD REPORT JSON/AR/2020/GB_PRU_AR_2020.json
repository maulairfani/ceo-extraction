        "page_content": "While the pandemic continues to have an impact, many of our markets are starting to ease social distancing restrictions, demand for our services remains strong, and the long-term opportunities for growth remain as compelling as ever.\n\nOur people have responded to the challenges of Covid-19 with purpose, dedication and innovation. Often under great pressure, they/uni00A0have found creative new ways of meeting the needs of customers and wider stakeholders. I would like to thank the Group's management led by Mike Wells, and our employees, agents, partners and suppliers for their efforts and achievements.\n\nAs Mike sets out in his report, these efforts translated into a resilient financial performance and, guided by Prudential's new dividend policy announced in August 2020, the Board has approved a 2020 second interim ordinary dividend of 10.73 cents per share.\n\n## Accelerating structural transformation\n\nOur business is at a pivotal moment. Prudential has already gone through significant structural change with the 2019 demerger of our UK and European operations, M&G plc. In January 2021, the Board announced its intention to separate Jackson, our US business, through/uni00A0a demerger in the second quarter of 2021 and we continue to/uni00A0make good progress towards the completion of this transaction. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0standalone business, we expect Jackson to pursue a focused strategy which prioritises optimisation and stability of capital resources/uni00A0while protecting franchise value.\n\nJackson's separation will complete Prudential's transformation from a diversified, global group into a focused business exclusively targeting the fast-growing health, protection and savings opportunities of Asia and Africa.\n\nIn order to enhance financial flexibility and de-lever the balance sheet, Prudential is considering raising new equity of around $2.5-3 billion following the completion of the Jackson demerger. Our preferred route is a fully marketed global offering to institutional investors concurrent with a public offering in Hong Kong to retail investors. As an Asiafocused company, the Group believes there are clear benefits from increasing both its Asian shareholder base and the liquidity of its shares in Hong Kong. The allocation of any offering will take into account a number of criteria including the interests of existing shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nPrudential benefits from a rare combination of rising unmet consumer need for its services, hard-to-replicate capabilities, and a strong sense of purpose and business strategy that flow organically from each other.\n\nIn Asia, people are growing more prosperous and populations are ageing. By 2040, the region is expected to account for over half of global GDP 1 , with the number of people over 65 years old reaching 750 million 2 . These structural trends are increasing the need for financial protection and long-term savings. However, people remain under-insured, with four out of every 10 US dollars spent on health still settled out of pocket. While people need to save more in order to be able to live well throughout their longer lives, the investment industry in much of Asia is in its early stages of development. Mutual fund penetration - the ratio of total funds invested versus GDP - is more than 100 per cent in the United States, but below a third of that level in South-east Asia, and significantly lower in some markets in the region.\n\nPrudential has built top-three positions in nine Asian life insurance markets, with significant upside potential in the region's two largest markets, China and India, where we operate in conjunction with local partners. Our distribution network is deep and broad, with around 600,000 agents 3 , access to around 20,000 bank branches, and innovative new digital partnerships. We create products to serve the needs of everyone from those seeking low-cost policies for specific purposes to the emerging middle class and affluent families requiring more holistic financial planning advice. We are also East Asia's leading Islamic life insurer and have a growing business serving small and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of Asia's economic success. These capabilities have helped our Asia embedded value to more than double in the past five years to $44 billion.\n\nPrudential has invested and innovated to adapt to evolving consumer needs. Eastspring, our Asia asset manager, which has top-10 positions in seven markets, serves the needs both of Asian savers and of global investors seeking access to Asian opportunities. Pulse, our new digital platform, is an end-to-end tool for/uni00A0agent management and client fulfilment, being rolled out 4 in 15 markets in Asia and Africa in 11 languages. Our investment in Africa gives us exposure to a growing, under-served continent whose population is expected to double to more than two billion people by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our people\n\nOur people, and their ability to work with agility and innovation, are/uni00A0another important source of competitive advantage. Over 2020, we launched 175 new products 5 . This/uni00A0pace of progress requires the collaboration of people with varied experiences and skills, and the promotion of a culture of inclusion has become an increasing area of/uni00A0attention for the management and Board.\n\nWe recognise that the efforts made by our people, while adapting to virtual working and the broader pressures of the pandemic, can place a/uni00A0strain on their wellbeing. This was a focus of the Board and its employee engagement directors, Kai Nargolwala for Asia/uni00A0and Africa and Tom Watjen for the US and UK, whose activities in/uni00A0this area are summarised on page 79. To understand better both the anxieties and/uni00A0the ambitions of our people, a series of listening exercises were conducted, including our largest-ever employee survey and an online/uni00A0'Collaboration Jam' that saw more than 5,000 people make contributions. Informed by this feedback, practical initiatives were put/uni00A0in place to support people's mental health and work-life balance. In/uni00A02021, with Covid-19 continuing to impact lives and working patterns in many markets, these themes will continue to be a key area for Board/uni00A0consideration.",

Furthermore, as an owner and manager of assets, focused on delivering strong returns over the long term, we understand the importance of playing an active role in the transition to a lowercarbon/uni00A0future.\n\nOver the past year, to reinforce this linkage between our business model and our purpose, we have refreshed our environmental, social and/uni00A0governance (ESG) strategy. This will now focus on three priorities: making health and financial security accessible; stewarding the human/uni00A0impacts of climate change; and building social capital through developing a culture of inclusion, and digital responsibility. The Board is committed to working with management to ensure that these priorities are placed at the heart of how we do business.\n\nIn January 2021, the Board established for the period up to the 2022 Annual Meeting a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, to/uni00A0be chaired by Alice Schroeder. This will oversee the embedding of/uni00A0the new ESG framework and progress on diversity and inclusion initiatives and will take on employee engagement activities. You can find more information in the ESG section of this report starting on page/uni00A070 and on our website: prudentialplc.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Board\n\nMy predecessor, Paul Manduca, stepped down on 31 December 2020 after eight years as Chairman. I would like to thank him for the way he skilfully helped navigate the Group through this period of substantial change and for the generous way in which he supported me personally during the period of transition. Also during 2020 we saw the departure of Sir Howard Davies from the Board after almost ten years as a Non-executive Director and Chair of the Risk Committee, with Jeremy Anderson succeeding him as Chair of that committee. At the 2021 annual general meeting, Kai Nargolwala will step down as a Non-executive Director after nine years on the Board. Sir Howard and/uni00A0Kai made significant contributions to the work of the Board and/uni00A0they leave with our gratitude.\n\nThe Board needs to evolve to keep pace with the Group's future as an/uni00A0exclusively Asian and African business and its increasing focus on digital capabilities. To this end, in February 2021 we announced the appointments of Chua Sock Koong and Ming Lu, who will both join the/uni00A0Board as Non-executive Directors on 1 May 2021. They bring extensive experience of successfully investing in, growing and leading businesses across Asia.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWhile the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain as the world continues to manage through the pandemic, the underlying, long-term drivers of the demand for the products and services we can/uni00A0provide remain clear and strong. Technologies such as machine learning, combined with growing digital connectivity, are enabling substantial leaps in the development of financial services, while consumer preferences are evolving rapidly, in some areas spurred on/uni00A0by the pandemic. The pace at which Prudential adapted to the operational challenges created by the Covid-19 pandemic gives me confidence in our ability to harness these changes, and to continue to/uni00A0grow in Asia and Africa, addressing unmet health, protection and savings needs.\n\nI very much look forward to playing my part in this transformation and/uni00A0working with all of you to realise our ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shriti Vadera\n\nChair of the Board\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Source: McKinsey - Asia's future is now, July 2019.\n- 2 Source: Euromonitor International - Three Out of The/uni00A0World's Top Five Oldest Populations Will Be in Asia by 2040, November 2020.

Our wide range of innovative products, diverse and flexible approach to distribution, and relentless focus on operating efficiency enabled us/uni00A0to continue to operate profitably, and at the same time continue to/uni00A0invest heavily in organic and inorganic growth initiatives.\n\nIn 2020 we focused on three areas of activity. First, we have been/uni00A0meeting the urgent needs of our customers, colleagues and communities in light of the pandemic. Second, we advanced the pace/uni00A0and the extent of our plans in delivering more digitally enabled, scalable operations, and equipping us with the tools necessary for continued success in the future. This had the effect of enabling us to/uni00A0execute effectively during lockdown restrictions. Third, we accelerated the structural repositioning of the Group, in particular enlarging our footprint in the Asian markets with the most attractive structural opportunities, and working at pace towards the proposed separation of our US business, Jackson.\n\n## D E\n\n## Supporting stakeholders through the pandemic\n\nWe have been working hard to support all our stakeholders throughout the year. For our customers, for our colleagues and distributors, and for the communities in which we work, we have introduced a range of innovative measures to both deal with the impact/uni00A0of the virus and provide the means for them to emerge in a/uni00A0stronger position once the effect of the virus has subsided.\n\nFor our customers, we have put in place measures to increase coverage during this difficult time and to mitigate financial stress resulting from the virus. In most of our markets we introduced free limited-time Covid-19 cover, and we made improvements to our offerings throughout the year, including providing cash relief upon diagnosis and hospitalisation, and paying out on death.\n\nWe have enabled our colleagues around the world to work remotely and have undertaken a number of new initiatives to find out about and respond to their concerns, in particular managing the risk of mental and physical health challenges of staff and their families. During the course of the year, we have ensured that our people working from home have had the necessary equipment and support to do their work/uni00A0safely and comfortably. With disruption to working patterns continuing into 2021, we are taking further measures to help colleagues manage the longer-term psychological strains of remote working by providing as much flexibility as possible, and offering sessions and support for psychological and physical wellbeing.\n\nWe also took a number of key steps throughout the year to support our distributors through the challenges presented by Covid-19. To support our agents, we worked with regulators in 2020 to virtualise the sales process, and 28 per cent of agency new cases since April 2020, where/uni00A0we focused our efforts initially, together with 27 per cent of bancassurance new cases since July 2020, have been made virtually. This compares with very low amounts in prior years. Our Mainland China joint venture, CITIC-Prudential, went a step further by creating a virtual reality 'meeting room' where clients can purchase our products.\n\nIn the communities in which we work, we launched a number of initiatives to provide support through the challenges of Covid-19 and beyond. In May we launched the Prudential Covid-19 Relief Fund to provide financial support for communities and for the volunteering efforts of our people in Asia, the US and Africa. The fund is being distributed among our markets around the world to support charitable/uni00A0and community projects tackling the immediate impact of/uni00A0the pandemic and its social and economic consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Delivering on long-term strategic goals\n\nWe have had two key strategic objectives in 2020. The first has been/uni00A0to/uni00A0deliver the proposed separation of our US business, Jackson. The second has been to enable our shareholders to benefit to the maximum extent from the health, financial protection and savings opportunities in our chosen markets in Asia and Africa, while ensuring that we deliver more digitally enabled, scalable operations in those regions to position us well for future success.\n\nIn the US we are now able to provide clarity on the path and timing of Jackson's proposed separation. In January 2021 the Group announced an update on Jackson's capital position and that it had decided to pursue the separation of Jackson from the Group through a demerger, whereby shares in Jackson would be distributed to Prudential shareholders. Subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, the/uni00A0planned demerger is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021, and would lead to a significantly earlier separation of Jackson from the Group than would have been possible through a minority IPO/uni00A0and future sell-downs, which from market precedent may have lasted until 2023. This accelerated process will complete Prudential's structural shift from a diversified global group to a growth business focusing exclusively on the unmet health, financial protection and savings needs of people in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn order to accelerate de-levering during 2021 through the redemption of existing high coupon debt, Prudential is considering raising new equity of around $2.5-3 billion. Such a transaction, if executed, would maintain and enhance the Group's financial flexibility in light of the breadth of the opportunities to invest in growth and aim to increase the Group's investor base in Asia. Prudential believes that there are clear benefits to the Group, as an Asian focused company, of increasing its institutional ownership in Asia and enhancing the liquidity of its ordinary shares in Hong Kong. As a result, its preference is to raise new equity through a fully marketed global offering to institutional investors concurrent with a public offering in Hong Kong to retail investors, to be undertaken after the Jackson demerger, subject to market conditions. The Group has held discussions with shareholders and the allocation of any offering will take into account a number of criteria including the/uni00A0interests of existing shareholders and the strategic benefits of enhancing its shareholder base and liquidity in Hong Kong. The Group believes that there is potential for substantial value creation for all shareholders through the transformation of Prudential into a business purely focused on profitable growth in Asia and Africa.\n\nPrudential is planning to retain a 19.9 per cent non-controlling interest in Jackson 1 at the point of demerger, which will be reported within our IFRS balance sheet as a financial investment at fair value. Subject to market conditions, we intend to monetise a portion of this investment to support investment in Asia within 12 months of the planned demerger, such that the Group would own less than 10 per cent at/uni00A0the/uni00A0end of such period.\n\nAt the point of proposed separation and subject to market conditions, Jackson expects to have an RBC ratio 2 in excess of 450 per cent and Total Financial Leverage 3 in the range of 25 to 30 per cent. Jackson expects to achieve this level of RBC at the point of separation by contributing proceeds of debt and any hybrid capital raising to its regulated insurance subsidiaries. As a result, we do not expect that Prudential will receive a pre-separation dividend from Jackson.\n\nFollowing the planned demerger, Jackson intends to pursue a focused strategy that prioritises optimisation and stability of capital resources while protecting franchise value. Jackson's financial goals as a standalone company will be designed to maintain a resilient balance sheet in order to provide shareholders with stable capital returns and profitable growth over the long term.",

        "page_content": "In Asia, our focus is on strengthening our footprint in our key strategic markets, building our distribution and product range, and accelerating the digitalisation of our platform. Our businesses in Asia are aligned with supportive structural trends in the region, in particular rising prosperity and ageing populations, which are leading to significant and/uni00A0growing protection and savings gaps.\n\nWe have built top-three positions in nine Asian life insurance markets, and we have significant upside potential in the region's two largest markets, China and India. In Mainland China, our branch network with/uni00A0our local partner CITIC now covers 77 per cent of the country's 1.4 billion people 4 , and we see a broad range of opportunities to participate more deeply in that market. In India the businesses continue to develop, with our life business recording a 17 per cent rise in health and protection APE sales and our asset management business increasing funds under management 5 by 6 per cent to $26.9 billion 20 . At 31 December 2020, our investment in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was valued at $2.2 billion, in excess of the amount at which it/uni00A0is recorded in our IFRS and EEV financial statements.\n\nAcross our Asian markets, our comprehensive distribution network allows consumers to access our services how, where and when they choose. Our network of around 600,000 agents 6 is growing ever more skilled and productive. Agent recruits 7 in Asia (excluding India) rose 4 per cent in the year, and the number of agents qualifying for elite MDRT status doubled to more than 13,200. Our agent management has moved online across all markets, enhancing the effectiveness of agent communication and operation, and expanding sales capacity, with the number of cases per active agent 7 increasing by 8 per cent in/uni00A02020 from the prior year.\n\nWe have access to around 20,000 bank branches and are working closely with/uni00A0our partner banks to develop their online offerings. In/uni00A02020, we entered into a major strategic partnership with TMB Bank in Thailand and also began new relationships with banks in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Ghana. We are also developing new distribution channels through our digital partnerships, including OVO, Indonesia's leading mobile payments platform, and The1, Thailand's largest loyalty/uni00A0platform.\n\nThe services we offer are equally broad. We meet the needs of everyone from affluent families looking for sophisticated financial advice to people considering saving and financial protection for the first time. Across Asia we have seen a heightened need for the health and protection products that we provide, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a survey, 58 per cent of consumers in our Asian markets stated that they were interested in products with value-added services, with 46 per cent of customers searching for new insurance products 8 . This has been converted into an increase in the proportions of APE sales represented by health and protection products in seven of/uni00A0our Asian markets.\n\nWe have East Asia's number-one Islamic life insurance business, which/uni00A0saw a 49 per cent growth in new policies in 2020, contributing to/uni00A0a 14 per cent growth in APE sales for these products in Malaysia and/uni00A0Indonesia combined. Malaysia Takaful is the leader in its market, with a 32 per cent share of the market in 2020, as is our sharia business in Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population of any country 9 , with a 35 per cent share of the sharia-compliant market. Our Business at Pulse (formerly PruWorks) proposition, which serves small and medium-sized enterprises, continues to develop, driving APE sales from group business up 17 per cent in 2020.\n\nOur Asia asset manager, Eastspring, manages $247.8 billion in assets across 11 markets in Asia, and is a top-10 asset manager in seven of those markets. Eastspring has a broad product set and an unrivalled ability to serve the needs both of Asian savers and global investors seeking access to Asian opportunities, and we continue to diversify the/uni00A0product set.\n\nOur investment in Africa gives us exposure to a growing, under-served continent whose population is expected to double to more than two billion people by 2050.\n\nThe pace of our innovation continues to accelerate, and that is translating into improved operational performance. In 2020, we launched or revamped 175 products 10 across our markets, contributing 20 per cent of APE sales. Of these, more than 115 were traditional and/uni00A0health and protection products, including Anxin, our digital health/uni00A0and protection solution for the China market, with 165,000 policies sold in 2020, around 50 per cent of them to new customers. In/uni00A0Indonesia several new launches of simplified standalone protection products saw their contribution rise to 37 per cent of APE, up from 8 per cent in 2019, which drove an overall increase in total new cases sold in 2020 of/uni00A012 per cent.\n\nWe have significant investment appetite in Asia and Africa that is based on the absolute size and demographic characteristics of each economy and our ability to build competitive advantage, leveraging our scale and expertise. While we will continue to build on our leading positions in Hong Kong and ASEAN, we see the greatest opportunities in the largest economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. We expect this strategy to deliver profitable and sustainable compounding growth and high risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. Accordingly, our dividend policy announced in August reflects a rebalancing of capital allocation from cash dividends to reinvestment of capital into the Asia business.\n\nFollowing the proposed separation of Jackson, our focus on Asia and Africa will support long-term delivery of future shareholder returns through value appreciation, with a focus on achieving sustained double-digit growth in embedded value per share. This will in turn be/uni00A0supported by the growth rates of new business profit, which are expected to substantially exceed GDP growth rates in the markets in/uni00A0which the post-demerger Prudential Group operates.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Pulse: building our digital capabilities\n\nOur culture of innovation is exemplified by Pulse, our new digital platform, which is enhancing our digital capability across Asia and/uni00A0Africa.\n\nThe first iteration of the Pulse mobile app was launched in Malaysia in August 2019, with features focused on helping our customers - and the wider population - prevent and postpone ill-health. These initial services included an artificial intelligence-driven medical symptom checker, telemedicine and dengue fever alerts. Since then, Pulse has/uni00A0been launched in 11 languages across 11 Asian and four African markets. 58 per cent of Asian consumers desire access to healthcare value-added services 8 , such as virtual GP, and new features have continued to be added to Pulse on a weekly basis to meet this demand. Covid-19 has stimulated interest in the health features of Pulse, as both consumers and policymakers embrace the flexibility and accessibility offered by digital health solutions in a period when travel and face-to-face contact has been restricted. By February 2021, Pulse had been downloaded around 20 million times 11 . Sales referrals from Pulse to our agents in 2020, together with a small amount of revenue from bite-sized products sold directly on Pulse, translated into $211 million of APE sales 12 .\n\nIn 2021, as we continue to help customers become healthier, we intend to broaden our services to give greater support to people's wealth needs.\n\n## A C\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOur financial performance during 2020 provides tangible evidence of/uni00A0how we are successfully executing our strategy.\n\nAt a Group level, overall adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns 13 (adjusted operating profit) for 2020 from our continuing operations was $5,507 million, 4 per cent higher than the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis, reflecting the continued growth of our Asia businesses, offset by lower US profits. Central expenses declined by 8 per cent, reflecting lower interest and head office costs. IFRS profit after tax from continuing operations 13 was $2,185 million in 2020 (2019: $1,953 million on an actual exchange rate basis).\n\nIn Asia, in a challenging environment, our diversified, high-quality, recurring-premium business model enabled us to continue to grow value and scale, with our total Asia embedded value reaching $44.2 billion, an increase of 13 per cent compared with 2019, and more than doubling over the last five years. Adjusted operating profit was 13 per cent higher than 2019 on a constant exchange rate basis, driven by the resilience of our in-force life business and the rebound of the level of funds managed by our asset manager Eastspring in the second half of 2020.\n\nThe quality of our historic book of insurance business contributed to/uni00A0resilient in-force growth, with a 6 per cent increase in renewal premiums 14 to $20.1 billion. The high level of renewal premiums is/uni00A0the/uni00A0result of the high level of regular-premium business we sell (representing 90 per cent of APE sales in 2020), the high mix of health and protection business, which formed 65 per cent of new business profit in the year, and a 90 per cent customer retention rate 15 . This contributed to life insurance adjusted operating profit in Asia growing by 14 per cent (on a constant exchange rate basis). The performance was broad-based, led by Hong Kong, up 20 per cent, with a further eight markets delivering double-digit growth.\n\nOur Asia asset management business, Eastspring, saw total assets under management reach $247.8 billion, up 3 per cent from the end of 2019 and 13 per cent higher than 30 June 2020, on an actual exchange rate basis, with external net outflows moderating in the second half of/uni00A0year alongside improving equity markets. Eastspring's funds under management also benefited from net inflows from internal Asia life funds of $8.5 billion during 2020, representing a continuing source of reliable funds flows to the Eastspring business and a structural strength of our business model. Overall, this helped the adjusted operating profit increase by 2 per cent compared with the prior year. Continued cost discipline helped maintain the cost/income ratio 14 at 52 per cent.\n\nDespite the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across our markets, we delivered a relatively resilient performance in respect of new business profit and APE sales. Outside Hong Kong, new business profit 17 was (4) per cent lower, in line with a (6) per cent reduction in/uni00A0APE sales 18 . In Hong Kong, new business profit was down (62) per cent, with APE sales (63) per cent lower, largely as a result of/uni00A0the impact of Covid-19-related restrictions on cross-border sales. Overall, this led to a (28) per cent fall in Asia APE sales as compared with 2019. China, our third-largest market by APE sales, was a particular highlight, with bancassurance APE sales up by 34 per cent compared with 2019. Agency APE sales rebounded by 15 per cent in/uni00A0the second quarter as restrictions were lifted, and overall APE sales in the second half increased by 4 per cent compared with the same period in the prior year. New business profit in China increased 3 per cent to $269 million and new business profit margins strengthened. This was led by the agency force focus on protection products, which accounted for 53 per cent of sales from this channel and as a result agency channel margins 16 climbed to 85 per cent (2019:/uni00A074 per cent).\n\nThe nature and timing of Covid-19-related disruption varied considerably across our markets. The ability of our franchise to grow as/uni00A0restrictions were lifted is evident from the sequential increase in APE sales in nine markets including Hong Kong, with the third-quarter total Asia APE sales above the second by 33 per cent, and the fourth quarter above the third by 18 per cent.\n\nWe continue to build our operations in Africa, with APE sales reaching $112 million, representing growth of 51 per cent. Our African businesses are progressing well with the adoption of our new digital sales management system, which has driven positive operating trends.\n\nJackson maintained its leading position in the US variable annuity market 19 , with new variable annuity APE sales up 13 per cent to $1,662 million, reflecting customer demand for Jackson's products in/uni00A0this market and the breadth and expertise of its distribution force.\n\nJackson's adjusted operating profit was $2,796 million (2019: $3,070 million), reflecting DAC adjustment effects and the expected reduction in spread-related earnings following the reinsurance contract with Athene in June 2020 and lower asset yields, partially offset by higher fee income from increased average account balances. Overall Jackson incurred a $(247) million post-tax loss (2019: loss of/uni00A0$(380) million), where the economic nature of our hedging programme, and the related accounting mismatches, alongside the/uni00A0exceptional equity volatility seen over the year, resulted in the recognition of losses on equity derivatives taken out as part of Jackson's hedging programme.",

We will continue to apply these strengths as we move forward. With each cycle of lockdown and reopening, we have adopted varied responses depending on the local conditions, we have improved our agility as we have responded, and the strength of our business has remained apparent. We expect that vaccination programmes will be launched in a number of our markets in 2021, triggering a gradual return to more normal economic patterns. However, the pace of these programmes and their effect is likely to vary substantially and gives a degree of uncertainty over performance of the business in the short term.\n\nOur most significant market by new business profit and embedded value is Hong Kong. Sales to Mainland Chinese individuals in Hong/uni00A0Kong have been severely curtailed by the closure of the border with mainland China. There is at present unlikely to be a lifting of the/uni00A0border restrictions until the third quarter of 2021 at the earliest, but/uni00A0this/uni00A0depends on a number of factors. However, we believe there will continue to be demand from Mainland Chinese customers for the/uni00A0Hong Kong product suite once the border reopening occurs and/uni00A0we/uni00A0have been building on our existing product and digitalisation capabilities to continue to serve both these and domestic customers in/uni00A0the future. Since the second quarter of 2020 we have seen sequential quarterly increases in sales in Asia, but our continued success across all our markets will be dependent in part on government reaction to changes in the number and type of Covid-19 cases and the vaccine roll-out.\n\nNevertheless, we are confident that the demand for our products will/uni00A0continue to grow in line with the structural growth in our chosen markets, and that our expanding and increasingly digitalised distribution platforms will meet that demand.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Prudential is planning to retain a 19.9 per cent voting interest and a 19.7 per cent economic interest.\n- 2 Representing the RBC ratio of Jackson National Life that reflects the capital and capital requirements of Jackson National Life and its subsidiaries, including Jackson National Life NY.\n- 3 Calculated on a US GAAP basis as the ratio of total/uni00A0debt/uni00A0(including senior debt, hybrid debt and preferred/uni00A0securities) to total debt and shareholders' equity (excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive/uni00A0Income).\n- 4 2019 data for population.

We focus on the following metrics when looking at our financial performance 1 .\n\n## Adjusted IFRS operating profit based on/uni00A0longer-term investment returns (adjusted operating profit) 2 $m\n\nThe Group's business involves entering into long-term contracts with customers, and hence the Group manages its associated assets and liabilities over a longer-term time horizon. This enables the Group to manage a degree of short-term market volatility. Therefore, adjusted operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is management's preferred measure when evaluating the performance of the business. Other/uni00A0distorting items are excluded from adjusted operating profit to allow more relevant period-on-period comparisons of the trading operations of the Group, eg the effects of corporate transactions are excluded.\n\n## EEV new business profit 3 $m\n\nLife insurance products are, by their nature, long term and generate profit over a number of years. Embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profit streams of the Group. EEV new business profit reflects the value of future profit streams which are not fully captured in the year of sale under IFRS reporting.\n\n## EEV operating profit 6 $m\n\nEEV operating profit is provided as an additional measure of profitability. This measure includes EEV new business profit, the change in the value of the Group's long-term in-force business, and profit from our asset management and other businesses on an IFRS basis. As with IFRS, EEV operating profit reflects the underlying results based on longerterm investment returns.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit in 2020 is 4 per cent higher on a constant and actual exchange rate basis compared with 2019.\n\nAdjusted operating profit for the Group excluding Jackson Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries (Jackson) was $2,757 million up 24 per cent on a constant exchange rate basis (23 per cent on an actual exchange rate basis), reflecting higher adjusted operating profit from Asia life and asset management operations, up 13 per cent on a constant exchange rate basis to $3,667 million (12 per cent on an actual exchange rate basis) and lower central and restructuring costs (excluding Jackson), down 12 per cent to $(910) million (2019: $(1,029) million) on an actual exchange rate basis.\n\nJackson adjusted operating profit before restructuring costs was $2,796 million, down (9) per cent largely reflecting the impact of DAC adjustments in the current year and the expected reduction in spread-related earnings following the Athene reinsurance agreement. Jackson adjusted operating profit after restructuring costs was $2,750 million.\n\nEEV new business profit in 2020 decreased by (37) per cent on a constant exchange rate basis and (36) per cent actual exchange rate basis compared with 2019.\n\nEEV new business profit for Asia declined by (38) per cent on a constant and actual exchange rate basis to $2,201 million, driven by declines in new business sales as a result of Covid-19 related disruption.\n\nJackson EEV new business profit declined by (32) per cent, largely reflecting a decline in sales and the reduction in interest rates during 2020, partly mitigated by the higher proportion of variable annuity sales in the year.\n\nGroup EEV operating profit in 2020 decreased by/uni00A0(24) per cent on an actual exchange rate basis compared with 2019.\n\nEEV operating profit for the Group excluding Jackson fell by (34) per cent on an actual exchange rate basis, largely reflecting the decline in new business profit, described above and the effect of lower interest rates on the in-force operating profits.\n\nJackson EEV operating profit increased 4 per cent to/uni00A0$1,844 million.\n\n5,310\n\n3,063\n\n2,247\n\n2019\n\n$m\n\n2020\n\n$m\n\nJackson\n\nJackson\n\nGroup excl.

For/uni00A0insurance operations, it represents amounts maturing from the in-force business during the period, less investment in new business and excludes other non-operating items. For asset management, it equates to post-tax operating profit for the year.\n\nGroup operating free surplus generation from continuing insurance and asset management operations before restructuring costs was $3,004 million in the year (2019: $2,897 million on/uni00A0an actual exchange rate basis). Group operating free surplus generation from continuing insurance and asset management operations after restructuring costs was $2,886 million in the year/uni00A0(2019: $2,861 million on an actual exchange rate basis).\n\n## EEV basis shareholders' equity 6 $bn\n\nEEV represents the present value of the shareholders' interest in the post-tax future profits (on a local statutory basis) expected to arise from/uni00A0the current book of long-term business, after/uni00A0sufficient allowance has been made for the aggregate risks in the business. Asset management and other non-insurance subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in EEV at the/uni00A0Group's proportionate share of IFRS basis shareholders' equity, with central Group debt shown on a market value basis.\n\n## Group local capital summation method shareholder basis surplus 5 $bn\n\nThe Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA) is the Group-wide supervisor for the Prudential Group. In/uni00A0agreement with the Hong Kong IA, the Group currently applies the local capital summation method (LCSM) to determine Group regulatory capital requirements (both minimum and prescribed levels) until the Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework is effective, which/uni00A0for Prudential is expected in the second quarter of 2021 upon designation by the Hong Kong IA. See the Group capital position section of/uni00A0the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report for further information.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 The comparative results shown above have been prepared using an actual exchange rate (AER) basis except where otherwise stated. Comparative results on a constant exchange rate (CER) basis are also shown in financial tables in the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report on our 2020 financial performance. Growth rates for 2019 to 2020 are on an AER basis.\n- 2 Adjusted operating profit is management's primary measure of profitability and provides an underlying operating result based on longer-term investment returns and excludes non-operating items. This/uni00A0alternative performance measure is reconciled to/uni00A0IFRS profit for the year in note B1.1 of the IFRS financial statements.\n\nOperating free surplus generation before restructuring costs for Asia operations increased 8 per cent on a constant exchange rate basis (7 per cent on an actual exchange rate basis) to $1,895 million, following the growth of the in-force portfolio and lower levels of new business, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rates compared with the prior year.\n\nJackson operating free surplus generated before restructuring costs fell (1) per cent compared with/uni00A02019, which included a $355 million benefit following the integration of the John Hancock business acquired in 2018.\n\nGroup total EEV basis shareholders' equity decreased (1) per cent during 2020 to $54.0 billion.\n\nEEV shareholders' equity for the Group excluding Jackson increased 9 per cent to $41.9 billion, largely reflecting Asia new business sales and operating returns on its growing in-force book.\n\nThe Group's available capital, as recorded on a/uni00A0LCSM shareholder basis, covers the Group's minimum capital/uni00A0requirement over three times. In/uni00A02020, capital generation from the in-force business has/uni00A0been used to invest in new business, pay the external dividend and invest in new partnerships. After these investment and distributions, and the/uni00A0impact of market movements, LCSM shareholder surplus increased from $9.5 billion, with an LCSM shareholder ratio of/uni00A0309 per cent, at 31 December 2019 to $11.0 billion, with an LCSM ratio of 328 per cent, at/uni00A031 December 2020.\n\n- 3 New business profit, on a post-tax basis, on business sold in the year, calculated in accordance with EEV/uni00A0principles.\n- 4 Operating free surplus generated from insurance and/uni00A0asset management operations. For insurance operations, operating free surplus generated represents amounts maturing from the in-force business during the year less investment in new business and excludes non-operating items. For/uni00A0asset/uni00A0management businesses, it equates to post-tax operating profit for the year. Restructuring costs are presented separately from the business unit amount.

We make healthcare affordable and accessible and promote financial inclusion across our markets. We protect people's wealth and help them grow their assets, and we empower our customers to save for their goals. This purpose is served through implementing our business strategy, set out in this section and our environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy set out in our ESG report on page 70.\n\nWith this purpose in mind, our intention is to take full advantage of the/uni00A0long-term structural opportunities in Asia and Africa and to pursue a path for a fully independent Jackson. In January 2021, the Board announced that it had decided to pursue the separation of Jackson from the Group in the first half of 2021 through a demerger, whereby shares in Jackson would be distributed to Prudential shareholders. The/uni00A0result of this separation will be two separately listed companies with distinct investment propositions, which the Group's Board believes will lead to improved strategic outcomes for both businesses.\n\nThe Prudential Group will focus exclusively on its high-growth Asia and Africa businesses. We will also accelerate our development of digitally enabled products and services to help prevent, postpone and/uni00A0protect our customers from threats to their health and wellbeing, as well as supporting them to achieve their savings goals.\n\nJackson will continue to help Americans grow and protect their retirement savings and income to enable them to pursue financial freedom for life through its differentiated products, well-known brand/uni00A0and industry-leading distribution network.\n\nFurther information on the Prudential Group's and Jackson's respective/uni00A0businesses are set out below. The result of the proposed separation of/uni00A0Jackson will be two separately listed companies with distinct investment propositions, which the Group's Board believes will/uni00A0lead to/uni00A0improved strategic outcomes for both businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Asia and Africa\n\nWe have a pan-Asian footprint, with our largest life and protection operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia as well as/uni00A0our joint venture in China. We also operate in Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and have a/uni00A0successful partnership in India. Within this footprint, Prudential has/uni00A0top three positions 1 in 9 out of 13 life markets and extensive distribution networks, across digital, agency and bancassurance channels. We focus on delivering profitable regular premium health and protection insurance products and fee-based earnings.\n\nIn asset management, Eastspring manages $247.8 billion across 11/uni00A0markets in Asia and provides focused investment solutions to third-party retail and institutional clients as well as to our internally sourced life funds. Eastspring is a top 10 asset manager in 7 of the 11/uni00A0markets in which it operates, and is the largest pan-Asian retail asset/uni00A0manager excluding Japan 2 .\n\nSince 2014 we have also built a rapidly growing multi-product, multi-distribution business in Africa, with operations now in eight countries across the continent, and have over one million customers. Starting in 2021 the regional office for Africa will be based in Nairobi, making East Africa our hub for the continued success of operating on/uni00A0the continent.\n\nOur offering in Asia and Africa is evolving to respond to growing customer awareness and demand for products that address health and wellness, as well as providing life insurance cover. Pulse by Prudential, our health and wellness platform provides a compelling offering to address these needs, building on our existing distribution channels and trusted brand. Further information on Pulse by Prudential, and our markets, customers, products and distribution within the region is set out below.\n\nAsia has grown significantly over the last 10 years, for example over the decade from 2010 to 2020, embedded value in Asia grew on average by 14 per cent 3 per annum and at 31 December 2020 was $44.2 billion. Since 2013, Prudential has committed almost $10 billion of capital to support growth in Asia, including around $5 billion of inorganic investments to grow our distribution reach and to build digital capability. Around one-third of the total investment has been made since January 2019. Investments in 2020 included establishing a/uni00A015-year strategic bancassurance partnership with TMB, which significantly strengthens our distribution capability in Thailand's fast-growing life insurance sector and strongly complements our top-five position 2 in the country's mutual fund market. In other markets/uni00A0we have also established a new bancassurance partnership with SeABank, a fast-growing bank in Vietnam with approximately 1.2 million customers and almost 170 branches, as well as signing new/uni00A0agreements with Banque Franco-Lao (BFL) BRED Group in Laos, and in early 2021 with Phnom Penh Commercial Bank Plc (PPCBank) in/uni00A0Cambodia.\n\nWe have significant investment appetite in Asia in the future that is based on the absolute size and demographic characteristics of each economy and our ability to build competitive advantage leveraging our/uni00A0scale and expertise. While we will continue to build on our leading/uni00A0positions in Hong Kong and members of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN), we see the greatest opportunities in/uni00A0the largest economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. This/uni00A0investment is expected to deliver profitable and sustainable compounding growth and will support long-term delivery of future shareholder returns through value appreciation, with a focus on achieving sustained double-digit growth in embedded value per share.\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Markets\n\nThe life insurance industry in Asia and Africa remains in the early stages of development, as characterised by the low penetration rates across the region for insurance. In particular, most of our Asia markets are approaching the level of per capita annual income when demand increases sharply. Around 50 per cent of the global population lacks access to essential health services 13 , and across the Asia region specifically, there are significant health funding and wellness gaps; 80 per cent of Asians do not have insurance cover 14 and spend some $400 billion on healthcare as an out-of-pocket expense 15 . Similarly, in/uni00A0Africa, while mobile phone access has increased tremendously over/uni00A0the last 20 years, less than 50 per cent of Africans have access to/uni00A0modern health facilities 16 , and 80 per cent have to rely on public health facilities, which are often understocked, understaffed, and/uni00A0difficult to reach due to the physical and financial burdens of/uni00A0transportation 17 .\n\nOur largest market in respect of APE sales is Hong Kong, which accounted for 21 per cent of our overall Asia APE sales in 2020, followed by Singapore, contributing 17 per cent and China which accounted for 16 per cent. The rest of our new business is diversified across 10 markets. Our adjusted operating profit is well balanced, with the largest contributions from Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia.\n\nAdjusted operating profit by market % vs 2019 CER\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                        | Adjusted operating profit   | Share  of total  Asia   | Growth (CER)   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| Hong Kong              | $891m                       | 24%                     | 20%            |\n| Singapore              | $574m                       | 16%                     | 18%            |\n| Indonesia              | $519m                       | 14%                     | (1)%           |\n| Malaysia               | $309m                       | 8%                      | 14%            |\n| Eastspring Investments | $283m                       | 8%                      | 2%             |\n| Vietnam                | $270m                       | 7%                      | 14%            |\n| China JV               | $251m                       | 7%                      | 15%            |\n| Thailand               | $210m                       | 6%                      | 24%            |\n| Philippines            | $95m                        | 3%                      | 25%            |\n| Taiwan                 | $85m                        | 2%                      | 10%            |\n| Other                  | $180m                       | 5%                      | 3%             |\n\nWith regards to strategy, we see the most significant opportunities for/uni00A0growth potential in life insurance and asset management in the four/uni00A0largest economies in our footprint, namely China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. Our joint venture operations in China and India together with our businesses in Indonesia and Thailand, provide us with scaled access, where we can build leadership positions with competitive advantage and economies of scale. We also intend to continue building on our leading positions within Hong Kong and ASEAN.\n\nIn China, our China life business is a 50/50 joint venture with CITIC, a/uni00A0leading Chinese state-owned conglomerate. Our China JV business performed well in 2020 after the Covid-19 disruption in the first quarter, increasing new business profit by 3 per cent. Building on/uni00A0our/uni00A0existing nationwide coverage of 20 branches and 99 cities (an/uni00A0increase of five since 2019), we expect our China JV business will continue to grow at pace by expanding and deepening our presence from our current geographical footprint, and by leveraging our multi-distribution platform. We operate our asset management business in China through CITIC-Prudential Fund Management Company Limited, a JV with CITIC with assets under management of/uni00A0$9.6 billion 19 , as well as our wholly-owned private/uni00A0fund manager operationalised in 2019 within Eastspring, which now has sourced and sub-advised assets under management of $743 million. Our Chinese life insurance joint venture has also established its own asset management company in 2020, Prudential-CITIC Asset Management Co, which further strengthens our capabilities in savings and retirement products.\n\nIn India, our business consists of our 22.1 per cent holding of the Indian/uni00A0Stock Exchange listed life insurance business, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance (with our investment valued at $2.2 billion as at 31 December 2020) and 49 per cent of the asset manager, ICICI Prudential Asset Management, which has total funds under management 7 of $26.9 billion 19 . Our India life business continues to pivot to health and protection, with a 17 per cent increase in health and/uni00A0protection APE sales, which now represent 24 per cent of total APE sales (up 9 percentage points on 2019). We will continue to capture the significant potential in the Indian life market, with an aspiration to/uni00A0double 2019 new business profit in three to four years, by/uni00A0continuing to grow the business, improving retention and enhancing productivity.\n\nIn Indonesia, we continue to strengthen our market leadership, including in the sharia market where we increased APE sales by 6 per cent and new business profit by 27 per cent in 2020, and propel growth by broadening our product offerings, as well as digitalising our business model. We added 60 products during 2020, doubled MDRT qualifiers to over 2,100, and launched digital products through both Pulse and our OVO partnership. We have seen positive momentum in the last quarter of 2020, being the highest sales quarter of 2020, and believe our business transformation will continue to drive growth in the future.\n\nIn Thailand our new distribution partnership with TMB will help us achieve top-three leadership in the bancassurance channel, and we will further accelerate growth by developing a holistic omni-channel business model. Coupled with the completion of the acquisition of TMBAM and TFund which gives us a top-five ranking in the mutual fund market, this will give us a high-quality platform to deliver best-in-class health and wealth solutions to serve the growing retirement and investment needs of both the rising middle class and/uni00A0the growing high net worth segments.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "In our other large businesses, we also see ample opportunities to/uni00A0continue to grow at pace. In Hong Kong, we believe based on our own and third party surveys there is latent demand from Mainland Chinese customers for our Hong Kong product suite and that the eventual normalisation of visitor arrivals as the border reopening occurs will allow for the return of this important source of new business. For example, 61 per cent of Mainland Chinese visitor preference 20 is to receive critical illness medical treatment in Hong/uni00A0Kong. In the meantime, we continue to build our already strong and/uni00A0substantial Hong Kong domestic business through multi-channel expansion and increased digitalisation of our service offering. We also continue to/uni00A0broaden our/uni00A0product offerings, such as our mid-tier medical reimbursement product, the PRUHealth VHIS VIP Plan, to/uni00A0fulfil the protection needs of/uni00A0our customers. We will also broaden access to Mainland China consumers through Greater Bay Area initiatives and remain a destination of choice through our marketleading products and service/uni00A0propositions.\n\nIn Singapore, we see significant opportunities in expanding the servicing of the high net worth and small and medium enterprise (SME) markets, alongside supporting a fast ageing population to address under-covered retirement and health needs. In Malaysia, we/uni00A0have leading market positions in both the conventional and Takaful/uni00A0markets. In particular, in the underprovided Takaful segment where we see substantial opportunity for growth, we increased our APE sales by 26 per cent and our new business profit by 29 per cent in/uni00A02020.\n\nIn our other high-potential growth markets of Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, we see the opportunity for rapid growth through the roll-out of our efficient and scalable business model, multi-channel distribution networks and the provision of market-leading digital products and services through Pulse. These markets currently have very low levels/uni00A0of life insurance penetration, for/uni00A0example with life insurance penetration 5 of just 1.4 per cent in Vietnam and 1.2 per cent in the Philippines. However, with rising GDP/uni00A0per capita at or reaching a threshold of $10,000 to $20,000, and/uni00A0supported by our proven and market-leading positions, we are confident of delivering new life insurance sales growth well in excess of GDP growth in these markets.\n\nWe see substantial opportunities to accelerate our asset management business, Eastspring, building on its leading market position as Asia's/uni00A0largest retail asset manager (excluding Japan) 2 and structural advantages of reliable and predictable inflows from our life businesses. The completion of the TMBAM and TFund acquisitions in Thailand and successful development of its China business, mentioned above, have strengthened its strategic portfolio.\n\nSince 2014 we have also built a rapidly growing multi-product business in Africa, with operations now in eight countries across the continent. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, APE sales at Prudential Africa have grown by 51 per cent 21 to $112 million during 2020, with the number of/uni00A0active agents significantly ahead of the same period last year. In/uni00A0Ghana, we have renewed our exclusive agreement with Fidelity Bank for an additional 10 years, building on a successful partnership over the past five years. We also announced a new partnership with Vodafone Ghana to provide an innovative microinsurance product to/uni00A0their nine million plus subscribers. Meanwhile, our team in Nigeria has/uni00A0launched a new partnership with the largest mobile operator in/uni00A0the/uni00A0country, MTN, in an effort to reach its subscriber base of over/uni00A070 million people and provide protection to the millions of/uni00A0uninsured/uni00A0Nigerians.\n\n## Products and brands\n\nWe offer a wide range of insurance products that are tailored to local market requirements and fast-changing individual needs. We focus on/uni00A0health and protection and savings products with 65 per cent of new business profit contributed by health and protection solutions and the rest by savings products that include participating, linked and other traditional products.\n\nThe diversity and resilience of our business is supported by the continued innovations and enhancements we make to our product range, which include broadening coverage for new risks and adding innovative features. In 2020, we introduced or revamped 175 new products 22 contributing 20 per cent of APE sales, including simplified lower case-sized protection offerings.\n\n## New business profit by product, 2020 $m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced customer interest in health and protection products, with 58 per cent of consumers across our Asian markets desiring access to healthcare value-added services, such as access to a virtual GP 23 . This has been converted into an increase in the proportions of APE represented by health and protection products in/uni00A0seven/uni00A0of our Asian markets, led by India (up 9 percentage points to 24 per cent of APE sales), Singapore (up 5 percentage points/uni00A0to/uni00A025 per cent of APE sales), Thailand (up 9 percentage points to/uni00A025 per cent of APE sales) and Vietnam (up 3 percentage points to 17 per cent of APE sales), in turn resulting in increased margins for our/uni00A0Asia/uni00A0markets excluding Hong Kong. Of the 175 new or revamped products noted above, more than 115 were traditional and health and/uni00A0protection products.\n\nOur Hong Kong business offers domestic Hong Kong residents and mainland visitors sophisticated critical illness, medical benefits and life/uni00A0insurance protection business. 91 per cent of all Hong Kong consumers 23 indicated they would retain life insurance even if their financial position is disadvantaged by Covid-19 re-enforcing the resilience of this market. The investment proposition provides access to international equities and bonds. In particular, our main with-profits product offering uses a with-profits structure, which pools the investments of/uni00A0policyholders and allocates returns based on long-term investment performance (similar to that historically used in the UK), and leads to/uni00A0attractive margins. The business has a high level of renewals that is/uni00A0substantially higher than the premiums from new business. Singapore offers a similar type of product mix and also uses a/uni00A0UK-style with-profits structure.",

        "page_content": "In China, Anxin, our digital health and protection solution generated 165,000 policies in 2020, with around 50 per cent to new customers. In/uni00A0Hong Kong, we launched in the second half of 2020 PRUHealth VHIS VIP Plan, a tax-efficient medical insurance targeting the mid-tier segment, which has contributed 10 per cent of new business profit for/uni00A0the domestic segment in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIn Indonesia, we retain leadership in the sharia-compliant market, with/uni00A035 per cent share, accounting for 37 per cent of agency sales in Indonesia. Our PRUCinta product, the first traditional sharia product with specific cash value, accounts for 14 per cent of Indonesia agency sales. More widely, we have launched 60 products in Indonesia in 2020, including lower ticket standalone protection products which collectively accounted for 37 per cent of the APE mix (2019: 8 per cent) and 52 per cent of new case count mix (2019: 11 per cent).\n\nAlongside offering products that meet customer needs, we invest in/uni00A0our brands to build trust, drive awareness and attract and retain/uni00A0customers.\n\n## Distribution and customer engagement\n\nWe believe in a multi-channel and integrated distribution strategy for our business which can adapt and respond flexibly depending on local market conditions. Our distribution network is one of the strongest and most diversified in the Asia region, across agency, bancassurance and non-traditional partnerships, including digital. In recent years, we/uni00A0have also established non-traditional partnerships to broaden our customer reach, particularly the digitally-savvy millennial segment. In/uni00A0total, we have more than 300 life insurance and asset management distribution partnerships in Asia. Alongside these distribution channels we also have Pulse by Prudential (discussed further below).\n\n## New business profit by channel, 2020 $m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agency\n\nWe have around 600,000 licensed tied agents 24 across our life insurance markets, and the productivity of active agents increased 8 per cent 25,26 in the year, based on number of cases, which are becoming/uni00A0smaller in size as we, and our customers, focus increasingly on standalone protection products. Our agency channel is a core/uni00A0component of our success, comprising 74 per cent of our new business profit given the high proportion of high margin protection products sold.\n\nOur continued support for the agency channel positions us well for sustainable growth. Our agent management has moved online across all markets, enhancing effectiveness of agent communication and operation, and expanding sales capacity with agent recruits 26 of 143,000 in the year. We deployed virtual sales tools across all markets for almost all products, and 28 per cent of agency new cases since April 2020, together with 27 per cent of bancassurance new cases/uni00A0since July 2020 have been made virtually.\n\nDespite the gradual relaxation of Covid-19 containment measures in/uni00A0several markets, virtual selling tools have now become mainstream with distributors, and virtual sales in the fourth quarter represented 23 per cent of both agency and bancassurance sales.\n\nWe place great emphasis on agent professionalism and promote career/uni00A0progression by providing tailored training programmes that/uni00A0share experience and best practice across different markets. In/uni00A0addition, to/uni00A0further assist our agents during the sales process and/uni00A0enhance productivity we continually upgrade the tools at their disposal. During 2020, the number of agents qualifying for the Million/uni00A0Dollar Round Table (MDRT) doubled in the year to more than/uni00A013,200.\n\nIn Africa the number of active agents in 2020 significantly increased from the prior year. The increase in active agents is a direct result of implementing our Rookie Development Programme in each market, which helps with agent professionalism and customer focus, as well as transitioning new agents from the classroom to the field, and making those agents active within the first month of their recruitment. In most markets, as a response to Covid-19-related restrictions, we rapidly innovated to create an end-to-end virtual sales submission process, with a virtual recruitment and onboarding process for distributors as well as delivering training digitally. Moreover, 2020 marked the first time each market has had at least one agent qualify for the MDRT increasing the number of qualifiers to 38 from 15 in the prior year.\n\n## Bancassurance\n\nWe also have a leading bancassurance franchise that provides access to around 20,000 bank outlets through our strategic partnerships with multi-national banks and prominent domestic banks.\n\nOur bancassurance partnerships made an important contribution to/uni00A0our business last year. Our new partnership with TMB in Thailand, which commenced on 1 January 2021, will give us access to an expanded network of 685 branches. In preparation we have trained more than 5,500 bank sellers and nearly doubled the number of sales support staff/uni00A0to 240. We have launched a refreshed set of propositions encompassing the high net worth, retail, commercial and SME segments and rolled out a new e-POS system.\n\nOutside of Hong Kong, our bancassurance channel APE sales remained stable despite Covid-19 related disruption. We were particularly pleased to see the positive momentum in our bancassurance channel in Indonesia, which saw APE sales up 15 per cent 21 . We continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence in this market. There were also particularly strong performances in our China JV (APE sales up 34 per cent 21 ), Thailand (APE sales up 21 per cent 21 ) and Vietnam (APE sales up 35 per cent 21 ), demonstrating our channel strength in these markets.\n\nWe have also developed strategies to reach the digitally-savvy millennial segment through UOB Mighty, UOB's digital bank, and new partners such as Central in Thailand. Prudential Laos has also recently partnered with Star Fintech to launch payment services via its U-money platform. We anticipate that these partnerships will significantly enhance our reach to millennial consumers in the country through the/uni00A0joint development of digital propositions that encompass health, wellness and wealth products. The experience will also help us in designing and managing distribution strategies in our existing markets as well as in targeting new points of entry.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

For example, 46 per cent of/uni00A0Asian consumers searched for new insurance policies 23 . Our digital capabilities allow us to make healthcare more accessible and affordable in the countries where we operate.\n\nPrudential meets this growing demand for health and wellness through/uni00A0its super-app Pulse by Prudential. Pulse is a free digital mobile application that offers holistic management, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered self-help tools, and information to serve users 24/7 and/uni00A0promotes health and wellbeing through a range of value-added services. These include telemedicine, health and wellness content and/uni00A0communities, health challenges and rewards, chronic disease management, as well as a self-diagnosis and self-help tools. Pulse has been launched 27 in 11 different languages across 11 markets in Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan, and Myanmar) and most/uni00A0recently four markets in Africa (Kenya, Nigeria, Cameroon and/uni00A0Zambia), with varying levels of development.\n\nPulse has been downloaded around 20 million times 27 since its initial launch in 2019 in Malaysia. Through this single super-app, Pulse is being developed to offer an integrated health, wealth, and SME ecosystem. It has integrated 32 local and regional partners 27 , including most recently, a signed partnership with Central Group, a leading retailer in Thailand, that will enable Pulse to access Central Group's existing digital engagement with customers to offer insurance and health solutions to them. We have also signed a partnership with HR Easily, an HR services digital platform which we make available to our SME customers through 'Business at Pulse'. We are seeing continued increase in the usage of AI assessment and triage, lifestyle management and wellness, and telemedicine consultation services, with over 1.5 million users 27 accessing at least one of the services in/uni00A0Asia, since launch.\n\nPulse also enables us to reach a younger customer demographic, with/uni00A0the majority of Pulse users in the 18 to 35 age group compared with the average age of an existing Prudential customer profile of/uni00A0around 40, and is broadening our potential customer base, with/uni00A070 per cent of Pulse consumers new to Prudential.\n\nMeet your health assistant\n\n## Up your game with challenges\n\nAccessible anywhere, anytime\n\n37 digital bite-sized products were made available in Pulse in 2020. Some examples of bite-sized products launched by Prudential within Pulse include products related to common critical illnesses in Asia (cancer, stroke, heart attack), tropical disease protection (dengue, malaria, measles), and daily care (food poisoning, minor burns, broken bones, and accident income support).\n\nWith greater customer touchpoints, we are also able to generate Pulse-led data-driven leads for agents. We saw over 2.2 million leads generated for agents in 2020 which together with a small amount of revenue from policies sold directly through Pulse, generated APE sales of $211 million 28 in 2020.\n\nRecently, we introduced a subscription plan to help Pulse users eat healthier and promote a more active lifestyle, and even save for the future. These paid subscription plans, priced at a low cost of between $1-$3 per month, are currently available to users in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, with plans to expand on the offerings and launch in additional markets in 2021. The paid subscription plans have received 164,000 active subscribers during 2020.\n\nWe have undertaken steps to meet our objective for Pulse to provide a platform for end-to-end service, with the same app used by customers and distributors. Agents have the ability to sell Prudential products virtually within the Pulse platform in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Meanwhile, e-claims are available in Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines. We believe the integration with the life value chain across sales, claims and payments will allow Pulse to enhance value to new and existing users and drive efficiencies in the business.\n\n## Customer service and loyalty\n\nWe believe that excellent customer service has been key to our strong reputation and leading pan-Asia franchise. Customer loyalty has remained high during the Covid-19 pandemic, with a retention ratio consistently in excess of 90 per cent. The satisfaction and trust our customers have in our business also translates into a high proportion of/uni00A0repeat sales, which comprised 47 per cent of APE sales in 2020. The/uni00A0result of these dynamics is a portfolio of over 25 million in-force policies, with each policyholder holding 1.6 policies on average.\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2020, we added a/uni00A0further 1.3 million new life customers from traditional channels. Our overall life customer numbers increased to 16 million, of which about 30 per cent are our health insurance customers.\n\nWe continue to identify and target new customer groups and segments outside our traditional focus in the Mass and Affluent space in order to/uni00A0accelerate our future growth. Within the Emerging segment, Pulse/uni00A0leads the customer acquisition as described above. Within the high net worth segment, we first expanded into this segment in 2018 with Opus in Singapore, providing a differentiated experience for our customers, including a dedicated service team, wealth planners and external experts covering trust and legal matters. Within the Group segment, we also developed tailored offerings for small and mediumsized enterprise (SME), a segment that remains under-served and offers significant growth potential. This strategy is advanced through our all-inclusive platform, Business at Pulse platform, which provides digitally-enabled insurance and HR solutions for business owners and their employees, supporting a 17 per cent increase in APE sales from group business in 2020. We have extended our Business at Pulse platform from Singapore and Indonesia to Hong Kong, the Philippines and Thailand, and will launch next in Malaysia.\n\n## Integrated asset management\n\nEastspring is a leading Asia-based asset manager, with operations across 11 markets in Asia, plus offices in Europe and North America. With $247.8 billion of assets under management and over 300 investment professionals, it is the largest pan-Asian retail asset manager excluding Japan 2 and is a top-10 asset manager in 7 of/uni00A0the/uni00A011/uni00A0markets in which it operates.\n\nEastspring has a broad product set, as well as significant distribution capabilities and industry-leading operational efficiency. Eastspring provides focused investment solutions, across equity, bonds and multi-asset products, to our internally sourced life insurance funds and third-party retail and institutional clients. Distribution channels include wholesale, intermediary and direct online formats, which are tailored as required, depending on the geography involved. This means that Eastspring can continue to grow and develop through both market cycles and changes to individual investment styles. Operational efficiency has led to industry-leading margins, with investment in technology, for example the implementation of BlackRock's Aladdin system, to deliver common platforms, and world-class risk management and governance capabilities.\n\nIn terms of strategy, we see substantial growth opportunities to accelerate Eastspring, building on its leading market position as Asia's/uni00A0largest retail asset manager 2 (excluding Japan) and structural advantages of reliable and predictable inflows from our life business. In/uni00A0particular, we see China, India and Thailand as our most material market opportunities. Eastspring is well positioned to broaden its investment capabilities to serve the global needs of Asia-based clients, while offering global investors access to its expertise in investing in Asian markets. For example, in October 2020, Eastspring announced a strategic partnership with Atlantic Zagros Financial Partners to expand its offshore distribution capabilities to the Americas. To support this ambition Eastspring's strategic objectives include developing its distribution, product range and investment advisory capability, while/uni00A0continuing to enhance support for the asset management needs/uni00A0of Prudential's life insurance business.\n\nTo support these objectives, Eastspring has organised its operations into three pillars that will drive the expansion of its capabilities and growth in the future:\n\n- -Alpha engine - representing centralised investment capability with/uni00A0an emphasis on driving asset class return on investment after/uni00A0adjusting for market-related volatility. This pillar will focus on/uni00A0diversifying Eastspring's investment capabilities and styles.\n- -Advisory solutions - standalone advisory service for institutional clients; focusing on solutions and products for that market, including the growing need to support clients' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) requirements. This pillar will also focus on reinforcing the quality of service provided to the Group's life operations and supporting the Group's ESG strategy.\n- -Complementary partner solutions - this pillar will focus on complementary investment capabilities sourced from partners, in/uni00A0order to enhance strategies available to investors.\n\nIn developing its capabilities, Eastspring will further integrate its offerings with those of Prudential's life business, to enable the Group to seamlessly offer services across the full spectrum of Life, Health and/uni00A0Wealth products. Eastspring will leverage Prudential's established distribution channels.\n\nWe believe these developments will further enhance Eastspring's position as a leading asset manager in Asia.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is a growing awareness and demand for wellness and insurance products across Asia, re-enforced by the global pandemic. We continue to invest in our chosen markets, building on our leading position in Hong Kong and ASEAN, and meeting the growing needs of/uni00A0customers in the largest economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. This customer need is addressed by our wide range of insurance products, tailored to local markets, and extensive and diversified distribution network. We continue to amplify these existing capabilities through extending our China footprint, broadening our product offerings and enhancing our digital presence. Our innovative and customer-centric digital ecosystem increasingly complements our existing distribution channels and provides access to address the needs of new and fast-growing customer segments. Our overall customer offering is supported by our integrated asset manager Eastspring, which/uni00A0has a clear strategy to expand its capabilities to deliver growth.\n\nWe believe these enhanced capabilities, alongside the resilience of our/uni00A0high quality and well diversified platform, mean our Asia business is well positioned to capture the structural opportunities open to us and therefore deliver profitable and sustainable compounding growth and high risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## US operations\n\nJackson helps Americans grow and protect their retirement savings and income to enable them to pursue financial freedom for life. Following the planned demerger, Jackson intends to pursue a focused strategy which prioritises optimisation and stability of capital resources while protecting franchise value.\n\nMaintaining a resilient balance sheet is critical to Jackson meeting its/uni00A0objectives of fulfilling its obligations to policyholders, providing stable capital returns to shareholders, supporting the development of/uni00A0the business and enabling profitable growth over the long term.\n\nIn line with Jackson's disciplined approach to pricing and risk management, pricing actions taken in the first half of 2020 in response to changing market conditions and to preserve statutory capital, resulted in an expected and material reduction in/uni00A0new fixed annuity and fixed index annuities sales.\n\nJackson has identified three main areas for business development.\n\nFirst, Jackson intends to maintain and enhance its comprehensive suite/uni00A0of retirement products that it believes are sought after by retail investors and Jackson's distribution partners.\n\nSecond, it plans to optimise the sales mix across its broad product portfolio by leveraging the strength of its industry-leading distribution network and entering into new distribution agreements.\n\nThird, Jackson seeks to develop the overall market demand for retail annuities by partnering with wealth management solution providers that historically have not considered annuities as a solution to provide retirement savings and income protection.\n\nThese strategies are discussed further below.\n\n## Markets\n\nJackson believes that the US retirement savings and income solutions market presents a compelling growth opportunity and will support its/uni00A0development in the future. The primary drivers of the industry's trends are believed to be the following:\n\n- -The target demographic is expected to continue to grow. Over/uni00A0the next decade, the proportion of the US population aged 55/uni00A0or older is expected to grow at a rate double that of the total US/uni00A0population, resulting in approximately 112 million individuals who will be aged 55 or older by the year 2030 29 .\n- -The need for new sources of retirement income is expected to/uni00A0grow. Over the last few decades, there has been a pronounced shift from retirement income funded primarily by pension plans to/uni00A0retirement income funded primarily by individual savings. Of/uni00A0all/uni00A0private sector workers in the United States, only 15 per cent had access to a defined benefit pension plan in 2020 (down from 20 per cent in 2010), and 52 per cent only had access to a defined contribution retirement plan in 2020 30 . This trend has increased the burden on individuals to save for their retirement and to use those savings to generate income during retirement.\n\n- -Annuities are underutilised in the world's largest retirement savings market. The United States is the world's largest retirement savings market estimated to consist of approximately $51 trillion in/uni00A0professionally managed retail and institutional assets as of 31 December 2019 31 . However, only approximately $2.4 trillion of/uni00A0professionally managed assets were invested in annuities as of/uni00A031 December 2019. A key driver of this underutilisation is the historical lack of integration of annuities into wealth management platforms and financial planning tools available to retail investors. Jackson has been working actively with its distribution partners and/uni00A0financial technology firms to integrate annuities into the wealth management planning tools advisers use to select investments and/uni00A0build portfolios for their clients.\n\n## Products\n\nJackson offers a diverse suite of annuities to retail investors in the United States. The success of its variable annuity offerings reflects the/uni00A0differentiated features Jackson offers as compared with its competitors, in particular the wider range of investment options and/uni00A0greater freedom to invest across multiple investment options. Through the third quarter of 2020, Jackson accounted for 16.5 per cent/uni00A0of new sales in the US retail variable annuity market 32 and/uni00A0ranked number 1 in variable annuity sales. Jackson also offers fixed index annuities and fixed annuities and expects to offer a registered index-linked annuity in 2021. This diverse offering allows Jackson to/uni00A0meet the different needs of retail investors based on their risk tolerance and desired growth objectives, and to deliver customised, differentiated solutions to its distribution partners. Jackson's annuities offer investors the opportunity to grow their savings consistent with their objectives, ranging from full market participation with Jackson's variable annuities, to a guaranteed fixed return with Jackson's fixed annuities. Some of Jackson's annuities offer optional guarantee benefits for a fee, such as full or partial protection of principal, minimum payments for life and minimum payments to beneficiaries upon death. All annuities also provide investors with tax deferral benefits consistent with their purpose of providing financial security at,/uni00A0and through, retirement.\n\n## Distribution network\n\nJackson sells its products through an industry-leading distribution network that includes independent broker-dealers, wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, banks, and independent registered investment advisers, third-party platforms and insurance agents. Jackson's strong presence in multiple distribution channels has been essential to positioning it as a leading provider of retirement savings and income solutions. Each of these channels is supported by Jackson's sizeable wholesaler field force, which is among the most productive in the annuity industry. According to the Market Metrics Q3 2020 Sales, Staffing, and Productivity Report, Jackson's variable annuity sales per wholesaler are more than 10 per cent higher than its/uni00A0nearest competitor.",

Jackson administers approximately 75 per cent of its in-force policies on its in-house policy administration platform. Jackson's in-house policy administration platform gives it flexibility to administer multiple product types through a single platform. To date, Jackson has converted over 3.5 million life and annuity policies to its in-house policy administration platform, eliminating the burdens, costs and inefficiencies that would be involved in maintaining multiple legacy administration systems. The remainder of Jackson's business is administered through scalable third-party arrangements. Jackson believes that its operating platform provides it with a competitive advantage by allowing it to grow efficiently and provide superior customer service. In 2020, Jackson received the 2019 Contact Center of the Year award from Service Quality Management and the number 1 overall operational ranking for 2019 from its broker-dealer partners, according to the Operations Managers' Roundtable.\n\n## Risk management\n\nProduct design and pricing are key aspects of Jackson's risk management approach. Jackson operates a sophisticated hedging programme which seeks to balance three objectives: managing the economic impact of adverse market conditions, protecting statutory capital and providing stable distributable earnings throughout market/uni00A0cycles.\n\nJackson also uses third-party reinsurance to mitigate a portion of the risks that it faces, principally in certain of its in-force annuity and life insurance products with regard to longevity and mortality risks and its annuities with regard to the vast majority of its guaranteed minimum income optional benefit (GMIB) features.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Based on full year 2020 (calendar year 2020 for India), or the latest information available.

Alongside, we have accelerated preparations for the proposed separation of Jackson and continue to develop our capabilities and presence in our chosen Asia and Africa markets, which will position the Group well for success in the future.\n\nWhile Covid-19 restrictions led to new APE sales in Asia being (28) per cent 1 lower than the prior year, we have seen positive momentum in the second half of the year, with H2 2020 sales up 20 per cent 1 compared with the first half. Excluding Hong Kong, where restrictions between Mainland China and Hong Kong have been in place for much of 2020, new APE sales were down (6) per cent 1 , with new business profit falling by only (4) per cent 1 as new business profit margins saw a small improvement over the prior year. Our businesses in Asia delivered a 13 per cent 1 increase in adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns (adjusted operating profit 2 ), reflecting the benefits of our well positioned and broad-based portfolio, which has long focused on high quality, recurring premium business. Operating free surplus generation was 8 per cent 1 higher, following the on-going growth of the in-force business and lower levels of new business which were offset by the impact of lower interest rates.\n\nLower asset returns and the effect of lower interest rates on the economic assumptions underpinning DAC amortisation contributed to/uni00A0US long-term business adjusted operating profit 2 being (8) per cent lower than the prior year. The RBC ratio of Jackson National Life 24 , Jackson's principal operating subsidiary, was 347 per cent, with operating capital generation in line with expectations following the Athene reinsurance transaction. As announced on 28 January, the RBC ratio is after an 80 percentage point reduction following revisions to Jackson's hedge modelling for US regulatory purposes.\n\n2020 saw high levels of macro volatility. In the US, the S&P 500 index fell (4) per cent over the first half before recovering by 20 per cent in the second, resulting in a 16 per cent increase over the year. In Asia, equity indices were similarly volatile, with the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index (6) per cent down in the first half and up 30 per cent in the second. Government bond yields were lower over the year, notably with the US 10-year government bond yield ending the year at 0.9 per cent (31 December 2019: 1.9 per cent). 2020 also saw significant volatility in credit spreads, for example spreads on US dollar denominated A-rated corporate bonds rose by 39 basis points in the first half and fell by (41) basis points in the second half.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe Group Chief Executive's report has set out how the Group has risen to the operational challenges presented by Covid-19. In terms of/uni00A0financial performance, the containment measures taken by governments across the globe have impacted sales levels and consequentially new business profitability in 2020, albeit many business units saw sales improve in the second half of the year as restrictions were removed. These impacts are discussed in more detail later in this report. Future sales level will depend on how governments respond to changing Covid-19 case levels and the success of vaccination and containment programmes in the markets in which we/uni00A0operate. Travel between Hong Kong and Mainland China remains severely restricted, with consequential effects on Mainland China visitor numbers and the level of APE sales in Hong Kong from this segment. The impact that Covid-19 has had on the macro-economic environment, with lower interest rates and volatile equity markets, has/uni00A0negatively impacted profitability in the year as discussed below. The sensitivity of our IFRS, EEV and capital metrics to further market movements are set out in the financial statements later in this/uni00A0document.\n\nIn Asia, where we focus on health and protection business, we continue to see low levels of Covid-19 claims, which were less than 1 per cent of total Asia claims paid in the year of $7.2 billion. We also provided our customers in 2020 with premium grace periods in line with local regulations. Our annual review of non-economic assumptions underpinning insurance liabilities did not identify the need for any significant strengthening as a result of the effects of Covid-19 and overall Asia operating experience remains positive.",

        "page_content": "There have been no impairments to goodwill or intangible assets at/uni00A031 December 2020 and we will continue to review for triggers for/uni00A0impairment in line with our normal accounting procedures. Our/uni00A0investments are largely at fair value in the balance sheet and no significant changes to our valuation procedures have been applied. Losses on sales of impaired bonds by Jackson increased to $(148) million in the year (2019: loss of $(28) million) and bond write-downs increased to $(32) million (2019: $(15) million) reflecting volatility in credit spreads.\n\nFinally, our liquidity position remains healthy with $1.5 billion of holding company cash and $0.5 billion of commercial paper in issue at/uni00A031 December 2020 alongside $2.6 billion of undrawn committed facilities. We have not breached any of the requirements of our core structural borrowings nor modified any of their terms.\n\n## Adjusted operating profit before tax from continuing operations\n\nFor full year 2020, Prudential's adjusted operating profit 2,7 from continuing operations was $5,507 million (4 per cent higher than 2019/uni00A0on a constant and an actual exchange rate basis). Throughout this/uni00A0document the reference to continuing operations refers to results/uni00A0of/uni00A0the full Group in 2020 and the results of the Group in 2019 excluding/uni00A0the contribution from the discontinued UK life and asset management operations.\n\nThe increase in adjusted operating profit reflects the combination of a/uni00A013 per cent 1 increase in adjusted operating profit 2 from our Asia life and asset management operations, offset by a (9) per cent decrease in/uni00A0adjusted operating profit 2 from our US business (including asset management), and lower central expenses.\n\nCentral expenses 15 were 8 per cent 3 lower than the prior year reflecting/uni00A0a reduction in interest expense on core borrowings following the transfer of debt to M&G plc in 2019, partly offset by increased restructuring costs of $(208) million (2019: $(110) million 3 ). Restructuring costs reflect the Group's substantial and ongoing IFRS 17 project and costs associated with actions to reduce central costs post the demerger of M&G plc. During 2020 our head office activities incurred costs of $(417) million (2019: $(460) million 3 ). The Group continues to take action to right-size its head office costs alongside the/uni00A0evolving footprint of the business. The Group has delivered $180 million of cost savings effective from 1 January 2021 5 as previously targeted as a result of the M&G demerger 6 . In addition, as a/uni00A0result of the separation of Jackson from the Group, head office costs are targeted to reduce further by around $70 million from the start of/uni00A02023. We will continue to review the timing of the full realisation of these further savings following the completion of the US demerger.\n\n## Non-operating items from continuing operations 25\n\nNon-operating items in 2020 consist of short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business of negative $(4,841) million (2019: $(3,203) million 3 ), the net benefit from various corporate transactions of $1,521 million (2019: loss of $(142) million 3 ), which are discussed further below, and the amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments of negative $(39) million (2019: $(43) million 3 ) arising mainly from the REALIC business acquired by Jackson in 2012.\n\nNegative short-term fluctuations include negative $(607) million for Asia (2019: positive $657 million 3 ) and negative $(4,262) million in the US (2019: $(3,757) million).\n\nFalling interest rates in certain parts of Asia led to lower discount rates/uni00A0on certain policyholder liabilities under the local reserving basis/uni00A0applied, which were not fully offset by unrealised bond and equity gains in the year leading to negative fluctuations overall.\n\nWithin the US, falling interest rates, with yields on US treasuries falling by almost one percentage point over the year, and steeply rising equity markets following substantial falls in the first quarter of the year have led to $(4,262) million of negative short-term investment fluctuations in/uni00A0the US business. Further information is set out in the US section of this report.\n\nAfter allowing for non-operating items, the total IFRS profit after tax from continuing operations was $2,185 million (2019: $1,944 million 1 ).\n\n## IFRS effective tax rates\n\nIn 2020, the effective tax rate on adjusted operating profit based on/uni00A0longer-term investment returns from continuing operations was 15 per cent. This was unchanged from 2019.\n\nThe effective tax rate on total IFRS profit in 2020 was negative (2) per cent. This was unchanged from 2019 and reflects the tax credit/uni00A0on US derivative losses exceeding the tax charge on profits from/uni00A0Asia/uni00A0operations.\n\n## Total tax contribution from continuing operations\n\nThe Group continues to make significant tax contributions in the jurisdictions in which it operates, with $2,114 million remitted to tax authorities in 2020. This was similar to the equivalent amount of $2,168 million 3 remitted in 2019.\n\n## Tax strategy\n\nThe Group publishes its tax strategy annually which, in addition to complying with the mandatory UK (Finance Act 2016) requirements, also includes a number of additional disclosures, including a countryby-country disclosure of revenues, profits, average employee numbers and taxes for all jurisdictions where more than $5 million tax was paid. This disclosure is included as a way of demonstrating that our tax footprint (ie where we pay taxes) is consistent with our business footprint. An updated version of the tax strategy, including 2020 data, will be available on the Group's website before 31 May 2021.\n\n## Corporate transactions\n\n## Jackson reinsurance of fixed and fixed index annuity business in/uni00A0June 2020\n\nJackson reinsured substantially all of its in-force portfolio of US fixed and fixed index annuities with Athene (circa $27.6 billion of liabilities). The transaction excluded liabilities relating to Jackson's legacy life and institutional business, the REALIC portfolio and group pay-out annuity business reinsured from John Hancock as well as investments in the general account by the variable annuity policyholders. The transaction improved the year-end capital position of Jackson by increasing the Jackson RBC ratio by 67 percentage points and the Group's LCSM cover ratio by 24 percentage points. The reinsurance agreement was effective on 1 June 2020 and resulted in an IFRS pre-tax gain recorded through the profit and loss account of $804 million, after transaction costs and post-closing adjustments. After allowing for tax and the reduction in unrealised gains recorded directly in other comprehensive income, the/uni00A0impact of the reinsurance transaction on IFRS shareholders' equity is a reduction of $(1.2) billion. This transaction reduced the Group's EEV by $(457) million, which largely reflects the loss of future profits recorded in the value of in-force business as a result of the reinsurance and the loss of unrealised gains on assets passed to Athene, partly offset by the reinsurance commission received after deducting tax.\n\n## Equity investment into Jackson by Athene\n\nIn July 2020, Athene Life Re Ltd invested $500 million in Prudential's US business in return for an 11.1 per cent economic interest for which the voting interest is 9.9 per cent. This has no impact on the income statement but resulted in a decline in IFRS shareholders' equity of $(514) million at the date of the transaction.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Other transactions\n\nOther transactions in 2020 contributed $717 million to profit and principally include the reinsurance commission from a quota share reinsurance transaction undertaken by Hong Kong as part of the Group's on-going asset/liability management. Future surpluses (or/uni00A0losses) arising from the business being reinsured will be shared with the reinsurer in accordance with the terms of the treaty. Under EEV we recorded a loss of $91 million representing the frictional costs of the arrangement. This treaty helps mitigate the effect of the accounting mismatch under the existing regulatory framework in Hong Kong and is part of our management of the transition to the new RBC regime.\n\nIn the first half of the year, the Thailand business entered into a strategic bancassurance partnership with TMB Bank Public Company Limited with an initial period of 15 years which both expanded and extended the existing partnership with Thanachart Bank. The new\n\narrangement commenced on 1 January 2021 and the fee paid/uni00A0for expanding and extending the existing arrangement was $0.8 billion.\n\nIn January 2021, the Group announced its intention to complete the demerger of Jackson in the first half of 2021. The total costs associated with this activity are estimated to be around $110 million to $120 million, of which around half is expected to be borne by Prudential plc and the/uni00A0remainder by Jackson. These largely relate to advisory and other professional fees and a small amount relates to the separation of Jackson's systems and processes from those of the remaining Prudential Group.\n\nOf these total costs, $38 million has been incurred in 2020 ($20 million by Prudential plc and $18 million by Jackson) and has been included in non-operating profit as part of corporate transactions. The remainder of the costs are expected to be incurred in the first half of 2021.\n\n## IFRS profit\n\n|                                                                                                          | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                                                          | 2020  $m               | 2019  $m               | Change  %              | 2019  $m                 | Change  %                |\n| Adjusted operating profit based on longer-term investment returns  before tax from continuing operations |                        |                        |                        |                          |                          |\n| Asia                                                                                                     |                        |                        |                        |                          |                          |\n| Long-term business                                                                                       | 3,384                  | 2,993                  | 13                     | 2,978                    | 14                       |\n| Asset management                                                                                         | 283                    | 283                    | -

The primary legislation was enacted in July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will also come into operation on 29 March 2021. This legislation will be further supported by guidance material from the Hong Kong IA. The/uni00A0GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements.\n\nThe GWS methodology is largely consistent with that applied under/uni00A0LCSM with the exception of the treatment of debt instruments. Prudential's initial analysis indicates that all debt instruments (senior/uni00A0and subordinated) issued by Prudential will meet the transitional conditions set by the Hong Kong IA and will be included as/uni00A0eligible Group capital resources. If this were the case the 31 December 2020 shareholder LCSM ratio 10 (over GMCR) would increase by 35/uni00A0percentage points to 363 per cent. This is subject to/uni00A0final/uni00A0approval by/uni00A0the Hong Kong IA.\n\nThe estimated shareholder LCSM cover ratio 10 at 31 December 2020 was 328 per cent (31 December 2019: 309 per cent). Excluding US operations, the cover ratio falls marginally to 323 per cent, before including the proposed retained 19.9 per cent non-controlling interest in Jackson.\n\nOverall, LCSM shareholder surplus over group minimum capital requirements increased by $1.5 billion since 31 December 2019 to $11.0 billion at the end of December 2020. LCSM in-force operating capital generation in the year was $2.2 billion, which supported $(0.2) billion of investment in new business.\n\nOverall non-operating items (excluding corporate transactions) reduced surplus by $(0.2) billion, with the negative effect of market movements in the year being offset by a $2.2 billion benefit from the/uni00A0introduction of the new Singapore risk-based capital framework (RBC2) effective 31 March 2020. Also included within non-operating items is a $(0.4) billion fall in surplus from changes made to Jackson VM-21 hedging model, further details of which are set out in the US section in the discussion of RBC changes.\n\nThe corporate transactions previously discussed were positive overall and contributed $0.5 billion to surplus and the payment of the 2019 second interim and 2020 first interim dividends reduced the surplus by/uni00A0$(0.8) billion.\n\nThe Group's LCSM position is resilient to external macro movements as demonstrated by the sensitivity disclosure contained in note I(i) of/uni00A0the Additional unaudited financial information, alongside further information on the basis of calculation of the LCSM measure.\n\n## Estimated Group LCSM capital position 10\n\n|                                                      | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2019   | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                      | Total         | Shareholder * | Total         | Shareholder * |\n| Available capital ($ billion)                        | 37.9          | 15.8          | 33.1          | 14.0          |\n| Group minimum capital requirement (GMCR) ($ billion) | 11.5          | 4.8           | 9.5           | 4.5           |\n| LCSM surplus (over GMCR) ($ billion)                 | 26.4          | 11.0          | 23.6          | 9.5           |\n| LCSM ratio (over GMCR) (%)                           | 329%          | 328%          | 348%          | 309%          |\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

This/uni00A0reflected the issuance of $1,000 million 3.125 per cent notes in April 2020 raised for general corporate purposes including to support the growth of the business. The Group had central cash resources of $1.5 billion at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $2.2 billion), resulting in net core structural borrowings of the shareholder-financed businesses of $5.2 billion at end of December 2020 (31 December 2019: $3.4 billion). Prudential plc seeks to maintain its financial strength rating which derives, in part, from the high level of financial flexibility to issue debt and equity instruments which is intended to/uni00A0be/uni00A0maintained and enhanced in the future.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group's net gearing ratio as defined in the table above was 20 per cent. We estimate that this will rise to circa 28 per cent post the separation of Jackson (based on the balance sheet at 31 December 2020, assuming no pre-separation dividend and before allowing for the 19.9 per cent retained stake in Jackson). On a Moody's basis, which is the basis management intend to use going forward to manage leverage and which differs to the above by taking into account gross debt, including commercial paper, and also allows for a proportion of the surplus within the Group's with-profits funds, the equivalent ratio is 33 per cent, before allowing for the 19.9 per cent retained stake in Jackson. Following the demerger, as a pure-play Asia and Africa business, Prudential will target a Moody's debt-leverage ratio of around 20 to 25 per cent 4 over the medium term. Prudential may operate outside this range temporarily to take advantage of growth opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns as they arise, while still preserving its strong credit ratings.\n\nAs discussed in the Chief Executive's report, Prudential is considering raising new equity of around $2.5-3 billion. Such a transaction, if/uni00A0executed, would maintain and enhance the Group's financial flexibility in light of the breadth of the opportunities to invest in growth/uni00A0and aim to increase the Group's investor base in Asia.\n\n## Other sources of liquidity\n\nIn addition to its net core structural borrowings of shareholderfinanced businesses set out above, the Group has access to funding via/uni00A0the medium-term note programme, the US shelf programme (the/uni00A0platform for issuance of SEC-registered bonds in the US market), a/uni00A0commercial paper programme and committed revolving credit facilities. All of these are available for general corporate purposes.\n\nPrudential plc has maintained a consistent presence as an issuer in the/uni00A0commercial paper market for the past decade and had $501 million in issue at the end of 2020 (31 December 2019: $520 million).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had a total of $2.6 billion of undrawn committed facilities, expiring in 2025. Apart from small drawdowns to test the process, these facilities have never been drawn, and there were no amounts outstanding at 31 December 2020.\n\nIn addition to the Group's traditional sources of liquidity and financing, Jackson also has access to funding via the Federal Home Loan Bank of/uni00A0Indianapolis with advances secured against collateral posted by Jackson. Given the wide range of Jackson's product set and breadth of/uni00A0its customer base including retail, corporate and institutional clients, further sources of liquidity also include premiums and deposits.\n\n## Group free surplus generation from continuing operations 9\n\nFree surplus generation is the financial metric we use to measure the/uni00A0internal cash generation of our business operations and is based (with adjustments) on the capital regimes that apply locally in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates. For life insurance operations, it represents amounts emerging from the in-force business during the year, net of amounts reinvested in writing new business. For/uni00A0asset management and other non-insurance operations (including the Group's central operations and Africa operations) it is taken to be/uni00A0IFRS basis shareholders' equity, net of goodwill attributable to shareholders, with central Group debt shown on a market value basis and subordinated debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it/uni00A0is/uni00A0cla ssified as available capital under the Group's capital regime.",

In order to support the planned separation process, there were no remittances from Jackson during the period. $55 million remittances from other operations reflects intragroup interest income which is not expected to recur.\n\nCash remittances were used to meet central costs of $(435) million and/uni00A0to pay dividends of $(814) million. Central costs include net interest paid of $(294) million and a net tax benefit, which is not expected to recur going forward, of $94 million.\n\nOther movements of $(264) million include the proceeds of the issuance of $1 billion of senior debt in April 2020 offset by central contributions to the funding of Asia strategic growth initiatives, principally payments for bancassurance distribution agreements, including TMB and UOB. Further information is contained in note I(iii) of the Additional unaudited financial information.\n\nCash and short-term investments totalled $1.5 billion at the end of/uni00A0December 2020 (31 December 2019: $2.2 billion 3 ).\n\nThe Group will seek to manage its financial condition such that it/uni00A0has/uni00A0sufficient resources available to provide a buffer to support the/uni00A0retained businesses in stress scenarios and to provide liquidity to/uni00A0service central outflows.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nReflecting the Group's capital allocation priorities, dividends will be/uni00A0determined primarily based on Asia's operating capital generation after allowing for the capital strain of writing new business and recurring central costs, with a portion of capital generation retained for reinvestment in the business. Dividends are expected to grow broadly in line with the growth in Asia operating free surplus generation net of right-sized central costs, and will be set taking into account financial prospects, investment opportunities and market conditions.\n\nThe Board has approved a 2020 second interim ordinary dividend of/uni00A010.73 cents per share. Combined with the first interim ordinary dividend of 5.37 cents per share the Group's total 2020 dividend is/uni00A016.10 cents per share.\n\nStarting from the 2021 first interim dividend, the Board intends to/uni00A0apply a formulaic approach to first interim dividends, which will/uni00A0be/uni00A0calculated as one-third of the previous year's full-year ordinary/uni00A0dividend.",

While Covid-19 related containment measures impacted our new sales and associated new business profit levels, we also delivered a step-change in our digital capabilities. While the nature and severity of Covid-19 restrictions varied significantly across our markets, our/uni00A0enhanced digital and physical capabilities combined with our diversified and high quality platform supported a strong sequential quarterly recovery in sales in the third and fourth quarters of the year/uni00A0from a low in the second quarter, illustrating the strength of our/uni00A0franchise.\n\nThe resilience and quality of our business is also evident in customer retention levels of 90 per cent (2019: 90 per cent), which combined with our recurring premium, health and protection focused business model, with renewal premiums 8 increasing 6 per cent 1 to $20.1 billion, supported an overall 13 per cent 1 increase in adjusted life insurance operating profit 2 and an 8 per cent 1 increase in operating free surplus/uni00A0generation 9,12 .\n\nThese qualities enabled us to continue to grow scale and value, even/uni00A0in/uni00A0more challenging operating conditions, with our overall Asia embedded value increasing to $44.2 billion at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $39.2 billion 3 ).\n\n|                                     | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                     | 2020  $m               | 2019  $m               | Change  %              | 2019  $m                 | Change  %                |\n| New business profit                 | 2,201                  | 3,522                  | (38)                   | 3,533                    | (38)                     |\n| Adjusted operating profit *         | 3,667                  | 3,276                  | 12                     | 3,256                    | 13                       |\n| EEV operating profit *              | 4,387                  | 6,138                  | (29)                   | 6,150                    | (29)                     |\n| Operating free surplus generation * | 1,895                  | 1,772                  | 7                      | 1,762                    | 8                        |\n\n## New business performance\n\n## Life EEV new business profit and APE new business sales (APE sales)\n\n|                                | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Actual exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   | Constant exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                | 2020  $m               | 2020  $m               | 2019  $m               | 2019  $m               | Change  %              | Change  %              | 2019  $m                 | 2019  $m                 | Change  %                | Change  %                |\n|                                | APE  sales             | New  business  profit  | APE  sales             | New  business  profit  | APE  sales             | New  business  profit  | APE  sales               | New  business  profit    | APE  sales               | New  business  profit    |\n| Hong Kong                      | 758                    | 787                    | 2,016                  | 2,042                  | (62)                   | (61)                   | 2,037                    | 2,063                    | (63)                     | (62)                     |\n| China JV                       | 582                    | 269                    | 590                    | 262                    | (1)                    | 3                      | 590                      | 262                      | (1)                      | 3                        |\n| Indonesia                      | 267                    | 155                    | 390                    | 227                    | (32)                   | (32)                   | 379                      | 220                      | (30)                     | (30)                     |\n| Malaysia                       | 346                    | 209                    | 355                    | 210                    | (3)                    | -

Outside Hong Kong, overall new business APE sales were (6) per cent 1 lower and new business profit decreased by (4) per cent 1 .\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 related disruption varied materially in terms of/uni00A0severity and duration across the region. Restrictions eased in many markets as the year progressed. In Mainland China internal travel and business activity resumed from the end of March and restrictions in Hong Kong eased from the end of August, though the border between Mainland China and Hong Kong remains closed. In Indonesia, after an initial relaxation of lockdown measures in June, a further four-week period of lockdown was imposed between mid-September and mid-October and the country re-entered lockdown again in early 2021. Significant containment restrictions remain in place in Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand, with reduced restrictions in/uni00A0place in Hong Kong domestic, Taiwan, Singapore and India.\n\nOver 2020, we continued to benefit from the resilience our diverse platform provides. Our diverse geographic portfolio saw four markets increase APE sales compared with the prior year, including Thailand up/uni00A016 per cent 1 , Taiwan up 11 per cent 1 and Vietnam up 9 per cent 1 . This is also evident from a new business profit perspective, with seven markets reporting growth, led by China JV up 3 per cent 1 among our larger markets and Thailand and Vietnam, up 38 per cent 1 and 18 per cent 1 respectively, in other markets.\n\nOutside of Hong Kong, sales from our bancassurance channel were/uni00A0stable with last year, underpinned by growth in China JV (APE/uni00A0bancassurance sales up 34 per cent 1 ), Thailand (up 21 per cent 1 ), Indonesia (up 15 per cent 1 ) and Vietnam (up 35 per cent 1 ). We also saw/uni00A0increased agency momentum in the second half of the year.\n\nThere has been a significant acceleration of our digital capabilities over/uni00A02020, with virtual sales accounting for 27 per cent of bank sales from July to December and 28 per cent of all agency sales from April to/uni00A0December. This compares with very low amounts in prior years. Our/uni00A0agency channel was supported by over 2.2 million of 'online to offline' leads generated by our Pulse health and wealth super-app, which, together with direct sales in Pulse, generated $211 million of/uni00A0APE sales 23 in the year.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report on the 2020 financial performance / continued\n\nThe quality and diversity of our platform contributed to a strong sequential recovery in APE sales as Covid-19 related restrictions were/uni00A0lifted, with discrete third quarter production of $925 million 1 sequentially 33 per cent 1 higher than the second quarter and fourth quarter sales 18 per cent 1 above the third quarter and 10 per cent 1 higher than the first quarter of 2020, prior to Covid-19 restrictions being applied in many of the markets in which we operate.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 was the highest APE sales quarter of the year for overall Asia and for nine markets. As we pivoted to standalone protection products of lower case size to meet rising consumer demand, total new policies increased by 1 per cent and new protection policies grew by 10 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in the prior year.\n\nThe development of new business profit mainly reflects the impact of/uni00A0change in geographic mix, particularly sharply lower APE sales in Hong Kong where the reduction in new business profit was broadly in/uni00A0line with APE sales. Outside Hong Kong, new business profit was only (4) per cent 1 lower compared with a (6) per cent 1 reduction in APE/uni00A0sales, with improved new business margins partly driven by new health and protection product launches which saw seven markets increasing their health and protection mix. Health and protection products continue to be a significant proportion of sales, contributing 27 per cent of APE sales in 2020 (2019: 27 per cent).\n\nOverall, Hong Kong APE sales were (63) per cent 1 below the prior year. This was principally a result of a very sharp reduction in APE sales to Mainland China customers, reflecting the impact of the border closure early in the year and consequent reduction in Mainland Chinese visitors and associated APE sales to these customers. While domestic Hong Kong APE sales were also impacted by Covid-19 related restrictions, new business production improved markedly over the course of the year, with APE sales in Q3 rising 20 per cent over Q2 and/uni00A0Q4 rising 60 per cent over Q3. The strong sequential sales growth was supported by product innovation and ongoing development of/uni00A0our broader digital capabilities. In particular, our increased focus on/uni00A0standalone protection products, with lower case sizes, to meet rising consumer demand saw domestic new sales policy count reach/uni00A098 per cent of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. Overall Hong/uni00A0Kong new business profit was (62) per cent 1 lower, broadly in/uni00A0line with the reduction in APE sales.\n\nOur China JV delivered an encouraging performance despite Covid-19 related disruption, increasing new business profit by 3 per cent 1 . This/uni00A0was supported by the agency force focus on protection products, which accounted for 53 per cent of sales from this channel and as/uni00A0a/uni00A0result agency channel margins climbed to 85 per cent (2019: 74 per cent). We benefited materially from our diversified distribution model, particularly the strength in bancassurance which saw strong and accelerating growth of 34 per cent in APE sales throughout the year. Overall APE sales were only (1) per cent 1 lower compared with the prior year and second half APE sales 4 per cent 1 higher than the prior year.\n\nThe sales environment in Indonesia remained challenging following a deterioration of Covid-19 infections through the summer, culminating in the re-introduction of the highest-level movement restrictions in September, which remain in place today in parts of Indonesia. Despite the challenging environment, we achieved strong performance in the sharia segment with APE sales growing 6 per cent and new business profit 27 per cent. Meanwhile, the fourth quarter saw the highest overall sales of 2020 (19 per cent higher than APE sales in the first quarter) and was driven by 60 new products launched in 2020, including lower ticket standalone protection products. While this product strategy saw new sales case count rise by 12 per cent at FY20, overall APE sales volumes were (30) per cent 1 below the prior year driving a similar reduction in new business profit.\n\nIn Malaysia, APE sales were (1) per cent 1 below the prior year, with a decline in the first half sales largely offset by a recovery in the second half of 14 per cent (compared with the second half of the prior year), despite the reintroduction of partial Covid-19 related restrictions in October, driven by strong agency production across our traditional and takaful markets. The Takaful business grew APE sales by 26 per cent compared with 2019, with new business profit increasing by 29 per cent. Overall new business profit increased by 1 per cent 1 , reflecting our increased focus on standalone smaller case size protection products.\n\nIn Singapore, APE sales fell by (7) per cent 1 reflecting Covid-19 restrictions with declines in the first half of the year partly offset by an/uni00A0increase in the second half of 5 per cent 1 when compared with the second half of the prior year. Strong agency momentum following the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions saw APE sales in the second half of/uni00A0the year being 63 per cent higher than the level in the first half. New/uni00A0business profit reduced by (11) per cent 1 , as lower interest rates resulted in a lower margin. Singapore continues to develop products and digital capabilities with the launch in December of three bite-sized digital products on Pulse (PRUSafe Dengue, PRUSafe BreastCancer, PRUSafe ProstateCancer) and the onboarding of the PRUCancer360 product on UOB's Mighty banking app.\n\nWe have made good initial progress with our recent investment in distribution in Thailand, where our APE sales were up 16 per cent\u00b9, reflecting strong growth of 21 per cent in bancassurance channel. New business profit grew by a stronger 38 per cent, supported by the/uni00A0product mix shift to health and protection which accounted for 25 per cent of APE sales (2019: 16 per cent). Our distribution capability will be further strengthened by our partnership with TMB which commenced on 1 January 2021 and our digital partnership with The1, Thailand's largest loyalty platform.",

The expected return was (9) per cent 1 below the prior year reflecting the impact of lower interest rates in reducing the risk discount rate under our active basis European Embedded Value methodology. Reflecting the high quality of our in-force business and/uni00A0prudent assumption setting, operating assumption changes and/uni00A0operating experience variances are again positive, driven by product repricing effects as well as positive claims variances across our/uni00A0businesses, among other factors.\n\nAsset management segment operating profit after tax was up 3 per cent 1 on the prior year at $253 million (2019: $246 million 1 ), which/uni00A0is discussed in more detail below.\n\nThe non-operating profit of $822 million (2019: $1,968 million 1 ) largely comprises increases in asset values following the fall in interest rates and higher equity markets, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on expectations of future asset returns.\n\nOverall, Asia segment embedded value increased by 13 per cent 3 to/uni00A0$44.2 billion in the 12 months to 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $39.2 billion 3 ). Of this, $42.8 billion (31 December 2019: $37.8 billion 3 ) relates to the value of the long-term business and includes our share of our India associate valued using embedded value principles which is lower than its market capitalisation. The remainder represents Asia asset management and goodwill attributable to shareholders which are carried at IFRS net asset value within the Group's EEV. At 31 December 2020, 47 per cent (31 December 2019: 48 per cent 3 ) of total Asia long-term embedded value excluding goodwill is attributable to Hong Kong.\n\n## Total embedded value for Asia long-term business operations, excluding goodwill\n\n|                                                                                                         | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Free surplus                                                                                            | 5,295             | 3,624             |\n| Required capital                                                                                        | 3,445             | 3,182             |\n| Net worth                                                                                               | 8,740             | 6,806             |\n| Value of in-force business before deduction of cost of capital and time value of options and guarantees | 36,729            | 32,396            |\n| Cost of capital                                                                                         | (749)             | (866)             |\n| Time value of options and guarantees *                                                                  | (1,912)           | (493)             |\n| Net value of in-force business                                                                          | 34,068            | 31,037            |\n| Embedded value                                                                                          | 42,808            | 37,843            |\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Excluding the effect of operating assumption changes and experience variances, in-force free/uni00A0surplus generation was in line with the prior year 1 with the growth of the in-force portfolio being dampened by the effect of lower interest rates compared with the prior year. Operating assumption changes and experience variances were positive, again illustrating the high quality nature of the in-force business.\n\nInvestment in new business was $(559) million, 9 per cent 1 below that in 2019. This reflects lower APE sales volumes, offset by business mix effects and lower interest rates.\n\nOverall higher in-force generation and lower investment in new business led to operating free surplus generated 9 before restructuring costs increasing by 8 per cent 1 to $1,895 million.\n\nThe non-operating profit of $444 million includes the benefit of the reinsurance transaction undertaken by Hong Kong as part of the Group's on-going asset/liability management as discussed earlier under corporate transactions. 2019 non-operating profits included $278 million 3 of gains from the reduction in the Group's stake in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company and the disposal of Prudential Vietnam Finance Company.\n\n## Local statutory capital\n\nWe maintained a strong balance sheet with a shareholder LCSM surplus over the regulatory minimum capital requirement of $8.2 billion and coverage ratio of 338 per cent at 31 December 2020\n\n(31 December 2019: $4.7 billion and 253 per cent). If our with-profits funds in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia are added the surplus increases to $23.6 billion (31 December 2019: $18.8 billion). We seek to safeguard our business from market volatility through our strong focus on protection products and our prudent asset and liability management strategy.\n\n## IFRS profit\n\nOverall Asia adjusted operating profit 2 increased by 13 per cent 1 to/uni00A0$3,667 million, driven by a 14 per cent 1 increase in life insurance adjusted operating profit 2 , alongside a 2 per cent 1 increase at/uni00A0E a s t spring.\n\nThis growth reflects the benefits of our focus on high quality recurring/uni00A0premium business, which accounts for 90 per cent of our new business, and diversified portfolio of scale businesses, with over 88 per cent of our total life income 14 (excluding other income described below) driven by insurance margin and fee income (2019: 86 per cent 1 ), again supporting profit progression across market cycles.\n\nOur Asia life insurance adjusted operating profit 2 growth is broad-based and at scale. Overall, nine insurance markets reported double-digit growth 1 , with three insurance markets delivering growth/uni00A0of 20 per cent 1 or more. At a market level, highlights include Hong/uni00A0Kong up 20 per cent 1 to $891 million, Singapore up 18 per cent 1 to $574 million, Malaysia up 14 per cent 1 to $309 million, China up/uni00A015 per cent 1 to $251 million and Thailand up 24 per cent 1 to $210 million. Adjusted operating profit 2 in Indonesia was $519 million, marginally lower than the prior year.",

on high-quality drivers. The overall 14 per cent 1 growth in Asia life insurance adjusted operating profit 2 to $3,384 million (2019: $2,978 million 1 ) was driven principally by 19 per cent 1 growth in insurance margin-related revenues and reflects our ongoing focus on recurring premium health and protection products and the associated continued growth of our in-force business.\n\nFee income was in line with the prior year, while spread income decreased by (7) per cent 1 driven by lower interest rates in the year.\n\nWith-profits earnings relate principally to the shareholders' share in bonuses declared to policyholders. As these bonuses are typically weighted to the end of a contract, under IFRS, with-profits earnings consequently emerge only gradually over time. The 9 per cent 1 growth in with-profits earnings reflects the ongoing growth in these portfolios.\n\nOther income primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses. As such, the (2) per cent 1 decrease from 2019 largely reflects lower new business volumes, whereas new business acquisition expense fell 12 per cent 1 to $(1,904) million. The ratio of shareholder acquisition costs to shareholder-related APE sales (excluding with-profits-related sales) increased to 68 per cent (2019: 66 per cent on an actual exchange rate/uni00A0basis), reflecting changes to product and geographical mix. Administration expenses, including renewal commissions, increased by 8 per cent 1 reflecting in-force business growth.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Compared with 2019, Eastspring's average funds under management increased by 6 per cent 3 (7 per cent 16 on a/uni00A0constant exchange rate basis). Funds under management were 13 per cent 3 higher than at the end of June ($219.7 billion 3 ) as equity markets recovered and asset flows began to recover from the volatility in the first half.\n\nEastspring continues to benefit from strong, positive net flows from internal insurance funds, recording $8.5 billion (2019: $9.7 billion). Overall third-party flows related to external funds under management were negative $(10.0) billion, reflecting the adverse impact of higher market volatility, as a result of Covid-19, on retail funds, most notably in/uni00A0a number of retail bond funds in Thailand in the first half of 2020. Highlights included strong flows into our China A Fund, and Global Innovation Fund in respect of our equity products, and Income Plus and Active Bond Fund Plus on the fixed income side. As market volatility subsided over the second half of the year, third-party net flows 22 improved materially, with the fourth quarter seeing net inflows of $0.5 billion. In addition, as anticipated, there were net outflows from funds managed on behalf of M&G plc of $(10.0) billion in 2020, with further outflows of around $(6) billion expected in the first half of 2021.\n\nEastspring's adjusted operating profit 2 of $283 million was up 2 per cent compared with the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis (level on an actual exchange rate basis). Operating income (net/uni00A0of/uni00A0commission) increased by 1 per cent 3 with the benefit of higher average funds under management being partly offset by adverse client and asset mix effects that reduced the fee margin based on operating income to 28 basis points (2019: 30 basis points 3 ). Cost discipline remains robust, with operating costs in line with the prior year, with/uni00A0the/uni00A0resulting cost/income ratio 8 the same at 52 per cent.\n\n## Return on segment equity\n\nThe benefit of our focus on profitable health and protection, with-profit and asset management businesses is evident in/uni00A0the attractive 26 per cent (2019: 30 per cent) operating return delivered on/uni00A0average segment equity 8 over 2020.",

(which we refer to/uni00A0as Jackson), the entity that is proposed to be demerged, except for the discussion on local statutory capital which covers Jackson Financial Inc.'s subsidiary, Jackson National Life, only. Post its separation from/uni00A0the Group, Jackson will no longer publish EEV results and the discussion below therefore focuses on IFRS and capital measures. All/uni00A0amounts have been prepared on the basis of the Prudential Group's accounting policies and methodologies and are consistent with the Group's reporting in 2019. This will differ from the financial information that Jackson will report as part of the demerger process, which will be prepared under US GAAP and will include certain non-GAAP financial measures which Jackson management believes will be more relevant to manage the business as a standalone entity.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, Jackson National Life's RBC ratio was 347 per cent (31 December 2019: 366 per cent). At the point of proposed separation, Jackson expects to have an RBC ratio 24 in excess of 450 per cent and total financial leverage 21 in the range of 25 to 30 per cent, subject to market conditions. Jackson expects to achieve this level of RBC at the point of separation by contributing proceeds of its debt and hybrid capital raising to its regulated insurance subsidiaries.\n\n|                                    | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   | Change  %   |\n|------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| APE new business sales (APE sales) | 1,923      | 2,223      | (13)        |\n| Adjusted operating profit *        | 2,796      | 3,070      | (9)         |\n| RBC ratio (%)                      | 347        | 366        | (19) ppts   |\n\n## New business APE sales\n\n|                                       | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   | Change  %   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Variable annuities                    | 1,662      | 1,470      | 13          |\n| Fixed annuities                       | 33         | 119        | (72)        |\n| Fixed index annuities                 | 100        | 382        | (74)        |\n| Total retail annuity APE sales        | 1,795      | 1,971      | (9)         |\n| Total institutional product APE sales | 128        | 252        | (49)        |\n| Total APE sales                       | 1,923      | 2,223      | (13)        |\n\nDespite challenging market conditions, Jackson delivered a 13 per cent increase in variable annuity sales, reflecting the strength and depth of/uni00A0its leading distribution franchise and value-added customer proposition. Jackson believes that the investment freedom and optional guaranteed benefits Jackson offers its customers support its/uni00A0strong brand recognition with distributors and advisers 18 .\n\nJackson has maintained its leading position in the US retail variable annuity market 19 . This market position reflects the attractiveness of its/uni00A0product, breadth of distribution across multiple channels, and the productivity of Jackson's wholesaler field force, which is among the most productive in the industry, with sales per agent over 10 per cent higher than the nearest competitor 20 .\n\nIn line with Jackson's disciplined approach to pricing and risk management, pricing actions taken in the first half of 2020 in response to changing market conditions and to preserve statutory capital, resulted in an expected and material reduction in new fixed annuity and fixed index annuities sales, evident particularly from the beginning of the second quarter. This, combined with lower institutional sales, resulted in an overall (13) per cent reduction in APE sales.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

This reduction largely reflects the impact of DAC adjustment effects in the current and prior year, alongside the expected reduction in spread related earnings following the reinsurance contract with Athene in June 2020.

The margin of 112 basis points benefited from prior year swap transactions. Excluding that benefit,/uni00A0the spread margin would have been 88 basis points (2019:/uni00A0101/uni00A0ba sis points).\n\nInsurance margin represents profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and profits from the legacy life businesses and was marginally lower than that earned in 2019.\n\nAcquisition costs have fallen by 8 per cent following lower sales in/uni00A0the/uni00A0year. Administration expenses increased by 4 per cent to $(1,744) million in 2020 as a result of higher asset-based commissions, as average separate account balances increased, and the non-recurrence of commission income (treated as a negative expense) earned under the/uni00A0John Hancock reinsurance arrangement in 2019. Excluding the asset-based commission, the administration expense ratio would be 34/uni00A0basis points (2019: 33 basis points).\n\nDAC adjustments, being the cost deferred on sales in the period net/uni00A0of/uni00A0amortisation of amounts deferred previously, have fallen by $(193) million to $317 million. This follows lower deferrals from lower sales and higher amortisation of prior period DAC. DAC amortisation increased as the impact of changes to the longer-term economic assumptions underpinning the amortisation calculation, following an expectation of lower interest rates in the future, more than offset the benefits of increases in DAC deceleration in the period as a result of higher equity markets at the end of 2020 as compared with the start of/uni00A0the year.\n\n## Non-operating items\n\nThe non-operating result was negative $(3,510) million pre-tax (2019:/uni00A0$(3,795) million) and contributed to a net loss after tax of $(247) million (2019: $(380) million). The non-operating result over 2020 includes a/uni00A0loss of $(4,296) million from short-term investment fluctuations and/uni00A0amortisation of previous acquisition accounting adjustments offset/uni00A0by a $786 million pre-tax gain as a result of the Athene reinsurance transaction.\n\nIn the US, Jackson provides certain guarantees on its annuity products, the value of which would typically rise when equity markets fall and/uni00A0long-term interest rates decline. Jackson charges fees for these guarantees which are in turn used to purchase downside protection, in/uni00A0particular options and futures to mitigate the effect of equity market/uni00A0falls.\n\nJackson designs its hedge programme to protect the economics of the business from large movements in investment markets and does not seek to hedge on an accounting basis. It therefore accepts a degree of/uni00A0variability in the accounting results.\n\nThe $(4,296) million discussed above principally arises from the steep rise in equity markets following the low at the end of the first quarter of 2020 that led to equity derivative losses taken out as part of Jackson's hedging programme being in excess of the corresponding reduction in/uni00A0guarantee liabilities and the effect of lower interest rates on the value of its guarantees. Hedge costs were also elevated due to the high levels of volatility observed in the period.",

This is lower than 2019 which benefited from a $355 million release of incremental reserves following the integration of the John Hancock business acquired in 2018. The/uni00A0impact of new business improved by $182 million, largely as/uni00A0a/uni00A0result of expected fall in fixed annuity and fixed index annuity/uni00A0sales following repricing actions in the first half of 2020.\n- -Non-operating items reduced surplus by $(1,947) million driven primarily by the impact of market movements where falling interest rates, rising equity markets and elevated volatility have combined to result in derivative losses, net of reserve changes, and an increase in required capital. This included a reduction of $(193) million in deferred tax assets being admitted into statutory surplus and an increase in surplus of $140 million from changes in respect of formal recognition by the regulator of guaranteed asset management revenue.\n- -Surplus benefited from a $500 million investment by Athene and a/uni00A0fur ther $775 million as a result of the reinsurance of the in-force fixed annuity and fixed index annuity portfolio in June.\n- -At 31 December 2019, Jackson early adopted the provisions of the/uni00A0National Association of Insurance Commissioners Valuation Manual Minimum Standards No. VM-21 (VM-21). As announced on 28 January 2021, Jackson determined that a simplifying modelling assumption was not consistent with its intent in the adoption of VM-21 and the revised modelling adopted for calculating reserves and capital reduced surplus by $(390) million through a reduction in TAC and an increase in CAL.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Our governance, processes and controls enable us to deal with uncertainty effectively, which is critical to the achievement of our strategy of capturing long-term structural opportunities and helping our customers achieve their longterm financial goals.\n\nThis section explains the main risks inherent in our business and how/uni00A0we manage those risks, with the aim of ensuring an appropriate risk profile is maintained. Although Jackson is preparing to be a fully independent business, until the proposed demerger is effected Jackson's risks (as with those of the Group's other businesses) will continue to be managed within the Group Risk Framework and this report reflects this position.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n## The Group\n\n2020 was a truly eventful year. The Covid-19 pandemic swept across the world and has resulted in significant humanitarian suffering and material and prolonged disruption to social and economic activity. The/uni00A0business had to consider and navigate the risks arising from the Covid-19 on multiple fronts. These included capital and liquidity risks arising from abrupt market dislocation as well as risks associated with the disruption to the Group's operations across Asia, Africa, the US and UK. Concurrently, the business has maintained uninterrupted delivery of services for its policyholders, and has been committed to doing the right thing for both its customers and employees throughout the crisis. The Risk, Compliance and Security function has successfully transitioned into, and maintained, new ways of working across multiple time zones to provide strong stewardship and enhanced monitoring of/uni00A0these risks during the most acute phases of the pandemic's impact.\n\nThrough these extraordinary circumstances, the function has also provided risk opinions, guidance and assurance on critical activity, including Athene's reinsurance of $27.6 billion of Jackson's fixed and fixed index annuity portfolio and $500 million equity investment into Prudential's US business, the proposed demerger of Jackson from the/uni00A0Group and the revision to its hedge modelling for US statutory standards for calculating reserves and capital. At the same time, the/uni00A0function retained its focus on managing the risks of the ongoing business, performing its defined role in providing risk management support and oversight, as well as objective challenge to ensure the Group remained within its risk appetite.\n\nThe Group continues to engage constructively with the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA) as its Group-wide supervisor and is transitioning to a new supervisory framework. The Group's mature and/uni00A0well-embedded risk framework will enable decisions to be taken with confidence as the business seeks to capture the opportunities in/uni00A0the growth markets in which it is now focused while continuing to/uni00A0operate prudently with discipline.\n\n## The world economy\n\nAt the start of 2020 the prospects for global growth appeared to be improving. This positive momentum was abruptly reversed by the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to the shutdown of much of the world's economy and a sharp recession. In response to this unprecedented shock, governments and central banks deployed massive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to mitigate the impact on the labour force and restore confidence in financial markets. Driven largely by the strong macro policy response, global economies have started to recover although this remains far from complete. In Asia, China has been leading the economic rehabilitation, benefiting other Asian economies to an extent, although the regional recovery to date has been highly uneven. The economic environment in Asia is expected to/uni00A0remain challenging given the limited headroom for additional conventional monetary easing, increasing inflation risks from weaker foreign exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, and increasing fiscal pressures. Viewed more broadly, the pandemic has increased the debt/uni00A0burden of many economies and may result in sovereign debt sustainability issues, increasing the dependence on low interest rates by governments.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Financial markets\n\n2020 began with risk assets performing well until concerns over the/uni00A0economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak dented investor confidence, eventually leading to a global sell-off that unfolded at extraordinary speed. The S&P 500 index plunged by 35 per cent from/uni00A0an all-time high on 19 February 2020 to its low point on 23 March/uni00A02020. Interest rates in major markets declined significantly, falling to historical lows as investors fretted over the risks to the economic outlook. Credit spreads widened significantly, in line with/uni00A0the plunge in/uni00A0equity markets.\n\nThe stress on financial markets was broadly eased by the central banks maintaining accommodative monetary policies and implementing various support programmes. Since their trough in March 2020, financial markets have rallied strongly, initially driven by broad reductions in infection rates in some countries, optimism with respect to the restart of the global economy, and, in the US, a small group of large-cap stocks that has buoyed the cap-weighted index. Risk assets in particular continued to rally strongly in the second half of/uni00A02020.\n\nRisk asset valuations appear elevated and display some disconnect with economic fundamentals, and may therefore be subject to the risk/uni00A0of a correction given the renewed lockdowns implemented across/uni00A0the world towards the end of 2020 and into 2021, the logistical challenges to the roll out of Covid-19 vaccination programmes (which may be more prolonged than initially anticipated) and the development of/uni00A0new strains of the coronavirus. On interest rates, the consensus outlook is of an environment in which they will remain low-for-longer. The US Federal Reserve's forward guidance has constrained expectations of higher short-term yields in the foreseeable future, while economic fundamentals and globally accommodative conditions are likely to keep downward pressure on long-term yields. For credit assets, risks of a further round of widespread pressure on corporate liquidity - as experienced during 2020 - remain, given the stretched credit fundamentals of corporate borrowers, although the magnitude of the pre-funding and liquidity-raising that has been accomplished in/uni00A02020 is expected to mitigate this to an extent.\n\n## (Geo)political landscape\n\nDuring the first half of 2020, the civil unrest increasingly seen in many places across the world was partially curtailed by the Covid-19 restrictions put in place by governments. The second half of/uni00A0the year, saw an increase in popular protests against long-standing social issues and inequalities and were in some cases triggered by national elections in the US, Africa and Asia. An observable trend in recent protest movements, aided by social media, is the speed and frequency at which they can gather momentum and their evolving forms of leadership. The stability of governments is likely to be tested in different ways and potentially on a more frequent basis as a result, as/uni00A0will the resilience of businesses. As a global organisation, the Group has well-established local and global plans to mitigate the business risks from disruption. These have operated well when deployed across the Group during the/uni00A0Covid-19 crisis and also locally during the outbreaks of unrest seen/uni00A0during 2020 and continued into 2021 in markets where the Group operates. Operational resilience will continue to be critically evaluated and enhanced as the longer-term lessons from the pandemic response in particular, become clearer. Governmental responses to the pandemic have involved a necessary balancing of the impacts to people's health and/uni00A0lives, their individual rights and liberties, and economic growth. These considerations, and the dynamics between and within them, have become increasingly politicised and another source of polarisation and popular discontent which, in some places, have/uni00A0also/uni00A0provided impetus to protest movements.\n\nMany governments continue to face the challenge of reconciling the inter-connectedness of the global economy with pressure to prioritise national self-interests. The experience of the pandemic may provide a/uni00A0fur ther impetus to the regionalisation or fragmentation of global trade, investment and standards, and risks undermining efforts in international cooperation and coordination. Into 2021, accessibility to Covid-19 vaccine supplies, which may become a prolonged challenge, has the potential to contribute to an increase in geopolitical tensions. A/uni00A0key source of geopolitical risk during 2020 was the US-China relationship and its wider impact on international relations, and this/uni00A0looks likely to/uni00A0continue during President Biden's term in office. Hong/uni00A0Kong's perceived level of autonomy will remain influential in/uni00A0geopolitical tensions, with potential global trade and economic consequences. Responses by the US, UK and other governments to/uni00A0the enactment and application of the national security law in Hong Kong and other constitutional or legislative changes in the territory, which continue to/uni00A0develop, may impact Hong Kong's economy.\n\nBeing a key market for the Group which also hosts regional and head/uni00A0office functions, this could potentially impact Prudential's sales, operations and product distribution. For internationally active groups which operate across impacted jurisdictions such as Prudential, these government responses and measures add to the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance. Compliance with Prudential's legal or regulatory obligations in one jurisdiction may conflict with the law or policy objectives of another jurisdiction, or may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives of that jurisdiction over another, creating additional legal, regulatory compliance and reputational risks for the/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Regulations\n\nPrudential operates in highly regulated markets, and the nature and/uni00A0focus of regulation and laws remain fluid. A number of national and/uni00A0international regulatory developments are in progress, with a continuing focus on solvency and capital standards, conduct of business, systemic risk regulation, corporate governance and senior management accountability, and macroprudential policy. Some of these changes will have a significant impact on the way that the Group operates, conducts business and manages its risks. With geopolitical tensions elevated, the complexity of sanctions compliance is increasing and continues to represent a challenge for international businesses. These regulatory developments will continue to be monitored at a national and global level and form part of Prudential's engagement with government policy teams and regulators. The immediate regulatory and supervisory responses to Covid-19 have been broad and have included increased scrutiny of the operational resilience, liquidity and capital strength (including the impact of making dividend payments) of financial services companies as well as/uni00A0changes that have helped the Group to continue to support its customers through non-face-to-face contact. The financial burden in addressing the pandemic is likely to influence changes in governmental fiscal policies, laws or regulations aimed at increasing financial stability, and this may include measures on businesses or specific industries to/uni00A0contribute to, lessen or otherwise support, the financial cost to governments of treating patients and meeting the logistical challenges of providing vaccines. It is possible that requirements are imposed on private insurance companies and healthcare providers to cover costs associated with the treatment and prevention of Covid-19 beyond contractual or policy terms.",

        "page_content": "Against this evolving regulatory backdrop, constructive engagement continues with Prudential's Group-wide supervisor, the Hong Kong IA, on the Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework. The GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements. The primary legislation was enacted in July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The framework adopts a principle-based and outcome-focused approach, and allows the Hong Kong IA to exercise direct regulatory powers over the holding companies of multinational insurance groups, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a preferred base for large insurance groups in Asia Pacific and a global insurance hub. During 2020, the Hong Kong IA engaged with the Group and/uni00A0other relevant stakeholders in the development of the GWS Framework, which will be anchored on/uni00A0the/uni00A0requirements for three pillars: capital, risk and governance, and/uni00A0disclosure.\n\n## Societal developments\n\nThe experience of the pandemic has underlined the ability of evolving demographic, geographical and environmental factors to change the/uni00A0nature, likelihood and impact of extreme events. These factors can/uni00A0also drive public health trends such as increasing obesity, with/uni00A0consequential potential impacts to Prudential's underwriting assumptions and product design. While insights can be gleaned from the current pandemic, the unique set of variables associated with extreme events means that their impact on the functioning of society, and the disruption to business operations, staff, customers and sales, cannot be predicted or fully mitigated. The Group has been actively managing the impact of the crisis as it has developed over 2020 and into 2021, including assisting affected policyholders and staff in meeting their resulting needs.\n\nIn support of increased ease of access and social inclusion, and to meet/uni00A0evolving customer needs, the Group is increasing its use of digital services, technologies and distribution methods for the products and services that it offers. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated these developments, with the Group's businesses having implemented virtual face-to-face sales of select ranges of products in many of its markets, and adoption of Prudential's Pulse application has continued to increase. The digital health platform is now available in 15 markets in/uni00A011 languages, with total downloads having reached 20 million as of/uni00A0February 2021. Changes to the Group's use of technology and distribution models have broad implications, touching on Prudential's conduct of/uni00A0business, increasing the risks of technology and data being compromised or misused and potentially leading to new and unforeseen regulatory issues.\n\nA strong sense of purpose for an enterprise is a driver of long-term profitability, and this is making companies evaluate their place in, and/uni00A0contribution to, society. The 'why and how' a business acts has/uni00A0become arguably at least as important as what it produces or the/uni00A0services that it provides. Understanding and managing the environmental, social and governance (ESG) impact and requirements of its business is fundamental to Prudential's brand, reputation and ultimately its long-term success. Ensuring high levels of transparency and responsiveness to stakeholders is a key aspect of this. Recent events have highlighted the structural inequalities in our societies and are prompting organisations to question where they stand on these important issues. Prudential's ESG Strategic Framework is designed to/uni00A0deliver on its purpose of 'helping people get the most out of life'. It/uni00A0includes a focus on inclusivity: inclusivity of access to quality healthcare, protection and savings for our customers; inclusivity of the/uni00A0working environment for our people; and inclusivity in the Group's support of the transition to low-carbon in the economies, markets and communities in which it operates.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The original Data Collection exercise, released in March for the purpose of monitoring the build-up of systemic risk for insurers, is paused for 2020. In April 2020, the IAIS also releases the requirements for the 2020 ICS and Aggregation Method Data Collection exercises.\n\n- The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) comes into force/uni00A0on 1 January 2020, creating data privacy rights to California consumers. Jackson ensures compliance with the Act in December 2019. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) implements changes to the US statutory reserve and capital framework for variable annuities, effective from 1 January 2020. Jackson chooses to early adopt the changes as at 31 December 2019 for US statutory reporting.\n- The Covid-19 pandemic shuts down much of the world's economy and triggers a sharp recession. Equity markets sell off at an extraordinary speed, volatility spikes, credit spreads widen sharply and interest rates in major markets decrease to new historical lows. Central banks maintain accommodative monetary policies and implement various asset purchase and support programmes to restore confidence in financial markets. Governments deploy massive fiscal stimulus to mitigate the economic fallout and the unprecedented shock on the labour force.\n- The Network for Greening the Financial System publishes its Guide for Supervisors in May 2020 which outlines recommendations for integrating climate-related and environmental risks into prudential supervision.\n\nMarkets rally sharply during Q2 on the back of asset purchases, direct intervention by the US Federal Reserve in credit markets, stimulus programmes, the gradual rebound in economic activity enabled by the progressive easing of lockdown measures and a/uni00A0broad reduction in virus infection rates.\n\n- A broad easing of Covid-19 restrictions begins to take place across many countries in the latter half of Q2 and into Q3, including in/uni00A0some countries with high infection rates, with many countries taking steps to mitigate a second wave of infections. Other countries, such as the US and those in Central and South America and South Asia continue to see high daily case numbers.",

This is followed by a further announcement in January 2021 confirming that the separation will be facilitated by way of demerger, which is proposed to complete in Q2 2021.\n- The Insurance (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance, being the enabling primary legislation providing for the GWS Framework was enacted on 24 July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will also come into operation on 29 March 2021. The GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon/uni00A0designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements.\n- The US Federal Reserve adopts a new flexible average inflation targeting strategy and introduces new forward guidance on interest/uni00A0rates that delays future increases until the economy reaches maximum employment and inflation rises to 2 per cent and is on track/uni00A0to moderately exceed this level for some time.\n\n## Q4 2020\n\nCovid-19 cases surge in Q4 across the US and Europe. Towards the end of 2020, major European economies start to reintroduce restrictions on movement and business to various degrees. Amid this increase in infection rates, vaccine approvals and/uni00A0roll-outs begin to take place in the UK and other countries.\n\n- Against the backdrop of the US election and positive Covid-19 vaccine news, equity markets continue to rally in November and volatility reaches new post-March lows. Central banks of major economies keep interest rate levels on hold. In Europe, the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme resolves to continue bond purchases until June 2021. In the US, a second stimulus package worth $900 billion passed in December.\n- The US elections take place amid a surge in coronavirus case numbers across the country. After legal challenges from President Trump are denied by the courts and the storming of the US Capitol buildings by protestors, Joe Biden is inaugurated as the 46th US/uni00A0president on 20 January 2021, taking control of both houses of/uni00A0Congress.\n\nOn 15 November, at the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Leaders Summit, 15 countries formally sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal, making it the world's largest trading bloc. Signatories aim to work through ratification of the deal in 2021. The RCEP comprises all/uni00A0ten ASEAN economies, plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- US GDP increases by $1.6 trillion over Q3, partially offsetting the/uni00A0decrease of $2.0 trillion in Q2, as consumer spending rebounds strongly. Meanwhile, China's GDP growth improves from 3.2 per cent year-on-year in Q2 to 4.9 per cent in Q3. Growth in all major investment activities return to positive levels, with real growth rising from -1.1 per cent year-on-year in August to 2.4 per cent in/uni00A0September.\n\nVolatility in the financial markets remain elevated. Equity markets briefly fall in September, accompanied by a sell-off in US treasuries, although this is short-lived and avoids a collapse of similar levels as seen in March. As credit market conditions stabilise, central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB), lower the pace of their asset purchases.\n\n- A new national security law for Hong Kong is implemented on/uni00A030 June 2020. The US response includes enactment of the Hong/uni00A0Kong Autonomy Act which introduces potential sanctions on financial institutions doing significant business with Chinese officials materially contributing to the alleged erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Over Q3 and Q4 the US introduces sanctions on a range of individuals and entities in connection to a number of issues.\n\nOn 31 July 2020, Carrie Lam postpones the September LegCo elections for one year, citing coronavirus concerns.\n\n- Moves to ban an opposition party in 2019 trigger antiestablishment protests in Thailand in early 2020. Protest activity peaks in mid-October and spikes again mid-November, with protest leaders threatening to resume demonstrations with increased intensity in early 2021.\n\nIn the run-up to the Uganda presidential elections on 14 January 2021, violence breaks out in Kampala with dozens killed in the first few weeks of electoral campaigning.\n\nIn early October, Nigeria is rocked by the outbreak of nationwide demonstrations against police brutality that leaves a reported 56/uni00A0people dead.\n\n- On 23 October, China's Central Bank, the People's Bank of China,/uni00A0publishes a draft banking law recognising, and providing a regulatory framework for, its planned central bank digital currency, the/uni00A0digital/uni00A0yuan.\n- On 11 November 2020, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee determines that Hong Kong LegCo members can be disqualified on various grounds including endangering national security, with four members being immediately disqualified. In protest, the remaining 15 member pro-democracy bloc resign en/uni00A0ma sse.\n\nOn 30 December 2020, the EU and China reach an agreement in principle on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which/uni00A0covers market access.

Risk governance\n\n## a  System of governance\n\nPrudential has in place a system of governance that promotes and embeds a clear ownership of risk, processes that link risk management to/uni00A0business objectives and a proactive Board and senior management providing oversight of risks. Mechanisms and methodologies to review, discuss and communicate risks are in place together with risk policies and standards to enable risks to the Group to be identified, measured and assessed, managed and controlled, monitored and reported.\n\nMaterial risks are retained selectively when it is considered that there/uni00A0is/uni00A0value in doing so, and where it is consistent with the Group's risk appetite and philosophy towards risk-taking. The Group Risk Framework, which is owned by the Board, details Prudential's risk/uni00A0governance, risk management processes and risk appetite. The/uni00A0Group's risk governance arrangements are based on the 'three lines of defence' model, comprising risk taking and management, risk/uni00A0control and oversight, and independent assurance.\n\nThe aggregate Group exposure to its key risk drivers is monitored and/uni00A0managed by the Risk, Compliance and Security function, which is/uni00A0responsible for reviewing, assessing, providing oversight and reporting on the Group's risk exposure and solvency position from the/uni00A0Group economic, regulatory and ratings perspectives.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has continued to review and update its policies and processes for alignment with the requirements of its Group-wide supervisor. The Group has also focused on development of its Group-wide customer conduct risk framework and policy; its/uni00A0AI/uni00A0ethics principles; and enhancements to its operational resilience.\n\nThe following section provides more detail on our risk governance, risk/uni00A0culture and risk management process.",

Risk governance and culture\n\nPrudential's risk governance comprises the Board organisational structures, reporting relationships, delegation of authority, roles and/uni00A0responsibilities, and risk policies that have been established to/uni00A0make decisions and control activities on risk-related matters.\n\nThe risk governance structure is led by the Group Risk Committee, supported by independent Non-executive Directors on risk committees of the Group's main subsidiaries. The Group Risk Committee reviews and approves changes made to the Group Risk Framework and to relevant policies. It also reviews and approves new risk policies and recommends to the Board any material policies which require Board approval. A number of core risk policies and standards support the Framework to enable risks to the Group to be identified, measured and/uni00A0assessed, managed and controlled, monitored and reported.\n\nThe risk governance arrangements for the Group's major businesses were delayered and strengthened in 2020 with the implementation of/uni00A0direct lines of communication, reporting and oversight of the risk committees of these businesses by the Committee. To support the enactment of these arrangements, the terms of reference for the major business risk committees were aligned and approved locally, and include a standing invitation for the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer (CRCO) and the requirement for risk escalations to the Committee.\n\nCulture is a strategic priority of the Board, which recognises its importance in the way that the Group does business. A Group-wide culture framework is currently being implemented to unify the Group towards its shared purpose of helping people get the most out of life. Components of the framework include principles and values that define how the Group expects business to be conducted in order to achieve its/uni00A0strategic objectives, inform expectations of leadership and guide ESG/uni00A0activities. The culture framework components are intended to be supportive of sound risk management practices by requiring a focus on/uni00A0longer-term goals and sustainability, the avoidance of excessive risk/uni00A0taking and highlighting acceptable and unacceptable behaviours. The/uni00A0framework is supported through inclusion of risk considerations in/uni00A0performance management for key individuals; the building of appropriate skills and capabilities in risk management; and by ensuring that employees understand and care about their role in managing risk through open discussions. The Group Risk Committee has a key role in providing advice to the Remuneration Committee on risk management considerations to be applied in respect of executive remuneration.\n\nPrudential's Group Code of Business Conduct and Group Governance Manual include a series of guiding principles that govern the day-to-day conduct of all its people and any organisations acting on its behalf. This is supported by specific risk-related policies which require that the Group act in a responsible manner. These include, but are not limited to, policies related to financial crime covering anti-money laundering and sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption. The Group's third-party supply policy requires that human rights and modern slavery considerations are embedded across all of its supplier and supply chain arrangements. Embedded procedures to allow individuals to speak out safely and anonymously against unethical behaviour and conduct are also in place.",

        "page_content": "ESG is overseen by the Board, which is responsible for determining strategy and prioritisation of key focus areas. In order to provide greater senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to the Group, in 2020, a Group ESG Committee was established. The Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer in his role as ESG sponsor, was/uni00A0supported by senior functional leaders and representatives from the Group's business units, including the chief investment officers of/uni00A0the Group's asset managers. The Group ESG Committee reported to/uni00A0the Board in 2020 through the Group Nomination & Governance Committee, comprising the Group's Chair, the Senior Independent Director, and the chairs of the Audit, Remuneration and Risk committees and was/uni00A0regularly attended by the Group Chief Executive. The policies and procedures to support how the Group operates in relation to certain ESG topics are included in the Group Governance Manual, which establishes standards for managing ESG issues across the Group and/uni00A0sets out the policies and procedures to support how Prudential operates. Further details on the Group's ESG governance arrangements, including the establishment in early 2021 of a Board Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, are included in the ESG/uni00A0Report on pages 74 to 76.\n\n## ii.  The risk management cycle\n\n## Risk identification\n\nIn accordance with provision 28 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, a process is in place to support Group-wide identification of the/uni00A0Company's emerging and principal risks and this combines both top-down and bottom-up views of risks at the level of the Group and/uni00A0its business units. The Board performs a robust assessment and analysis of these principal and emerging risks facing the Company through the risk identification process, the Group Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) report and the risk assessments undertaken as part of the business planning review, including how they are managed and mitigated, which supports decision-making.\n\nThe ORSA is the ongoing process of identifying, measuring and assessing, managing and controlling, monitoring and reporting the risks to which the business is exposed. It includes an assessment of capital adequacy to ensure that the Group's solvency needs are met at/uni00A0all times. Stress and scenario testing, which includes reverse stress testing requiring the Group to ascertain the point of business model failure, is another tool that helps to identify the key risks and scenarios that may have a material impact on the Group. The risk profile is a key output from the risk identification and risk measurement processes and is used as a basis for setting Group-wide limits, management information, assessment of solvency needs, and determining appropriate stress and scenario testing. The Group's annual set of principal risks is given enhanced management and reporting focus.\n\n## Risk measurement and assessment\n\nAll identified risks are assessed based on an appropriate methodology for that risk. All quantifiable risks, which are material and mitigated by/uni00A0holding capital, are modelled in the Group's internal model, which is/uni00A0used to determine economic capital requirements and is subject to/uni00A0independent validation and processes and controls around model changes and limitations.\n\n## Risk management and control\n\nThe Group's control procedures and systems focus on aligning the levels of risk-taking with the Group's strategy and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Risk management and control requirements are set out in the Group's risk policies and define the Group's risk appetite in respect of material risks and the framework under which the Group's exposure to those risks is limited. The processes to enable Group senior management to effect the\n\nmeasurement and management of the Group material risk profile in a consistent and coherent way, which include the flows of management information required, are also set out in the Group's risk policies. The methods and risk management tools that the Group employs to mitigate each of its major categories of risks are detailed in section 5 below.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nThe identification of the Group's principal risks informs the management information received by the Group Risk Committee and/uni00A0the Board. Risk reporting of key exposures against appetite is/uni00A0also/uni00A0included, as well as ongoing developments in the Group's principal and emerging risks.\n\n## iii.  Risk appetite, limits and triggers\n\nThe Group recognises that interests of its customers and shareholders, and a managed acceptance of risk in pursuit of its strategy, lies at the heart of its business, and that effective risk management capabilities represent a key source of competitive advantage. Qualitative and/uni00A0quantitative expressions of risk appetite are defined and operationalised through risk limits, triggers and indicators. The Risk, Compliance and Security function reviews the scope and operation of/uni00A0these measures at least annually. The Board approves changes to the Group's aggregate risk appetite and the Group Risk Committee has/uni00A0delegated authority to approve changes to the system of limits, triggers and indicators.\n\nGroup risk appetite is defined and monitored in aggregate by the setting of objectives for its liquidity, capital requirements and non-financial risk exposure, covering risks to shareholders, including those from participating and third-party business. Group limits operate within these expressions of risk appetite to constrain material risks, while triggers and indicators provide additional defined points for escalation. The Group Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing the risks inherent in the Group's business plan and for providing the Board with input on the risk/reward trade-offs implicit therein. This review is/uni00A0supported by the Risk and Compliance function, which uses submissions from local business units to calculate the Group's aggregated position relative to Group risk appetite and limits.\n\n- -Capital requirements. Limits on capital requirements aim to ensure that the Group maintains sufficient capital in excess of internal economic capital requirements in business-as-usual and stressed conditions, achieves its desired target rating to meet its business objectives, and supervisory intervention is avoided. The two measures currently in use at the Group level are the regulatory local capital summation method (LCSM) capital requirements (both/uni00A0minimum and prescribed levels) and internal economic capital requirements (ECap), which under the GWS Framework will/uni00A0be determined by the Group Internal Economic Capital Assessment (GIECA). In addition, capital requirements are monitored on local statutory bases.\n- -Liquidity. The objective of the Group's liquidity risk appetite is to ensure that sufficient cash resources are available to meet financial obligations as they fall due in business-as-usual and stressed scenarios. This is measured using a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) which considers the sources of liquidity against liquidity requirements under stress scenarios.\n\nNon-financial risks. The Group is exposed to non-financial risks, including environmental, social and governance risks, as an outcome of its chosen business activities and strategy. It aims to manage these/uni00A0risks effectively to maintain its operational resilience and its/uni00A0commitments to customers and other external stakeholders, and/uni00A0to/uni00A0avoid material adverse impact on its reputation.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The Group's principal risks\n\nBroadly, the risks assumed across the Group can be categorised as/uni00A0those relating to its financial situation; its business and industry; regulatory and legal compliance; and those relating to ESG. Principal risks, whether materialising within the Group or at third parties on which the Group relies, may have a financial impact and could also impact the performance of products or services provided to customers and distributors and the ability to fulfil commitments to customers, giving rise to potential risks to its brand and reputation. These risks, which are not exhaustive, are detailed below. The materiality of these risks, whether material at the level of the Group or its business units, is/uni00A0also indicated. The Group's disclosures covering risk factors are aligned to the same categories and can be found at the end of this/uni00A0document.\n\nIn reading the sections below, it is useful to understand that there are/uni00A0some risks that Prudential's policyholders assume by virtue of the/uni00A0nature of their products, and some risks that the Group and its shareholders assume. Examples of the latter include those risks arising/uni00A0from assets held directly by and for the Group or the risk that policyholder funds are exhausted. This report is focused mainly on risks to the shareholder but will include those which arise indirectly through policyholder exposures.\n\n## Covid-19 risks and responses\n\nThe Group has responded in a number of ways to the risks arising from/uni00A0the coronavirus pandemic; some responses were part of existing risk management processes and procedures, while others have been initiated specifically in response to the pandemic, in particular during the acute phases experienced in Q1 and Q2.\n\nThe Group Critical Incident Procedure (GCIP) defines specific governance to be invoked in the event of a critical incident, such as a/uni00A0significant market, liquidity or credit-related event. This includes, where necessary, the convening of a Critical Incident Group (CIG) to oversee, coordinate, and where appropriate, direct any activity during a critical incident. In response to the economic and financial market shocks triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic the Group CRCO invoked the GCIP and convened a series of CIG meetings to provide highcadence monitoring and management of potential threats to the capital or liquidity position of the Group. Local Incident Management teams were also activated to monitor and manage the tailored response required to support the operations, customers and employees of the Group's businesses.\n\nThese risks arising from Covid-19, and the Group's responses to them, are summarised below, with further information provided, where relevant, within the descriptions of the Group's principal risks.\n\n| Risk areas                                                                                                                                                                                       | Responses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Staff safety and wellbeing                                                                                                                                                                       | Proactive move to working from home arrangements across jurisdictions, with Local Incident  Management teams monitoring country-specific developments, undertaking risk assessments  and providing regular staff communications and support.                                            |\n| Customer outcomes are not met,  increasing/uni00A0conduct risk                                                                                                                                   | Initiatives and campaigns rolled out across markets, including customer cash benefits,  goodwill/uni00A0payments, and extended grace periods for premium payments.                                                                                                                      |\n| Disruption to the operations of the Group,  and its key partners                                                                                                                                 | Application of the Group and local business continuity plans.

        "page_content": "## Risks to the Group's financial situation (including those from the external macroeconomic and geopolitical environment)\n\nThe global economic and geopolitical environment may impact on the Group directly by affecting trends in financial markets and asset values, as well as driving short-term volatility. Risks in this category include the market risks to our investments and the credit quality of our investment portfolio as well as liquidity risk.\n\n## Global economic and geopolitical conditions\n\nChanges in global economic conditions can impact Prudential directly; for example, by leading to reduced investment returns and fund performance and liquidity, and increasing the cost of promises (guarantees) that have been made to the Group's customers. Changes in economic conditions, such as the abrupt and uncertain longer-term impacts resulting from the Covid-19 crisis, can also have an indirect impact on the Group; for example, leading to a decrease in/uni00A0the propensity for people to save and buy Prudential's products, as/uni00A0well as changing prevailing political attitudes towards regulation.\n\nThe geopolitical environment can also impact the Group in a wide range of ways, both directly and indirectly. Financial markets and economic sentiment have been highly susceptible to geopolitical developments in recent years, with implications for the Group's financial situation. We have seen in recent times that geopolitical tensions can result in the imposition of protectionist or restrictive regulatory and trading requirements by governments and regimes. The Covid-19 pandemic has further prompted governments to rethink the current globalised nature of supply chains, while accessibility to vaccine supplies has the potential to contribute to an increase in geopolitical tensions. These factors may have geopolitical and trading implications, the full extent of which may not be clear for/uni00A0a while. Various governments have effected, or may effect, the/uni00A0postponement of elections and other constitutional or legislative processes in response to the pandemic, and the longer-term impact from this increase in constitutional and political uncertainty remains to be seen. The pandemic has had a negative impact on all economies, with increased fiscal burdens, higher levels of borrowing\n\n## Market risks to our investments\n\n(Audited)\n\nThis is the potential for reduced value of Prudential's investments resulting from the volatility of asset prices, driven by fluctuations in/uni00A0equity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and property prices. Interest rates in the Group's key markets decreased to historically low levels in Q1 2020, with the stance of central banks making it likely they will remain extremely low for a while. A/uni00A0persistently low interest rate environment poses challenges to both/uni00A0the capital position of life insurers as well as to new business profitability and this is a scenario that the Group is planning for.\n\nThe Group has appetite for market risk where it arises from profit-generating insurance activities to the extent that it remains part/uni00A0of a/uni00A0balanced portfolio of sources of income for shareholders and is compatible with a robust solvency position.\n\nand reduced revenues. These pressures will impact on the business operating environments, for example, through changes to taxation, and are likely to contribute to political pressures for governments.\n\nResponses by the US, UK and other governments to the enactment and application of the national security law in Hong Kong and other constitutional or legislative changes in the territory, which continue to develop, may impact Hong Kong's economy. Being a key market for the Group which also hosts regional and head office functions, this could potentially impact Prudential's sales, operations and product distribution. For internationally active groups which operate across impacted jurisdictions such as Prudential, these government measures and responses add to the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance. Compliance with Prudential's legal or regulatory obligations in one jurisdiction may conflict with the law/uni00A0or/uni00A0policy objectives of another jurisdiction, or may be seen as/uni00A0supporting the law or policy objectives of that jurisdiction over another, creating additional legal, regulatory compliance and reputational risks for the Group. All these factors can increase the operational, business disruption, regulatory and financial market risks to the Group and can directly impact its sales and distribution networks. Developments in Hong Kong and the continuing impacts of the pandemic are being closely monitored by the Group and plans/uni00A0have been enacted to manage the disruption to the business, its/uni00A0employees and its customers within existing business resilience processes. Further information on the Group's business disruption risks are included below.\n\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical risks are considered material at/uni00A0the/uni00A0level of the Group.\n\nThe Group's market risks are managed and mitigated by the following:\n\n- -The Group market risk policy;\n- -The Group Asset Liability Committee - a first-line risk management advisory committee to the Group Chief Executive Officer which supports the identification, assessment and management of key financial risks significant to the achievement of the Group's business objectives;\n- -Risk appetite statements, limits and triggers;\n- -Asset and liability management programmes which include management actions such as asset allocation, bonus revisions, repricing and the use of reinsurance where appropriate;\n- -Hedging derivatives, including equity options and futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions and currency forwards;\n- -The monitoring and oversight of market risks through the regular reporting of management information; and\n- -Regular deep dive assessments.\n\nAs noted above, in response to the economic and financial market shocks triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group CRCO invoked the GCIP and convened a series of CIG meetings to provide high-cadence monitoring and management of any potential threats to the capital or liquidity position of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Risks to the Group's financial situation (including those from the external macroeconomic and geopolitical environment) continued\n\n## Market risks to our investments continued (Audited)\n\nEquity and property investment risk . In Asia, the shareholder exposure to equity price movements results from unit-linked products, where fee income is linked to the market value of the funds under management. Further exposure arises from with-profits businesses where bonuses declared are based broadly on historical and current rates of return from the Asia business's investment portfolios, which include equities.\n\nIn Jackson, investment risk arises from the assets backing customer policies. Equity risk is driven by the variable annuity business, where/uni00A0the assets are invested in both equities and bonds and the main risk to the shareholder comes from providing the guaranteed benefits offered. The exposure to this is primarily controlled by using/uni00A0a derivative hedging programme, as well as through the use of/uni00A0reinsurance to pass on the risk to third-party reinsurers.\n\nBasis risk is the inherent risk associated with imperfect hedging and is caused by variables or characteristics that drive differences between the value of an underlying position and the hedge instruments used to offset changes in its value. Within Jackson's variable annuity business, basis risk can arise from differences between the performance of the Separate Account funds in which policyholders choose to invest and that of the instruments used to replicate these funds for hedging and liability modelling purposes, which are primarily linked to the S&P 500 index. This risk exposure is proportionate to the magnitude of liability risk/hedge position which fluctuates with equity and interest rate levels. While the market sell-off in Q1 2020 increased this liability risk/hedge exposure, the subsequent rally in equity markets over 2020 has had a corresponding opposite and positive impact. Jackson continues to actively evaluate the costs and benefits of ways to further mitigate basis risk.\n\nInterest rate risk. This is driven by the valuation of Prudential's assets (particularly the bonds that it invests in) and liabilities, which are dependent on market interest rates and expose the Group to the risk of those moving in a way that is detrimental. Some products that Prudential offers are sensitive to movements in interest rates. As part of the ongoing management of this risk, a number of mitigating actions to the in-force business have been taken, as well as repricing and restructuring new business offerings in response to recent relatively low interest rates. Nevertheless, some sensitivity to interest rate movements is still retained. The impact of lower interest rates may also manifest through reduced solvency levels in some of the Group's businesses, impairing their ability to make remittances, as/uni00A0well as reduced new business profitability.\n\nThe Group's appetite for interest rate risk is limited to where assets and liabilities can be tightly matched and where liquid assets or derivatives exist to cover interest rate exposures.\n\nIn Asia, our exposure to interest rate risk arises from the guarantees of some non-unit-linked products with a savings component, including the Hong Kong with-profits and non-profit business. This/uni00A0exposure exists because of the potential for an asset and liability mismatch, where long-dated liabilities and guarantees are backed by/uni00A0short-dated assets, which cannot be eliminated but is monitored and managed through local risk and asset liability management committees against risk appetite aligned with the Group's limit/uni00A0framework.\n\nInterest rate risk results from the cost of guarantees in the variable annuity and fixed index annuity business, which may increase when interest rates fall. The level of sales of variable annuity products with guaranteed living benefits is actively monitored, and/uni00A0the risk limits we/uni00A0have in place help to ensure we are comfortable with the level of interest rate and market risks incurred as a result. Derivatives are also used to provide some protection. Jackson is also affected by interest rate movements to its fixed annuity book where the assets are primarily invested in bonds and shareholder exposure comes from the mismatch between these assets and the guaranteed rates that are/uni00A0offered to policyholders. As at 1 June 2020, this risk has been substantially transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Athene, leaving only a limited exposure from residual policies including those from the blocks acquired externally (ie from the REALIC and John Hancock businesses).\n\nForeign exchange risk. The geographical diversity of Prudential's businesses means that it has some exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Some entities within the Group that write/uni00A0policies, invest in assets or enter into other transactions in local/uni00A0currencies or currencies not linked to the US dollar. Although this limits the effect of exchange rate movements on local operating results, it can lead to fluctuations in the Group financial statements when results are reported in US dollars. This risk is accepted within our appetite for foreign exchange risk.\n\nIn cases where a non-US dollar denominated surplus arises in an operation which is to be used to support Group capital, or where a/uni00A0significant cash payment is due from a subsidiary to the Group, this/uni00A0currency exposure may be hedged where it is believed to be economically favourable to do so. Further, the Group generally does/uni00A0not have appetite for significant direct shareholder exposure to/uni00A0foreign exchange risks in currencies outside the countries in which/uni00A0it operates, but it does have some appetite for this on fee income and on equity investments within the with-profits fund. Where foreign exchange risk arises outside appetite, currency swaps/uni00A0and other derivatives are used to manage the exposure.\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Risks to the Group's financial situation (including those from the external macroeconomic and geopolitical environment) continued\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n(Audited)\n\nPrudential's liquidity risk arises from the need to have sufficient liquid assets to meet policyholder and third-party payments as they fall due, and the Group considers this under both normal and stressed conditions. It includes the risk arising from funds composed of illiquid assets and results from a mismatch between the liquidity profile of assets and liabilities. Liquidity risk may impact on market conditions and valuation of assets in a more uncertain way than for other risks like interest rate or credit risk. It may arise, for example, where external capital is unavailable at sustainable cost, increased liquid assets are required to be held as collateral under derivative transactions or where redemption requests are made against Prudential's external funds. Liquidity risk is considered material at/uni00A0the/uni00A0level of the Group.\n\nPrudential has no appetite for any business to have insufficient resources to cover its outgoing cash flows, or for the Group as a whole to not meet cash flow requirements from its debt obligations under any plausible scenario.\n\nThe Group has significant internal sources of liquidity, which are sufficient to meet all of our expected cash requirements for at least 12/uni00A0months from the date the financial statements are approved,\n\n## Credit risk\n\n(Audited)\n\nCredit risk is the potential for a reduction in the value of investments which results from the perceived level of risk of an investment issuer being unable to meet its obligations (defaulting). Counterparty risk is a type of credit risk and relates to the risk of the counterparty to any contract we enter into being unable to meet their obligations causing the Group to suffer a loss.\n\nPrudential invests in bonds that provide a regular, fixed amount of interest income (fixed income assets) in order to match the payments needed to policyholders. It also enters into reinsurance and derivative contracts with third parties to mitigate various types of risk, as well as holding cash deposits at certain banks. As a result, it/uni00A0is/uni00A0exposed to credit risk and counterparty risk across its business. The assets backing the Jackson general account portfolio and the Asia shareholder business means credit risk is considered a material risk for the Group's business units.\n\nThe Group has some appetite to take credit risk to the extent that it/uni00A0remains part of a balanced portfolio of sources of income for shareholders and is compatible with a robust solvency position.\n\nwithout having to resort to external sources of funding. The Group has a total of $2.6 billion of undrawn committed facilities that can be made use of, expiring in 2025. Access to further liquidity is available through the debt capital markets and an extensive commercial paper programme is in place, and Prudential has maintained a consistent presence as an issuer in the market for the past decade.\n\nA number of risk management tools are used to manage and mitigate this liquidity risk, including the following:\n\n- -The Group's liquidity risk policy;\n- -Risk appetite statements, limits and triggers;\n- -Regular assessment by the Group and business units of LCRs which are calculated under both base case and stressed scenarios and are reported to committees and the Board;\n- -The Group's Liquidity Risk Management Plan, which includes details of the Group Liquidity Risk Framework as well as gap analysis of liquidity risks and the adequacy of available liquidity resources under normal and stressed conditions;\n- -Regular stress testing;\n- -Our contingency plans and identified sources of liquidity;\n- -The Group's ability to access the money and debt capital markets;\n- -Regular deep dive assessments; and\n- -The Group's access to external committed credit facilities.\n\nA number of risk management tools are used to manage and mitigate this credit risk, including the following:\n\n- -A credit risk policy and dealing and controls policy;\n- -Risk appetite statements and portfolio-level limits that have been/uni00A0defined on issuers, and counterparties;\n- -Collateral arrangements for derivative, secured lending reverse repurchase and reinsurance transactions which aim to provide a/uni00A0high level of credit protection;\n- -The Group Credit Risk Committee's oversight of credit and counterparty credit risk and sector and/or name-specific reviews;\n- -Regular assessments; and\n- -Close monitoring or restrictions on investments that may be of/uni00A0concern.\n\nThe total debt securities 4 at 31 December 2020 were $125.8 billion (31 December 2019: $134.6 billion). Credit risk arises from the debt portfolio in the Asia business comprising the shareholder, with-profit and unit-linked funds, the value of which was $89.6 billion at 31 December 2020. The majority (69 per cent) of the portfolio is in unit-linked and with-profits funds. The remaining 31 per cent of the debt portfolio is held to back the shareholder business.",

The exposure to derivative counterparty and reinsurance counterparty credit risk, which includes the recently announced reinsurance agreement with Athene Life Re, is managed using an array of risk management tools, including a comprehensive system of limits. Where appropriate, Prudential reduces its exposure, buys credit protection or uses additional collateral arrangements to manage its levels of counterparty credit risk.\n\nAt 31 December 2020:\n\n- -92 per cent of the Group's shareholder portfolio (excluding all government and government-related debt) is investment grade rated 2 . In particular, 52 per cent of the portfolio is rated 2 Aand/uni00A0above (or equivalent); and\n- -The Group's shareholder portfolio is well diversified: no individual sector 3 makes up more than 15 per cent of the total portfolio (excluding the financial and sovereign sectors).

Programmes related to regulatory/industry change such as the transition to the Hong Kong IA's GWS Framework, changes required to effect the discontinuation of inter-bank offered rates (IBORs) in their current form and the implementation of IFRS 17 are also ongoing. See below for further detail on these regulatory changes. The Group is cognisant that the speed of technological change in the business could outpace its ability to anticipate all the unintended consequences that may arise. While the adoption of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence has opened up new product opportunities and channels, it also exposes Prudential to potential information security, operational, ethical and conduct risks which, if not managed effectively, could result in customer detriment and reputational damage. The Transformation Risk Framework therefore operates alongside the Group's existing risk policies and frameworks in these areas to ensure appropriate controls and governance are in place to mitigate these risks.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nIn the course of doing business, the Group is exposed to non-financial risks. A combination of the complexity of the Group, its/uni00A0activities and the extent of transformation in progress creates a challenging operating environment. The Group's main non-financial risks are detailed below. These risks are considered to be material at/uni00A0the level of the Group.\n\nOperational risk. Prudential defines operational risk as the risk of loss (or unintended gain or profit) arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel or systems, or from external events. This may arise from employee error, model error, system failures, fraud or other events which disrupt business processes or has a detrimental impact to customers. Activities across the scope of our/uni00A0business, including operational activity, regulatory compliance, and/uni00A0those supporting ESG activities more broadly can expose us to/uni00A0operational risks. A large volume of complex transactions is processed by the Group across a number of diverse products and are subject to a high number of varying legal, regulatory and tax regimes. Prudential has no appetite for material losses (direct or indirect) suffered as a result of failing to develop, implement or monitor appropriate controls to manage operational risks.\n\nThe Group's outsourcing and third-party relationships require distinct oversight and risk management processes. A number of important third-party relationships exist which provide the distribution and processing of Prudential's products, both as market counterparties and as outsourcing partners, including new IT and technology partners. In Asia, the Group continues to expand its strategic partnerships and renew bancassurance arrangements, and in Africa Prudential is continuing its expansion through acquisitions. These third-party arrangements support Prudential in providing a high level and cost-effective service to our customers, but they also make us reliant on the operational resilience and performance of our outsourcing partners.\n\nThe Group's requirements for the management of material outsourcing arrangements, which are in accordance with relevant applicable regulations, are included through its well-established Group-wide third-party supply policy. Third-party management is/uni00A0also included and embedded in the Group-wide framework and risk management for operational risk (see below).\n\nThe performance of the Group's core business activities places reliance on the IT infrastructure, provided by our external IT and technology partners, that supports day-to-day transaction processing and administration. This IT environment must also be secure, and an increasing cyber risk threat needs to be addressed as the Group's digital footprint increases and the sophistication of cyber threats continue to evolve - see separate information security risk sub-section below. Exposure to operational and other external events could impact operational resilience by significantly disrupting systems, operations and services to customers, which may result in/uni00A0financial loss, customer impacts and reputational damage. Operational challenges also exist in keeping pace with regulatory changes. This requires implementing processes to ensure we are, and remain, compliant on an ongoing basis, including regular monitoring and reporting.",

A Group-wide operational risk framework is/uni00A0in place to identify, measure and assess, manage and control, monitor and report effectively on all material operational risks across the business. The key components of the framework are:\n\n- -Application of a risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) process, where operational risk exposures are identified and assessed as part of a periodical cycle. The RCSA process considers a range of/uni00A0internal and external factors, including an assessment of the control environment, to determine the business's most significant risk exposures on a prospective basis;\n- -An internal incident management process, which identifies, quantifies and monitors remediation conducted through root cause analysis and application of action plans for risk events that have occurred across the business;\n- -A scenario analysis process for the quantification of extreme, yet/uni00A0plausible manifestations of key operational risks across the business on a forward-looking basis. This is carried out at least annually and supports external and internal capital requirements as well as informing risk oversight activity across the business; and\n- -An operational risk appetite framework that articulates the level of/uni00A0operational risk exposure the business is willing to tolerate, covering all operational risk categories, and sets out escalation processes for breaches of appetite.\n\nOutputs from these processes and activities performed by individual business units are monitored by the Risk function, which provides an aggregated view of the risk profile across the business to the Group Risk Committee and Board.\n\nThese core framework components are embedded across the Group via the Group Operational Risk Policy and Standards documents, which set out the key principles and minimum standards for the management of operational risk across the Group. The Group Operational Risk Policy, standards and operational risk appetite framework sit alongside other risk policies and standards that individually engage with key operational risks, including outsourcing and third-party supply, business continuity, financial crime, technology and data, operations processes and extent of transformation. These policies and standards include subject matter expert-led processes that are designed to identify, assess, manage and control operational risks, including:\n\n- -A transformation risk framework that assesses, manages and reports on the end-to-end transformation life cycle, project prioritisation and the risks, interdependencies and possible conflicts arising from a large portfolio of transformation activities;\n- -Internal and external review of cyber security capability and defences;\n- -Regular updating and testing of elements of disaster-recovery plans and the Critical Incident Procedure process;\n- -Group and business unit-level compliance oversight and testing in/uni00A0respect of adherence with in-force regulations;\n- -Regulatory change teams in place to assist the business in/uni00A0proactively adapting and complying with regulatory developments;\n- -On financial crime risks (see below), screening and transaction monitoring systems are in place and a programme of compliance control monitoring reviews is undertaken, as well as regular risk assessments;\n- -A framework is in place for emerging risk identification and analysis in order to capture, monitor and allow us to prepare for/uni00A0operational risks that may crystallise beyond the short-term horizon;\n- -Corporate insurance programmes to limit the financial impact of/uni00A0operational risks; and\n- -Reviews of key operational risks and challenges within Group and/uni00A0business unit business plans.\n\nThese activities are fundamental in maintaining an effective system of internal control, and as such outputs from these also inform core RCSA, incident management and scenario analysis processes and reporting on operational risk. Furthermore, they also ensure that operational risk considerations are embedded in key business decision-making, including material business approvals and in setting and challenging the Group's strategy.\n\nBusiness disruption risk. Events in 2020 have shown how material business disruption risk is to effective business operations and delivery of business services to policyholders, and the potential impact to our customers and the market more broadly. The Group continuously seeks to develop greater business resilience through planning, preparation, testing and adaption. Business continuity management (BCM) is one of a number of activities undertaken by the Group Security function that helps the Group to protect its key stakeholders and its systems, and business resilience is at the core of/uni00A0the Group's embedded BCM programme. The BCM programme and framework are appropriately linked to all business activities, and/uni00A0includes business impact analyses, risk assessments, incident management plans, disaster recovery plans, and the exercising and execution of these plans. Based on industry standards, the BCM programme is designed to provide business continuity that matches the Group's evolving business needs and is appropriate to the size, complexity and nature of the Group's operations. Prudential is also taking a broader, multi-functional approach to building greater business resilience, working with our external third-party providers and our service delivery teams to improve our ability to withstand, absorb and recover from disruption to our business services, while minimising the impact on our customers. The Group continuously reviews and develops its contingency plans and its ability to respond effectively when disruptive incidents occur, such as those resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and, prior to this, the Hong Kong protests in 2019. Business disruption risks are closely monitored by/uni00A0the Group Security function, with key operational effectiveness metrics and updates on specific activities being reported to the Group Risk Committee and discussed by cross-functional working/uni00A0groups.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Risks from the nature of our business and our industry continued\n\n## Non-financial risks continued\n\nInformation security risk and data privacy. Information security and data privacy risks remain significant considerations for Prudential. This includes the risk of malicious attack on its systems, network disruption and risks relating to data security, integrity, privacy and misuse. The cyber security threat and criminal capability in this area continues to evolve globally in sophistication and potential significance with an increased level of understanding of/uni00A0complex financial transactions which increases the risks to the financial services industry. The systemic risk of sophisticated but untargeted attacks remains elevated, particularly during times of heightened geopolitical tensions and during the current disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The scale of the Group's IT infrastructure and network (and the services required to monitor and manage it), stakeholder expectations and high-profile cyber security and data misuse incidents across industries mean that these risks are considered material at the level of the Group.\n\nPrudential and the insurance industry are making increasing use of/uni00A0emerging technological tools and digital services, or forming partnerships with third parties that provide these capabilities. While this provides new opportunities, opening up markets, improving insights and increasing scalability, it also comes with additional risks which are managed within the Group's existing governance and risk management processes, including additional operational risks and increased risks around data security and misuse. Automated digital distribution channels increase the criticality of system and process resilience in order to deliver uninterrupted service to customers.\n\nDevelopments in data protection requirements, such as the California Consumer Protection Act which came into force on 1 January 2020, continue to evolve worldwide. This increases financial and reputational implications for Prudential in the event of/uni00A0a/uni00A0breach of its (or third-party suppliers') IT systems. As well as protecting data, stakeholders expect companies and organisations to/uni00A0use personal information transparently and appropriately. New/uni00A0and currently unforeseeable regulatory issues may also arise from the increased use of emerging technology, data and digital services. This/uni00A0includes the international transfer of data which, as a global organisation, increases regulatory risks for Prudential. Given this, both information security and data privacy are key risks for the Group. As well as having preventative risk management in place, it is fundamental that the Group has robust critical recovery systems in place in the event of a successful attack on its infrastructure, a breach of its information security or a failure of its systems in order to retain its customer relationships and trusted reputation.\n\nDuring 2020, work to operationalise the revised organisational structure and governance model for cyber security management has/uni00A0continued. This change has resulted in a centralised Group-wide Information Security and Privacy function, leveraging skills, tools and resources across the business under a 'centre of excellence' model. This global function is led by the Group Chief Information Security Officer and falls within the scope of the responsibilities of the Group Chief Digital Officer, working closely with the Group Risk and Compliance Function and Group CRCO to ensure appropriate second line oversight. Cyber risk management is also conducted locally within business units with input from business information security officers and with oversight from local risk committees. The/uni00A0Prudential plc Board is briefed at least twice annually on cyber security by the Group CISO and executive training is provided to ensure that members understand the latest regulatory expectations and the threats facing the Group and that they have the means to enable appropriate oversight in this area.\n\nAn updated Group-wide information security policy has been introduced that aligns to over 20 international standards such as ISO/uni00A027001/2, MAS, and NIST Cyber Security Framework to ensure full coverage and adoption of best practices. Local policies are also aligned to relevant local regulation or law. Our Group-wide privacy policy was developed in collaboration with industry experts to support a pragmatic approach to the evolving regulatory environment globally and ensure compliance with all applicable laws/uni00A0and regulations. This approach ensures that all our stakeholders have confidence in our approach to information security and risk/uni00A0management.\n\nThese developments have allowed the Group to progress on its cyber security strategy, which for 2020 has four key objectives:\n\n- -Automation of key processes to provide near real-time information on cyber security risks, allowing for increased response times scalability of defences to threat vectors across all security disciplines. This also enables improved, and more rapid, decision-making;\n- -Using technology for the rapid enablement of the Group's businesses, which supports the Group Digital Transformation strategy while meeting the security requirements and expectations;\n- -Optimisations for efficiency in cyber security and data privacy management. This includes the delivery of centralised services across the Group in areas such as vulnerability management; and -Continuous identification and implementation of improvements to the people, processes or technology deployed on cyber security and privacy management.",

There is a risk of adverse consequences arising from erroneous or misinterpreted tools used in core business activities, decision making and reporting. The Group utilises various tools to perform a range of operational functions including the calculation of regulatory or internal capital requirements, the valuation of assets and liabilities, determining hedging requirements, and in acquiring new business using artificial intelligence and digital applications. Many of these tools are an integral part of the information and decision-making framework of Prudential and errors or limitations in these tools, or inappropriate usage, may lead to regulatory breaches, inappropriate decision-making, financial loss, or/uni00A0reputational damage.\n\nThe Group has no appetite for model, UDA and RPA risk arising as/uni00A0a/uni00A0result of failing to develop, implement and monitor appropriate risk mitigation measures.\n\nPrudential's model, UDA and RPA risk is managed and mitigated using the following:\n\n- -The Group's Model, UDA and RPA Risk Policy and relevant Guidelines;\n- -Annual risk assessment of all tools used for core business activities, decision making and reporting;\n- -Maintenance of appropriate documentation for tools used;\n- -Implementation of controls to ensure tools are accurate and appropriately used;\n- -Tools are subject to rigorous and independent model validation; and\n- -Regular reporting to the Risk-function to support the measurement and management of the risk.\n\n## Insurance risks\n\n(Audited)\n\nInsurance risk makes up a significant proportion of Prudential's overall risk exposure. The profitability of its businesses depends on/uni00A0a/uni00A0mix of factors, including levels of, and trends in, mortality (policyholders dying), morbidity (policyholders becoming ill) and/uni00A0policyholder behaviour (variability in how customers interact with their policies, including utilisation of withdrawals, take-up of/uni00A0options and guarantees and persistency, ie lapsing of policies), and/uni00A0increases in the costs of claims, including the level of medical expenses increases over and above price inflation (claim inflation).\n\nThe principal drivers of the Group's insurance risk vary across its business units. Across Asia, where a significant volume of health and protection business is written, the most significant insurance risks are persistency risk, morbidity risk and medical inflation risk. In Jackson, policyholder behaviour risk is particularly material, especially in the take up of options and guarantees on variable annuity business which impacts profitability and is influenced by market performance and the value of policy guarantees.\n\nThe Group has appetite for retaining insurance risks in the areas where it believes it has expertise and operational controls to manage\n\nFinancial crime risk. As with all financial services firms, Prudential is/uni00A0exposed to risks relating to money laundering (the risk that the products or services of the Group are used by customers or other third parties to transfer or conceal the proceeds of crime); fraud (the/uni00A0risk that fraudulent claims or transactions, or procurement of/uni00A0services, are made against or through the business); sanctions compliance (the risk that the Group undertakes business with individuals and entities on the lists of the main sanctions regimes); and bribery and corruption (the risk that employees or associated persons seek to influence the behaviour of others to obtain an unfair advantage or receive benefits from others for the same purpose).\n\nPrudential operates in some high-risk countries where, for example, the acceptance of cash premiums from customers may be common practice, large-scale agency networks may be in operation where sales are incentivised by commission and fees, where there is a higher concentration of exposure to politically-exposed persons, or/uni00A0which otherwise have higher geopolitical risk exposure.\n\nThe Group-wide policies we have in place on anti-money laundering, fraud, sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption reflect the values, behaviours and standards that are expected across the business. Screening and transaction monitoring systems are in/uni00A0place and a/uni00A0series of improvements and upgrades are being implemented, while/uni00A0a programme of compliance control monitoring reviews is/uni00A0being undertaken. Risk assessments are performed annually at/uni00A0higher risk locations. Due diligence reviews and assessments against Prudential's financial crime policies are performed as part of/uni00A0the Group's business acquisition process. The/uni00A0Group continues to/uni00A0undertake strategic activity to monitor and evaluate the evolving fraud risk landscape, mitigate the likelihood of/uni00A0fraud occurring and/uni00A0increase the rate of detection.\n\nThe Group has in place a mature confidential reporting system through which staff and other stakeholders can report concerns relating to potential misconduct. The process and results of this are/uni00A0overseen by the Group Audit Committee.\n\nthe risk and where it judges it to be more value-creating to do so rather than transferring the risk, and only to the extent that these risks remains part of a balanced portfolio of sources of income for shareholders and is compatible with a robust solvency position.\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 to economic activity and employment levels across the Group's markets has the potential to elevate the incidence of claims, lapses, or surrenders of policies, and some policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums or reduce deposits into retirement plans. In particular extended restrictions on/uni00A0movement could affect product persistency in the Group's Asia business. The pandemic may also result in elevated claims and policy lapses or surrenders in a less direct way, and with some delay in time before being felt by the Group, due to factors such as policyholders deferring medical treatment during the pandemic, or policyholders lapsing or surrendering their policies on the expiry of grace periods for premium payments provided by the Group's businesses. While these impacts to the business have not been material to date, they are/uni00A0being closely monitored by the Group's businesses with targeted management actions being implemented where necessary, which/uni00A0includes additional Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims reserves in some markets where deferrals in non-acute medical treatments due to movement restrictions have been observed.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Any expected change in future persistency is/uni00A0also reflected in the assumptions. Persistency risk is managed by appropriate training and sales processes (including active customer engagement and service quality) and managed locally post-sale through regular experience monitoring and the identification of common characteristics of business with high lapse rates. Where appropriate, allowance is made for the relationship (either assumed or observed historically) between persistency and investment returns and any additional risk is accounted for. Modelling this dynamic policyholder behaviour is particularly important when assessing the/uni00A0likely take-up rate of options embedded within certain products. The effect of persistency on the Group's financial results can vary but/uni00A0depends mostly on product design and market conditions.\n\nIn Asia, Prudential writes significant volumes of health and protection business and so a key assumption is the rate of medical inflation, which is often in excess of general price inflation. There is a risk that the expenses of medical treatment increase more than expected, so/uni00A0the medical claim cost passed on to Prudential is higher than anticipated. Medical expense inflation risk is best mitigated by\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nPrudential's conduct of business, especially the design and distribution of its products, is crucial in ensuring that the Group's commitment to meeting customers' needs and expectations are met. The Group's conduct risk framework, owned by the Group Chief Executive, was further developed in 2020 and reflects management's focus on customer outcomes.\n\nFactors that may increase conduct risks can be found throughout the/uni00A0product life cycle, from the complexity of the Group's products, to its diverse distribution channels, including virtual face-to-face sales and sales via online digital platforms. In alignment with the Group's purpose of helping people get the most out of life, Prudential strives towards making health and protection coverage affordable and accessible to all. Through the Pulse by Prudential app, there is/uni00A0increased focused on making insurance more inclusive to underserved segments of society, through bite-size low cost digital products and services. Through this transition, Prudential must continue to ensure the quality of its ongoing servicing of all its customers.

Prudential's morbidity risk is mitigated by appropriate underwriting when policies are issued and claims are received. Our/uni00A0morbidity assumptions reflect our recent experience and expectation of future trends for each relevant line of business.\n\nPrudential's insurance risks are managed and mitigated using the/uni00A0following:\n\n- -The Group's insurance, product and underwriting risk policies;\n- -The risk appetite statements, limits and triggers;\n- -Using persistency, morbidity and longevity assumptions that reflect recent experience and expectation of future trends, and/uni00A0industry data and expert judgement where appropriate;\n- -Using reinsurance to mitigate mortality and morbidity risks;\n- -Ensuring appropriate medical underwriting when policies are issued and appropriate claims management practices when claims/uni00A0are received in order to mitigate morbidity risk;\n- -Maintaining the quality of sales processes, training and using initiatives to increase customer retention in order to mitigate persistency risk;\n\n-Using product repricing and other claims management initiatives\n\nin order to mitigate medical expense inflation risk; and\n\n- -Regular deep dive assessments.\n\nManagement of Prudential's conduct risk is key to the Group's strategy. Prudential's conduct risks are managed and mitigated using the following:\n\n- -The Group's code of business conduct and conduct standards, product and underwriting risk policies and other related policies;\n- -Ensuring the quality of sales and marketing material via robust review and sign off procedures;\n- -Ensuring sales practices meet commitments to customers and regulators via the use of well-designed monitoring programmes relevant to the type of business (insurance or asset management), distribution channel (agency, bancassurance, or digital) and ecosystem;\n- -Ensuring sales processes are designed to meet commitments to customers and regulators and that they are operating effectively via robust assurance programmes both pre and post implementation;\n- -Maintaining the quality of sales processes and training, and using other initiatives such as special requirements for vulnerable customers, to improve customer outcomes;\n- -Proper claims management and complaint handling practices;\n- -Regular deep dive assessments on, and monitoring of, conduct risks; and\n- -Conduct Risk Assessments.",

This covers a broad range of risks including changes in government policy and legislation, capital control measures, and new regulations at either national or international level. In addition to the risks arising from regulatory change, the breadth of local and Group-wide regulatory arrangements presents the risk that regulatory requirements are not/uni00A0fully met, resulting in specific regulator interventions or actions including retrospective interpretation of standards by regulators which may result in regulatory censure or significant additional costs to the business. Furthermore, as the industry's use of emerging technological tools and digital services increases, this is likely to lead to new and unforeseen regulatory issues and the Group is monitoring the regulatory developments and standards emerging around the governance and ethical use of technology and data.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions in which Prudential operates there are also a/uni00A0number of ongoing policy initiatives and regulatory developments that are having, and will continue to have, an impact on the way Prudential is supervised. Decisions taken by regulators, including those related to solvency requirements, corporate or governance structures, capital allocation, financial reporting and risk management may have an impact on our business.\n\nThe focus of some governments toward more protectionist or restrictive economic and trade policies could impact on the degree and nature of regulatory changes and Prudential's competitive position in some geographic markets. This could take effect, for example, through increased friction in cross-border trade, capital controls or measures favouring local enterprises such as changes to/uni00A0the maximum level of non-domestic ownership by foreign companies. These developments continue to be monitored by the Group at a national and global level and these considerations form part of the Group's ongoing engagement with government policy teams and regulators.\n\nFurther information on specific areas of regulatory and supervisory requirements and changes are included below.\n\nGroup-wide supervision. From 21 October 2019, Prudential's Group-wide supervisor changed to the Hong Kong IA. As a result, the Group currently applies the local capital summation method (LCSM) to determine Group regulatory capital requirements (both minimum and prescribed levels). The primary legislation was enacted in July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The/uni00A0relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will also come into operation on 29 March 2021. This will be/uni00A0supported by further guidance material to be released by the Hong Kong IA. Prior to the GWS Framework becoming effective for the Group, which is expected in the second quarter of 2021 upon designation by the Hong Kong IA, Prudential remains subject to the Regulatory Letter signed with the Hong Kong IA. The letter outlines the interim supervision arrangements from October 2019 when it became the group-wide supervisor of the Group.\n\n## Global regulatory developments and systemic risk regulation.\n\nEfforts to curb systemic risk and promote financial stability are also/uni00A0under way. At the international level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) continues to develop recommendations for the asset management and insurance sectors, including ongoing assessment of systemic risk measures. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has continued its focus on the following key/uni00A0developments.\n\nIn November 2019 the IAIS adopted the Common Framework (ComFrame) which establishes supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the effective group-wide supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). Prudential was included in the first/uni00A0register of IAIGs released by the IAIS on 1 July 2020 and was designated an IAIG by the Hong Kong IA following an assessment against the established criteria in ComFrame.\n\nThe IAIS has also been developing the ICS (Insurance Capital Standard) as part of ComFrame. The implementation of ICS will be/uni00A0conducted in two phases: a five-year monitoring phase followed by an implementation phase. The Aggregation Method is one of the alternatives being considered to the default approach undertaken for the ICS during the monitoring period and the related proposals are being led by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Alongside the current ICS developments, the NAIC is also developing its Group Capital Calculation (GCC) for the supervision of insurance groups in the US. The GCC is intended to be a risk-based capital (RBC) aggregation methodology. In developing the GCC, the/uni00A0NAIC will also consider Group capital developments by the US/uni00A0Federal Reserve Board, which will inform the US regulatory association in its construction of a US group capital calculation.\n\nIn November 2019 the FSB endorsed a new Holistic Framework (HF), intended for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector, for implementation by the IAIS in 2020 and has suspended G-SII designations until completion of a review to be undertaken in 2022. Many of the previous G-SII measures have already been adopted into the Insurance Core Principles (ICPs) and/uni00A0ComFrame. As an IAIG, Prudential is expected to be subject to these measures. The HF also includes a monitoring element for the identification of a build-up of systemic risk and to enable supervisors to take action where appropriate. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, this monitoring requirement was replaced with a Covid-19-focused exercise for 2020, with annual monitoring expected to recommence in 2021. In November 2020 the IAIS launched a public consultation on phase 1 of a proposed liquidity metric to be used as an ancillary indicator in the monitoring of the build-up of systemic risk. This followed a more general consultation on liquidity metrics earlier in 2020. Consultations on a phase 2 liquidity metric, as well as on macroeconomic elements of the HF, are/uni00A0expected to follow. The FSB published its 2020 Resolution Report in November 2020, highlighting intra-group connectedness and funding in resolution as key areas of attention for its work on resolution planning. Resolution regimes will continue to be a near-term focus in the FSB's financial stability work, potentially being/uni00A0a key/uni00A0tool in informing decisions around the reformed G-SII designation in 2022.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Jackson has introduced fee-based variable annuity products in response to the/uni00A0potential introduction of such rules, and we anticipate that the business's strong relationships with distributors, history of product innovation and efficient operations should further mitigate any/uni00A0impacts.\n\nIn Asia, regulatory regimes are developing at different speeds, driven/uni00A0by a combination of global factors and local considerations. New local capital rules and requirements could be introduced in these and/uni00A0other regulatory regimes that challenge legal or ownership structures, or current sales practices, or could be applied to sales made prior to their introduction retrospectively, which have a negative impact on Prudential's business and reported results.\n\nIFRS 17. In May 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published its replacement standard on insurance accounting IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts'. Some targeted amendments to this standard, including to the effective date, were issued in June 2020. IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts', as amended, will introduce fundamental changes to the IFRS-based reporting of insurance entities that prepare accounts according to IFRS from 2023. IFRS 17 is/uni00A0expected to, among other things, include altering the timing of IFRS/uni00A0profit recognition, and the implementation of the standard is/uni00A0likely to require changes to the Group's IT, actuarial and finance systems. The Group is reviewing the complex requirements of this standard and considering its potential impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Group's ESG-related risks\n\nThese include environmental risks associated with climate change (including physical and transition risks), social risks arising from/uni00A0diverse stakeholder commitments and expectations and governance-related risks.\n\nThe purpose of a business and the way in which it operates in achieving its objectives, including in relation to ESG-related matters, are an increasingly material consideration for key stakeholders in/uni00A0achieving their own objectives and aims. ESG-related risks may/uni00A0directly or/uni00A0indirectly impact Prudential's business and the achievement of its strategy and consequently those of its key stakeholders, which range from customers, institutional investors, employees and suppliers, to policymakers, regulators, industry organisations and local communities, all of whom have expectations, concerns and aims which may differ. Material risks associated with key ESG themes may adversely impact the reputation and brand of/uni00A0the Group, its ability to/uni00A0attract and retain customers and staff, its/uni00A0ability to deliver on its long-term strategy and therefore the results of its operations and long-term financial success.\n\nThe Prudential ESG Strategic Framework, developed in 2020, focuses on giving people greater access to good health and financial security, responsible stewardship in managing the human impact of climate change and building human and social capital with its broad\n\nrange of stakeholders. Prudential seeks to ESG-related risks to its/uni00A0strategy and their negative implications to stakeholder through a/uni00A0transparent and consistent implementation of this strategy in its key/uni00A0markets and across operational, underwriting and investment activities. The strategy is enabled by strong internal governance, sound business practices and a responsible investment approach, both as an asset owner and asset manager.\n\n## (a)  Environmental risks\n\nPrudential's strategic ESG focus on stewarding the human impacts of/uni00A0climate change recognises that environmental concerns, notably those associated with climate change, may pose significant risks to/uni00A0Prudential, its customers and other stakeholders. Prudential's investment horizons are long term and it is therefore exposed to the potential long-term impact of climate change risks, which include the financial and non-financial impact of transition, physical and litigation risks. A failure to understand, manage and provide greater transparency of its exposure to these climate-related risks may have increasing adverse implications for Prudential and its stakeholders.\n\nInter-bank offered rate reforms. In July 2014, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) announced widespread reforms to address the integrity and reliability of IBORs. The discontinuation of IBORs in their current form and their replacement with alternative risk-free reference rates such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) benchmark in/uni00A0the UK and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the US could, among other things, impact the Group through an adverse effect on the value of Prudential's assets and liabilities which are linked to, or which reference IBORs, a reduction in market liquidity during any period of transition and increased legal and conduct risks to the Group arising from changes required to documentation and its/uni00A0related obligations to its stakeholders.\n\nRisk management and mitigation of regulatory risk at Prudential includes the following:\n\n- -Risk assessment of the Business Plan which includes consideration of current strategies;\n- -Close monitoring and assessment of our business environment and strategic risks;\n- -The consideration of risk themes in strategic decisions;\n- -Ongoing engagement with national regulators, government policy teams and international standard setters; and\n- -Compliance oversight to ensure adherence with in-force regulations and management of new regulatory developments.",

The speed of this transition, and the extent to which it is orderly and managed, will be influenced by factors such as public policy, technology and changes in market or investor sentiment. This climate-related transition risk may adversely impact the valuation of investments held by the Group, and the potential broader economic impact may affect customer demand for/uni00A0the Group's products. Prudential's stakeholders increasingly expect and/or rely on the Group to support an orderly transition based on an understanding of relevant country and company-level plans and which takes into consideration the impact on the economies, businesses and customers in the markets in which it operates and invests. Understanding and appropriately reacting to/uni00A0transition risk requires sufficient and reliable data on carbon exposure and transition plans for the assets in which the Group invests. The direct physical impacts of climate change, driven by both specific short-term climate-related events such as natural disasters and longer-term changes to climate and the natural environment, will/uni00A0increasingly influence the longevity, mortality and morbidity risk assessments for the Group's life insurance product underwriting and offerings and their associated claims profiles. Climate-driven events in countries in/uni00A0which Prudential or its key third parties operate could impact the Group's operational resilience and its customers. More information about the activities the Group is undertaking to increase its understanding and risk management of these climate-related risks/uni00A0can be found in the Prudential plc ESG Report 2020, see pages/uni00A087 to 92.\n\n## (b)  Social risks\n\nSocial risks that could impact Prudential may arise from a failure to/uni00A0consider the rights, diversity, wellbeing, and interests of people and communities in which the Group or its third parties operate. These risks are increased as Prudential operates in multiple jurisdictions with distinct local cultures and considerations. As an employer, the/uni00A0Group aims to attract, retain and develop highly-skilled staff, which relies on having in place responsible working practices and recognising the benefits of diversity and promoting a culture of/uni00A0inclusion. The Group's reputation extends to its supply chains, which may be exposed to factors such as poor labour standards and abuses of human rights by third parties. Emerging population risks associated with public health trends (such as an increase in obesity) and demographic changes (such as population urbanisation and ageing) may affect customer lifestyles and therefore may impact claims against the Group's insurance product offerings.

Anything that cannot be identified from the three sources noted is classified as other.\n- 4 From half year 2020, to align more closely with the internal risk management analysis, the Group altered the compilation of its credit ratings analysis to use the middle of the Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch ratings, where available. Where ratings are not available from these rating agencies, NAIC ratings (for the US), local external rating agencies' ratings and lastly internal ratings have been used. Securities with none of the ratings listed above are classified as unrated and included under the 'below BBB- and unrated' category. The total securities (excluding sovereign debt) that were unrated at 31 December 2020 were $780 million (31 December 2019: $648 million). Previously, Standard & Poor's ratings were used where available and if not, Moody's and then Fitch were used as alternatives.\n- 5 Excluding assets in consolidated funds financed largely by external third-party (non-recourse) borrowings, for which the Group's exposure is limited to the investment held by/uni00A0Jackson.

As a result, Prudential has access to customer personal data, including data related to personal health, and an increasing ability to analyse and interpret this data through the use/uni00A0of/uni00A0complex tools, machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. The Group therefore actively manages the regulatory, ethical and reputational risks associated with actual or perceived customer data misuse or security breaches. These risks are explained above. The increasing digitalisation of products, services and processes may also result in new and unforeseen regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations which Prudential monitors for, as well as ensuring support for its customers through this transformation.\n\n## (c)  Governance risks\n\nMaintaining high standards of corporate governance is crucial for the/uni00A0Group and its customers, staff and employees, reducing the risk/uni00A0of poor decision-making and a lack of oversight of its key risks. Poor governance may arise where key governance committees have insufficient independence, a lack of diversity, skills or experience in their members, or unclear (or insufficient) oversight responsibilities and mandates. Inadequate oversight over remuneration increases the risk of poor senior management behaviours. Prudential operates across multiple jurisdictions and has a group and subsidiary governance structure which may add further complexity to these considerations. Participation in joint ventures or partnerships where Prudential does not have direct overall control and the use of third-party suppliers increases the potential for reputational risks arising from poor governance.\n\nRisk management and mitigation of ESG risks at Prudential include the following:\n\n- -The Group's ESG Strategic Framework focused on strategic differentiators and enablers;\n- -The Group Code of Business Conduct and Group Governance Manual including ESG linked policies;\n- -ESG risk identification including through emerging risk processes;\n- -Deep dives into ESG themes including climate-related risks; and\n- -Integrating ESG considerations into investment processes\n\nFurther information on the Group's ESG governance is included in/uni00A0section 4 above, and further detail on the Group's ESG Strategic Framework and the management of material risks associated with ESG themes are included in the ESG Report 2020, see pages 70 t o /uni00A0 1 1 7.\n\no\n\nn",

As such, Prudential considers that its purpose aligns closely with important societal needs, including making health and financial security more accessible, improving financial inclusion and education and transitioning to a low carbon economy. Prudential is focused on addressing these increasing needs, reflecting population demographics in our chosen markets. The/uni00A0drivers for this structural growth, such as the low penetration rates across the Asian region, are discussed on pages 19 to 25 alongside the activities we undertook during 2020 to expand our Asian and African footprint and enhance our capabilities, particularly through increased digitalisation. To enable the Group to focus exclusively on its highgrowth Asia and Africa businesses, the Group intends to pursue the demerger of its US business allowing Jackson to focus on the distinct opportunities within the US retirement market. Further information on/uni00A0the progress of this demerger is set out on pages 06 to 07. In/uni00A0undertaking these activities, we aim to both meet the evolving needs of our customers and provide sustainable growth for our shareholders, which will ultimately lead to the viability of our business over the longer term.\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy and the related restrictions have applied to the Group's individual markets to varying degrees and at different periods. Our focus during this time has been on supporting our communities, customers and staff through the challenges created. The business has seen a short-term impact on/uni00A0sales but we believe the Covid-19 disruptions have also acted to intensify the structural opportunities in Asia and Africa over the longer term with a clear and increasing need for the broad-based products we/uni00A0deliver. During the pandemic, the Group has continued to innovate, as demonstrated by the continued rollout of Pulse by Prudential, to ensure we can capture these opportunities post Covid-19. The long-term macro-economic impacts of the pandemic remain uncertain but all of the Group's activities are underpinned by/uni00A0ongoing risk management, implemented via the Group Risk Framework and risk appetite limits described on pages 51 to 54.\n\nThe Group as a whole and each of its life assurance operations are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, which are designed primarily to reinforce the Group's management of its long-term solvency, liquidity and viability to ensure that it can continue to meet obligations to policyholders. Further details on the current capital strength of the Group are provided on pages 31 to 32.\n\nThe Group's management of wider environmental, social and governance issues that could pose a risk in the future to the Group is/uni00A0set out in the Environmental, Social and Governance report on pages/uni00A070 to 117.\n\nThis risk and regulatory focus supports the sustainability of our business over the longer term.\n\n## Period of viability assessment\n\nThe Directors have assessed the viability of the Group for a period longer than the 12 months required by the going concern statement.\n\nThe Directors performed the assessment by reference to the threeyear plan period to 31 December 2023. Three years is considered an appropriate period as it represents the period covered by the detailed business plan that is prepared annually on a rolling three-year basis. In/uni00A0approving the business plan, the Directors reviewed the Group's projected performance with regards to profitability, cash generation and capital position, together with the parent company's liquidity over/uni00A0this three-year period. This projection involves setting a number of economic and other assumptions that are inherently volatile over a/uni00A0much longer reporting period. Such assumptions include foreign exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth rates, the impact on/uni00A0the business environment arising from the impact of Covid-19, geopolitical events and continued level of changes in regulation and supervision. The Directors are satisfied that this period is sufficient to/uni00A0enable a reasonable assessment of viability to be made.\n\nThe intended demerger of Jackson from the Group is expected to/uni00A0occur within the period covered by the viability statement. The/uni00A0Directors have therefore considered the ability of the Group to continue in its current form (ie the scenario in which the demerger does not proceed) for the three-year period ending 31 December 2023 as well as the viability of the Group in the more likely scenario that the demerger proceeds.\n\n## Assessment of principal risks over the period\n\nThe Group's business plan implements the Group's strategic objectives through the business model and activities discussed on pages 14 to 15. Matters considered as part of that planning process included the effect of current Covid-19 restrictions on people movement and face-to-face business activity and the continued rollout of Pulse by Prudential. Assessment of the risks to achieving the projected performance remains an integral part of the planning process. The Group's approach to risk management and a summary of the key risks facing the Group are set out on pages 45 to 69.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing the Group's viability, the Directors considered those risks where the impact of possible adverse external developments could be of such speed and severity to present a shock to the Group's financial position. The risks considered, from those detailed on pages 55 to 67 are: market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and/uni00A0regulatory risk. The Directors considered the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical risks in the markets which the Group/uni00A0operates.",

        "page_content": "## Stress and scenario testing\n\nAs noted above, underpinning the projections in the business plan are a number of economic and other assumptions. To evaluate the Group's resilience to significant deteriorations in market and credit conditions and other shock events, these risks are grouped together into scenarios which are then applied to the assumptions underlying the business plans considered. Scenarios considered include those reflecting the possible impacts of Covid-19 on new business, including the uncertainty as to the duration of restrictions in individual markets and the length of time for sales to recover to previous levels and different timings of expected regulatory changes. Separately stresses have been applied to the economic and non-economic assumptions underlying the base case business plan. These stresses assess the potential impact of up or down interest rate movements combined with corporate credit spread widening, a rating level downgrade on part of the credit asset portfolio, falling equity values and insurance stresses (such as changes in policyholder behaviour, including lapses, and increased morbidity in Asia). In addition, the adequacy of liquid resources of the Group's parent company across the plan period has been assessed by considering a stress scenario assuming the closure of short-term debt markets, as well as additional calls on central liquidity by the business units. In this liquidity stress scenario, the Group would have access to sufficient resources to meet the funding requirements of the business, after taking into account the Group's undrawn committed liquidity facilities of $2.6 billion, on top of/uni00A0central cash and short-term investment balances, which as at 31 December 2020 were $1.5 billion.\n\nThe scenarios tested showed that the Group would be able to maintain viability over the three-year period under assessment, after taking account of the actions available to management to mitigate the impacts on capital and liquidity in such scenarios. In addition, the Group conducts an annual reverse stress test which gives the Directors an understanding of the maximum resilience of the Group to extremely severe adverse scenarios. The projections in the business plan, and in/uni00A0the scenarios considered, do not assume that the Group accesses or/uni00A0relies upon the proceeds from any potential equity raise in the three-year period under assessment. This analysis assists in identifying management actions that could be implemented to restore the Group's/uni00A0capital and liquidity resources from extreme positions. This/uni00A0analysis also informs the Group's recovery plan and liquidity risk/uni00A0management plan.\n\nThe impact on the business of known areas of regulatory change whose financial implications can be reasonably quantified is also considered as part of the plan, for example the introduction of the Hong Kong Insurance Authority's Group-wide Supervision regime and the implementation of RBC regimes in Hong Kong and other markets. As/uni00A0well as known areas of regulatory change, the Group is exposed to the risk of sudden and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements at the Group and local levels. While unexpected changes cannot be fully anticipated and hence modelled, the risk of regulatory change is/uni00A0mitigated by capital held by the Group and its subsidiaries in excess of Group and local regulatory requirements, the Group and its subsidiaries' ability to generate significant capital annually through operational delivery and the availability of compensating actions designed to restore key capital metrics.\n\n## Conclusion on viability\n\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation/uni00A0that the Group will be able to continue in operation and/uni00A0meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year plan period to/uni00A0December 2023.\n\no\n\nn",

This review was informed by work done in parallel to refresh the Company's purpose which is to help people get the most out of life. We deliver on that purpose by making healthcare affordable and accessible, helping people accumulate wealth through growing their assets, and empowering our customers to save for their goals. In this way, we ensure alignment of our creation of shareholder returns with our creation of societal value given the nature of our business and the markets in which we operate.\n\nOur new ESG strategy distils the many ways in which we help our stakeholders into three core themes, all of which are closely linked to/uni00A0our strategy and business model:\n\nMaking health and financial security accessible: Working at scale, we give people greater access to good health and financial security. Covid-19, the rise in non-communicable conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, and ageing populations threaten to widen further the existing health, protection and savings gaps. Behind these megatrends lie countless individual stories of people who are anxious and struggling because of a lack of access to health and finance. We/uni00A0are committed to enabling as many individuals as possible in the/uni00A0markets in which we operate to make the most of their lives. In/uni00A0particular, we are increasing our focus on underserved communities and moving beyond our traditional role of financial protection to provide services that also/uni00A0prevent and postpone ill-health. Pulse, our health and wealth super-app now in live in 15 markets, is a key tool for us in meeting that/uni00A0ambition. Essential, too, are the tireless efforts of our colleagues, agents and other partners in developing product offerings that meet the needs of our diverse customer base. Our community investment programmes, focusing on education and financial literacy, also have an important role to play in building understanding of the benefits of financial products, and in building financial capabilities to/uni00A0ensure people can make informed financial decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stewarding the human impacts of climate change: We are a\n\nresponsible steward in managing the human impact of climate change. We are a signatory to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and as a significant asset manager and asset owner in regions forecast to be severely impacted by global warming, Prudential has a distinctive role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are decarbonising our investment portfolio and actively engaging with policymakers and/uni00A0investee businesses to encourage sustainable development. The economies of East Asia, where our businesses are concentrated, have a greater reliance on manufacturing and primary industries than/uni00A0more developed markets, where services account for a higher proportion of GDP. This means that the energy transition across the region is starting from a higher carbon intensity level and is likely to/uni00A0proceed at a slower pace than for more advanced economies. Recognising this, as we support the move to a lower-carbon economy in these emerging markets, we strive to ensure that the transition is an inclusive one for all of society - one that supports sustainable growth and economic health within our local markets and communities. We/uni00A0also recognise the importance of reducing the direct impact of our/uni00A0own operations on the environment and we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This/uni00A0year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and/uni00A0Scope/uni00A02 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. We are in/uni00A0the process of assessing similar suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments. We also seek to apply ESG considerations more broadly in our investment process and our fiduciary and stewardship duties, to ensure that our investment decisions are aligned with our values and support our primary focus on/uni00A0healthy lives.\n\nBuilding social capital: We are committed to building both our own human capital and our social capital with our broader stakeholders. We seek to empower people and unlock their potential. We do this by/uni00A0promoting diversity in representation and thought, and fostering a/uni00A0culture of inclusion and a sense of belonging within our organisation. Just as Prudential depends on the trust of our people, it also needs the/uni00A0trust of the external world. As we develop our digital capabilities, we need also to prioritise digital responsibility throughout our organisation. We must always keep in mind that our purpose to help people get the most out of life is the reason why we are investing purposefully in artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies, and that focus on the needs and interests of our users has to guide us in/uni00A0how we interact with them and handle their personal data as our capabilities develop.\n\nThis report covers the Group's ESG strategy and activities. It also presents the non-financial information statement and Section 172 Statement required by the UK Companies Act.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Development of the ESG Strategic Framework\n\nIn line with good practice, the framework was developed following a/uni00A0rigorous analysis process, which identified key ESG stakeholder expectations from investors, rating agencies, government and regulators, stock exchanges, NGOs, industry and independent organisations, media and employees. This approach was taken to ensure that the framework ascertained the most material issues, considered as broad a spectrum of stakeholders as possible, and was tested robustly from their perspectives. The process also considered upcoming regulation to shape a view of expectations, emerging policy and peer themes to direction of travel, noting that this is a rapidly evolving area. This comprehensive internal and external stakeholder engagement informed the materiality assessment for the purposes of our 2020 ESG reporting. The Section 172 Statement below provides information on stakeholder engagement throughout the year, which was considered within the development of the ESG Strategic Framework where relevant.\n\nThrough this analysis, the three strategic pillars, plus the differentiators and enablers, were identified and defined at a high level. These proposals were discussed with a number of stakeholders across the Group in order to ensure our ESG strategy was fully integrated into the/uni00A0business, and to test and validate the proposed framework. This stakeholder group included those responsible for ESG and responsible investment-related activities within the business units, along with function leads (eg HR, Digital, Risk), business unit CEOs, the Group Executive Committee, and Board members.\n\nThe Strategic Framework was formally reviewed by the Group ESG/uni00A0Committee and then considered by the Group Nomination & Governance Committee, which recommended it to the Group Board, which formally approved it in December 2020.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nESG is overseen by the Board, which is responsible for determining strategy and prioritisation of key focus areas. In order to provide greater senior executive involvement and holistic oversight of ESG matters material to the Group, in 2020 a Group ESG Committee was established, superseding the previous ESG Executive Committee. The/uni00A0Committee is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, in his role as ESG sponsor. Membership of the/uni00A0Committee includes the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the Group HR Director, and senior representatives from the Group's asset owner and asset management business units, including, from/uni00A01 January 2021, the Chief Executives of Eastspring and PACS (Prudential's Singapore business). One of the Group ESG Committee's responsibilities is to oversee the Group's progress towards fulfilling our/uni00A0commitment to report against the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nIn 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported to the Board through the/uni00A0Group Nomination & Governance Committee. The Board recognises that the/uni00A0next 12 to 18 months will be critical for the embedding of the ESG/uni00A0Strategic Framework within the Group, as well as for the progress of related matters such as the development and embedding of the Group's purpose and values, progressing diversity and inclusion (D&I)/uni00A0priorities, and building upon employee engagement activities. Therefore, in early 2021 the Board established a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, to be chaired by Alice Schroeder and/uni00A0comprising four Non-executive Directors, in order to ensure an/uni00A0appropriate level of Board engagement in, and oversight of, these/uni00A0matters during this critical period.\n\nOur Group Governance Manual (GGM) sets out the policies and procedures by which the Group operates. It establishes standards for managing possible ESG issues across the Group. The GGM is subject to a formal content review each year, taking into consideration both internal and external factors.\n\nAs part of the Governance, Risk Management & Internal Control Annual Statement of Compliance certification, all businesses across the Group assess their compliance position against each of the requirements set out in the Group Code of Business Conduct, Policies and Delegated Authorities. Any instances of GGM non-compliance identified by the businesses through their annual attestation are assessed by the Group policy owners and reported to the Group Audit/uni00A0Committee.",

In doing this, Section 172 requires a Director to have regard/uni00A0(among other matters) to the needs of employees, suppliers, customers and other wider stakeholder interests. During 2020 we engaged with our various stakeholder groups closely and we took account of their concerns in our decision-making. Below we have outlined how we have engaged with our stakeholders and the outcome of that engagement.\n\nWe ensure that our Board meets its duty under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act in a number of ways. A briefing note is circulated in advance of each Board meeting reminding Directors of their statutory duties under Section 172 and reiterating who the Group's key stakeholders are. The annual Board evaluation process takes into account how the operation of the Board affects the consideration of stakeholder issues and seeks to identify improvements in this area. We/uni00A0ensure that our Section 172 obligations are taken into account in our Board succession planning and training, stakeholder engagement is addressed in the Board's Terms of Reference, and there is guidance for individuals who prepare Board papers that references Section 172 duties and our key stakeholders. We ensure that we take account of any conflicts between different stakeholder concerns, and resolve such conflicts as smoothly as possible at the highest level necessary.\n\nGood governance and responsible business practices are key strategic enablers to building a sustainable long-term business, as discussed further in our ESG Report on page 111. Through our Group Code of Business Conduct, we ensure that we maintain the highest standards of behaviour throughout our business. Our Group Code of Business Conduct sets out the standards the Board expects in relation to employee behaviour, and our business units run mandatory training programmes to highlight the personal obligations applicable to each individual. The Board reviews both the content of the Group Code of/uni00A0Business Conduct and business unit compliance each year. Meanwhile, our Group-wide whistleblowing programme, Speak Out, enables all stakeholders to raise concerns, helping to maintain the highest standards of behaviour. Whistleblowing reporting is overseen by the Group Audit Committee and business unit audit committees through quarterly reporting and through frequent discussion with the/uni00A0Group Resilience Director, with any material issues reported to the/uni00A0Board. On an annual basis, emerging trends and an assessment of/uni00A0the effectiveness of our whistleblowing approach are reported to/uni00A0the Group Audit Committee.\n\n## Key stakeholder engagement\n\nDuring 2020 we engaged with our various stakeholder groups closely/uni00A0and we took account of their concerns in our decision-making. Three key areas of focus for the Board in 2020 were: the decision to/uni00A0pursue the separation of Jackson in order to focus on the Asia and/uni00A0Africa businesses; the impact of the restrictions imposed by governments across the world as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; and the articulation of our ESG strategy for our business. We describe below how the Board considered the impact on its stakeholders across each of these.\n\nLooking more widely, pages 14 to 15 of this report describes our business model and the outcomes we believe it delivers for each of our key stakeholder groups. The discussion below sets out how the Group has/uni00A0engaged with these key groups during 2020.\n\n## Consideration of stakeholders in key matters addressed by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board\n\n## Decision to pursue the separation of Jackson and focus on the Asian and African businesses\n\nThe Group announced in March 2020 the Board's decision to pursue the proposed separation of Jackson to enable the Group to focus on its/uni00A0Asia and Africa businesses. The Group Chief Executive's report on page 06 sets out/uni00A0the Board's decision and progress on the separation of Jackson. In/uni00A0arriving at this strategic decision the Board took into account the needs of key stakeholders, including investors, colleagues and customers. The Board believes that the Group, and Jackson after the proposed separation, should benefit from improved alignment of/uni00A0management and employees to their businesses, customers and shareholders, and simplified, more efficient, operating and reporting structures. Jackson's separation will complete Prudential's transformation from a diversified, global group into a focused business exclusively targeting the long-term structural opportunities of Asia and Africa. Accordingly, the Prudential Board believes that the proposed demerger will lead to an improvement in strategic, operational and financial execution for both the Group and Jackson after the proposed separation, which will enhance their speed and/uni00A0agility to adapt to their customers' evolving needs and manage stakeholder relationships, and improve financial outcomes for shareholders. The Board has regularly consulted with significant investors as it determined this strategy. As/uni00A0set out below, Board members met with significant investors during the year and discussed the Group strategy proposals.\n\nIn addition, the Board has received regular briefings and engaged in regular communications to employees on the impact of changes arising from the proposed strategy on colleagues prioritising the fair treatment of all employees.\n\nIn determining the strategy of the proposed separation of Jackson, the/uni00A0Board considered that this will enable the Group to focus on meeting the protection and financial security needs of customers in growing markets in Asia and Africa through its differentiated product and geographic portfolio and developing digital platform.\n\n## Impacts arising from the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe Group Chief Executive's report on page 06 sets out the ways the/uni00A0Board and Group have supported our stakeholders during the/uni00A0Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## ESG Strategic Framework\n\nA key factor in determining how the Group builds a sustainable business that addresses the wider concerns and needs of the communities in which it operates is the execution of its ESG strategy. In/uni00A02020, following the completion of the demerger of M&G plc, the Board took the view that it was appropriate to consider the future ESG/uni00A0strategy for the Group, aligned with its business strategy as an Asia-focused Group. It was important that this ESG strategy addressed the needs of all stakeholders, and the importance of the global challenges of climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic, as the business evolves to have a greater digital focus.\n\nThe Board, facilitated by the Nomination & Governance Committee, oversaw the process for the development of the ESG strategy, including the consultation of stakeholder groups to consider their ESG/uni00A0expectations of the Group. These stakeholder groups included investors, regulators, NGOs, governments, employees and rating agencies. A number of common themes emerged from these consultations, including climate change, closing the protection gap and/uni00A0human capital management. These helped inform the direction",

The proposals were discussed with a number of stakeholders across the Group in order to ensure our/uni00A0ESG strategy was fully integrated into the business, and to test and/uni00A0validate the proposed framework. All Board members were invited to provide their input at the start of the strategy development process to shape the suggested areas of focus. They were invited, again, to/uni00A0comment on the strategic framework as it developed. Following management approval by the Group ESG Committee, the framework was then considered by the Nomination & Governance Committee and the Board formally approved it in December 2020. Further details of the strategy and framework are set out on pages 72 to 74.\n\nThe Board recognises that the next 12 to 18 months will be critical for/uni00A0the/uni00A0embedding of the framework within the Group, as well as for/uni00A0the progress of related matters, such as the development and embedding of the Group's purpose and values, progressing D&I priorities, and building upon employee engagement activities in 2020. Therefore, in/uni00A0early 2021, the Board established a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group in/uni00A0order to ensure an appropriate level of/uni00A0Board engagement in, and oversight of, these matters during this critical period.\n\n## Other significant engagement with stakeholder groups Customers\n\nThe Group's purpose is to help people get the most out of life. We/uni00A0do/uni00A0this by making health and financial security accessible and affordable, protecting people's wealth and growing their assets. The/uni00A0needs of our customers are therefore central to what we do.\n\nWe engage directly with our customers through contact centres, dedicated account managers, sales support units, business processing and servicing, face-to-face advice (where possible), mobile phone apps and telephone technical support teams. The development of our/uni00A0digital proposition, specifically our digital health app, Pulse by Prudential, has enabled us to give our customers a greater range of services, including through partnerships with others. This is described in more detail in our Strategic report on page 24. We are attracting a/uni00A0younger demographic and are able to respond quickly to emerging needs. For example, we responded to the pandemic by providing free, limited-time Covid-19 cover for new or existing customers or Pulse users in a number of markets. The Board has actively discussed and supported the evolution of the digital strategy throughout 2020.\n\nThe outcome of our engagements with customers is transmitted through the business and used to shape the design of our products and/uni00A0how and where we distribute those products, and ultimately to inform strategic decisions made at Board level. Decisions about which markets to access, what kind of products to offer and how to develop our agency force, our bank partnerships and our digital capabilities, are all driven by an understanding of what customers want, based on engagement with those customers.\n\n## Investors\n\nThe Group has continued to maintain an open dialogue with investors to ensure that investors' perspectives and concerns are considered in/uni00A0the Board's decision-making. During 2020, Executive Directors attended over 150 meetings, conferences and events with investors, discussing topics including the Group's strategy, financial performance and future development. In addition, the former Chair, Paul Manduca, carried out 10 meetings with investors. The current Chair, in her then capacity as Chair-elect and Non-executive Director, has attended over/uni00A025 meetings with international and UK-based investors both during her introduction to the business and as part of ongoing investor engagement. These investors included large current investors as well as previous holders, but also included smaller institutional groups with specific matters to discuss, such as the Group's engagement with ESG and technology. The/uni00A0Board receives regular updates from the Group Investor Relations team on the Group's continuing wider engagement with investors.\n\nThe scope of discussions focused on the Group's strategy, in/uni00A0particular shareholder views on the question of whether and when to pursue the separation of Jackson and focus on the Asian and African businesses, and Board succession. The perspectives gained from these meetings, and the need for broad investor support, were considered by the Board when making key strategic decisions and communicating those decisions to the market.\n\nThe Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Anthony Nightingale, and the senior Non-executive Director, Philip Remnant, have met with/uni00A0a number of senior investors throughout the year, and the results of these meetings and extensive written communications were considered when determining the Group's Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Our people\n\nOngoing employee engagement is one of the critical factors to ensure successful delivery of the Group's strategic objectives and the Board is/uni00A0keen to increase its focus in this important area. In 2019, the Board expanded the role of two Non-executive Directors to include responsibility for employee engagement: Kai Nargolwala covers our/uni00A0businesses in Asia and Africa, and Tom Watjen is responsible for our UK and US workforce. Following Kai Nargolwala's retirement as a Non-executive Director at the conclusion of the 2021 Annual General Meeting and the planned separation of the Jackson business, the/uni00A0Board intends to transfer responsibility for workforce engagement activities to its newly established Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, which is expected to operate until the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The Working Group has a broad remit as described on page 137. As part of this, it will also consider the best method for employee engagement in the longer term, to ensure this is tailored to the culture and strategic priorities of the refocused Group following the planned separation of the Jackson business, and make a recommendation to the Board for implementation following the 2022/uni00A0Annual General Meeting.\n\nKai Nargolwala and Tom Watjen discharged their duties through a/uni00A0range of interactions with staff during 2020 including:\n\n## -Site visits\n\nOur Non-executive Directors had the opportunity to visit Prudential sites and to interact with our people face-to-face in small groups and through formal meetings where physical meetings were compatible with safe working practices.\n\n## -Virtual events\n\nParticularly during the Covid-19 period, our Non-executive Directors met colleagues through an array of remote events, including the Asia Virtual Regional Conference, staff town halls and meetings of the Jackson D&I Council and the Global D&I Council.\n\n## -Employee survey\n\n95 per cent of staff participated in a Group-wide employee engagement survey carried out in May 2020. This level of participation substantially exceeded our expectations and/uni00A0the market benchmark. The headline level of employee engagement is/uni00A0encouraging and at par with all industries globally, as well as with the insurance and financial services industries. The table below includes a number of insights from the survey. The survey will be/uni00A0repeated in order to assess our progress over time.\n\n## -Collaboration Jam\n\nDuring September 2020, all staff in Asia, Africa and our London head office were invited to join a Collaboration Jam, a 72-hour conversation facilitated online that focused on/uni00A0how the Group can/uni00A0best live its purpose and culture. Over three days, more than 5,400/uni00A0colleagues participated in the Jam, making a/uni00A0total of 14,000 visits and posting nearly 30,000 observations.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

We have engaged with the/uni00A0Hong Kong IA on a regular basis, with the Directors meeting with/uni00A0the/uni00A0regulator on a periodic basis and sharing an agreed range of/uni00A0management information. In September 2020 Mike Wells, Mark/uni00A0FitzPatrick, James Turner and Nic Nicandrou presented to the/uni00A0Regulatory College of Supervisors on the Group's strategy and key/uni00A0business initiatives. The Board also considered and responded to/uni00A0feedback received from the College following its conclusion.\n\nThe Board receives regular updates on our engagement with the Hong/uni00A0Kong IA regarding the shape of its legislative and regulatory framework. We, along with other large insurers in the region, have/uni00A0engaged directly with the supervisor on the development of the/uni00A0proposed Group-wide Supervision (GWS) framework, which is/uni00A0expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong/uni00A0Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements. Discussions covered areas such as capital, risk management and governance issues impacting Prudential and the/uni00A0industry.\n\nThe Hong Kong IA applies principles and standards to the Group through existing requirements to ensure that we are a fit and proper controller of regulated insurance companies. The Hong Kong IA's principles include financial integrity, effective corporate governance and sound risk management. We undertook a gap analysis of the Group's policies and processes against Hong Kong IA requirements for/uni00A0the proposed GWS framework.\n\n## Governments and wider society\n\nDuring 2020, a number of key points emerged from our engagements with governments and legislatures, but the most pressing concern has/uni00A0been how we cooperate with our governmental stakeholders in/uni00A0response to the global health crisis. Covid-19 has underlined the/uni00A0importance of working together with governments and/uni00A0our communities to increase life and health insurance penetration to/uni00A0protect individuals and families. We continue to work with governments, regulators and politicians on ways to close this gap. With/uni00A0the roll-out of Pulse, we have increased our engagement with policymakers on health systems, health financing and the role of technology across our markets. In Hong Kong, we have been actively advocating for a digital health strategy framework to the city's top policymaker in collaboration with the local business community. Our/uni00A0vision is to establish a digital health ecosystem for/uni00A0the city and the/uni00A0Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. During 2020, we have also engaged with policy, regulatory and political stakeholders on COP26 and related themes such as inclusion, the need for a just and inclusive energy transition and the role of private finance in improving responsible investment frameworks.\n\nWe respond to ad hoc requests from NGOs and hold meetings with them throughout the year. During 2020, many of our stakeholders were concerned with the impact of Covid-19 on the communities in/uni00A0which we operate. In response to the pandemic, we launched a/uni00A0$2.5 million Covid-19 relief fund to help support vulnerable communities and provide medical equipment to hospitals and clinics in/uni00A0Asia. The Prudence Foundation partnered with the IFRC and NatGeo to rapidly develop a Safe Steps Covid-19 campaign in response to the pandemic earlier this year. The campaign was distributed across networks in Asia and Africa. More details of our/uni00A0community investment are set out on page 108.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nEach of our critical suppliers has a nominated contact within Prudential, and we meet those suppliers on a regular basis to address concerns on both sides. We wish to treat our suppliers fairly so we both/uni00A0mutually benefit from our relationship. As an example, at the Group's head office in London, to support our supply chain through the/uni00A0difficult trading circumstances triggered by the global pandemic, we provided payment assistance from March 2020. We immediately switched to 10-day payment terms for all our London head office small suppliers with under 100 employees. This has so far benefited 136 suppliers with/uni00A0a/uni00A0total of \u00a36 million of accelerated payments made to assist their/uni00A0cash flow.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews our approach to addressing Modern Slavery in our supply chain.\n\n## About this report\n\nThis report provides a summary of Prudential plc's ESG performance. The contents meet the ESG 'comply or explain' requirements under the Rules Governing Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.\n\nMore information on key topics, such as our tax strategy, can be found in our regular financial reports and standalone reports, available on our website. We aim to disclose our ESG management and performance as/uni00A0transparently as possible. The Board of Prudential plc has approved this report.\n\n## Scope of the ESG report\n\nInformation included in this report covers our activities in the 2020 calendar year, both at Group level and within our various operations globally, including Jackson. It does not include our joint venture partnerships, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Content of the ESG report\n\nWe have continued to evaluate which ESG matters are most material to the Group, with a focus on those that matter most to our stakeholders. In 2020, as part of our ESG strategic review exercise, we considered and refreshed the material ESG issues. This included identifying emerging ESG trends, risks and opportunities directly applicable to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group and our stakeholders. This informed the development of/uni00A0the/uni00A0ESG Strategic Framework. Our 2020 ESG report is structured in/uni00A0line with this framework and provides an update on our progress in/uni00A0the year across each of the pillars and enablers.\n\nThis report includes all mandatory ESG reporting requirements outlined within the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing Rules and all ESG general disclosures and KPIs in the guidance determined to be material, with the exception of A1.3 (Total hazardous waste produced and intensity) and A2.5 (Total packaging materials used for finished products produced), which are not relevant to Prudential plc given the/uni00A0nature of the business.\n\nWhere there are laws and regulations in respect of matters deemed as material which may have a significant impact on Prudential, these are noted within the relevant section of this report. For example, regulatory and legislative developments are increasingly including references to climate-related risks and incorporating reporting recommendations such/uni00A0as those outlined in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. The Group's governance processes require all businesses and functions to demonstrate compliance with Group-wide and local regulatory and legal requirements as part of the/uni00A0annual controls attestation. Further detail on the supervision and regulation of the Group is set out in Prudential plc's Form 20-F report for/uni00A02020 which will be published on Prudential plc's website.\n\nSelected indicators are assured by Deloitte LLP and Deloitte's assurance statement can be found on the Prudential plc website.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Strategic Pillar: Making health and financial security accessible\n\nWe pursue with ambition the closure of the health, protection and savings gaps in Asia and Africa. We see this as core to our purpose to/uni00A0help people to get the most out of life - by making people healthier and wealthier. We are committed to closing these gaps by improving the health and financial wellbeing of those who interact with us, generating positive behavioural change towards healthier lives, and/uni00A0increasing access to healthcare for all.\n\nTo do this we focus on: digital health innovation - to promote inclusion through affordability and accessibility, and healthier outcomes for those we interact with; inclusive offerings - to increase penetration in/uni00A0underserved populations, and bring diversity to our product offering, reflective of our customer base; and digitally enabled financial literacy - to build trust and understanding of protection benefits and/uni00A0options, and wider savings and digital capabilities. In doing this/uni00A0we/uni00A0support our customers to prevent, postpone and protect against ill-health.\n\n## Digital health innovation\n\nAs a leading health insurer in Asia, we are evolving from providing protection to playing a role in the prevention and postponement of/uni00A0ill-health. To make this happen, we believe that the adoption of/uni00A0digital technology at scale is vital.\n\nPulse by Prudential, our health and wealth super-app, is a core part of/uni00A0our strategy to make health and wellness accessible and affordable. Using AI-powered tools and personalised services, Pulse, which is free to download, empowers people to take control of their personal health, anytime and anywhere. The app has been downloaded around 20 million times in Asia and Africa, as of February 2021.\n\nInitially launched in Malaysia in 2019, Pulse is now available across 15/uni00A0markets in Asia and Africa, with relevant services available in local languages. Across our markets, the Pulse offering continues to evolve as we grow our local health and technology partners. Covid-19 has accelerated the impact of Pulse by Prudential, increasing the demand for digital health tools and for healthcare services that can be accessed remotely. More information on the roll-out of Pulse and our digital health response to Covid-19 is available on pages 85 to 86.\n\nWe are committed to developing Pulse into an end-to-end health and/uni00A0wellness platform integrating primary care, wellness and chronic disease management. We work collaboratively with a range of partners to provide value-added services and subscription plans across the health and wellness spectrum to all users. To date, Pulse has integrated 32 local and regional partners. Our partnership with Halodoc in/uni00A0Indonesia enables us to provide a range of telemedicine services through Pulse, including consulting with doctors online and/uni00A0purchasing and arranging the delivery of prescriptions. We are also partnering with Naluri, a Malaysian health tech start-up, to enhance our food journaling user experience within Pulse. This partnership will enable users in the region to access dieticians, helping/uni00A0users plan a healthy and balanced diet, contributing to their wellness goals.\n\nWe recognise the importance of building trust in the markets where we/uni00A0operate. We have worked with health ministries and insurance regulators to understand the local health and financial landscape and/uni00A0the challenges we can help to address. We have also used local epidemiology to understand common health concerns in the region. For example, in Thailand, specific prompts and questions have been built into our symptom checker in recognition of the fact that many common diseases are related to poor water quality or source contamination. We have also worked with public hospitals and doctors to gain insights, which helps us to triage Pulse users appropriately.\n\nOur Pulse app was awarded 'Technology Initiative of the Year' at the/uni00A0Asia Insurance Industry Awards 2020. Pulse was also recognised by the UK government for its positive impact in South-east Asia. The/uni00A0Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has included Pulse in its 'Great for Partnership' initiative, a campaign to promote the/uni00A0best of the UK overseas.\n\nAs we continue to develop Pulse, we have embraced agile ways of working, exemplified by the use of 'hot houses'. During these intense workshops, a wide range of employees from across the Group with different skills and expertise collaborate to explore new ideas, design and implement solutions to deploy into our Pulse app within days, providing immediate benefits to Pulse users.\n\n## Supporting the development of mobile health\n\nThe successful adoption of digital health tools like Pulse is dependent upon the accessibility and acceptance of mobile and digital health tools. We therefore work with a range of stakeholders in the markets where we operate to understand the challenges and opportunities associated with the development of mobile health in local markets.\n\nOur recent report, The Health of Asia Barometer, underscores the unprecedented opportunity offered by digital health technologies to/uni00A0improve access to healthcare in Asia. The report, published by The/uni00A0Economist Intelligence Unit, explores attitudes to healthcare in/uni00A0Asia, highlighting the demand for tools and services to help people in/uni00A0the region better navigate the healthcare system. The report, which/uni00A0surveyed 5,000 adults across 13 markets, highlighted consumer appetite towards the digitisation of health.\n\n- -54 per cent believe that medical care is accessible and affordable;\n- -81 per cent say technology has already improved their access to/uni00A0health services; and\n- -71 per cent will rely on technology even more heavily to improve personal health and wellbeing.\n\nTo fulfil the potential of digital healthcare, the report recommends greater public-private collaboration, suggesting that governments partner with private companies to deliver digitally innovative ways to/uni00A0promote and manage health and wellness among citizens.\n\nIn 2020, we expanded our Singapore-based PRUFintegrate initiative to/uni00A0include our global and regional teams and seven other Prudential business units. The PRUFintegrate initiative is a partner network of fintech, insurtech, healthtech and medtech companies. We received a/uni00A0total of 99 entries, and evaluated solutions from fintech companies based in Asia, Europe and Africa. Our focus in 2020 was on artificial intelligence, as well as the health, wealth and SME ecosystems on Pulse. This global outreach was made possible through the APIX platform that was set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the/uni00A0ASEAN Bankers Association and the World Bank Group's International Finance Corporation.",

        "page_content": "In the Philippines, we continue to support the development of mobile digital health solutions. Following our 2019 white paper exploring the/uni00A0current legal and regulatory framework for mobile health in the Philippines, we launched the 'Healthscape Dialogue Series' during 2020. This seeks to build a multi-stakeholder platform to discuss the most pressing topics in Philippine healthcare, providing an important forum for industry players across sectors to come together and discuss how to improve the access of more Filipinos to affordable and quality healthcare services. Webinars over the course of 2020 have covered the use of AI and mobile technology, preventative healthcare and telemedicine. We also partnered with the Analytics Association of the/uni00A0Philippines to provide a webinar on digital transformation in life insurance and the role of big data in achieving financial inclusion and/uni00A0better health for more Filipinos.\n\n## Inclusive offerings\n\nAs part of our commitment to making health and financial security accessible, we recognise the importance of increasing penetration in/uni00A0the markets where we operate, providing products and services to/uni00A0previously underserved populations. By bringing diversity to our product offering, we will be able to better reflect the needs of our customer base, and integrate any lifestyle impacts from emerging social risks associated with major public health and demographic trends into our product offering. This will include, but not be limited to, lower-income groups, ageing populations, small and medium-sized enterprises and sharia offerings.\n\nDemographics are changing in a number of our markets. In response to/uni00A0Thailand's rapidly ageing population, Prudential Thailand has launched PRUTriple Eight (PRU888), a life insurance plan that allows for effective financial planning at every stage of a person's life. Based on the latest projections by the United Nations Population Fund, Thailand will fully transition into an aged society by 2021, with the number of senior citizens aged 60 and above expected to make up 20 per cent of the total population. As a result, the country will face emergent issues concerning social security, healthcare costs and intergenerational equity in a far shorter time than developed nations. This rapid speed of/uni00A0ageing calls for appropriate response, policies and programmes to help resolve the issues. The PRU888 plan provides financial security to customers including death benefits as well as accidental death coverage where we will pay eight times the normal death benefit up to age 88 while providing annual cashback and a maturity benefit at age 88.\n\nPrudential Indonesia continues to innovate to provide affordable financial protection for Indonesians by launching Asuransi Jiwa Kumpulan Syariah PRUTect Care (PRUTect Care), Prudential Indonesia's first digital product available on our health and wealth super-app, Pulse. As a sharia-based offering, PRUTect Care provides basic natural death benefit coverage, as well as various optional benefits, for a monthly contribution as low as Rp8,000 (US$0.50). To/uni00A0protect more Indonesians, Prudential collaborated with digital partners Gadjian and Kitabisa.com to offer PRUTect Care.\n\nIn 2020, Prudential Indonesia launched Asuransi Jiwa Ayariah PRUCinta (PRUCinta), its first sharia-based traditional life insurance product. A/uni00A0simple and affordable product, PRUCinta provides optimised death compensation benefits covering a period of 20 years. PRUCinta shows Prudential Indonesia's aspirations to become a leading contributor to the Indonesian sharia industry and to expand life/uni00A0insurance coverage to a broader segment of the population.\n\nIn response to outbreaks of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, across South-east Asia, our businesses in Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore have all launched affordable insurance plans to provide customers with cover for dengue fever. Prudential Thailand launched its first digital insurance plan, 'PRUDengue', in partnership with AIS, a leading telecom operator in Thailand's mobile network. AIS customers can purchase PRUDengue via Pulse, launched by Prudential Thailand in June. Dengue fever has impacted nearly one million people in Thailand over the last 10 years. PRUDengue is an all-round and affordable insurance plan to support the insured with a lump-sum payout. PRUDengue's basic package, with an annual premium at/uni00A0THB249 (US$8), provides total benefits of up to THB70,000 (US$2,332). Applicants are not required to complete any health or/uni00A0income check for this plan.\n\nPrudential Cambodia has also launched an affordable insurance solution for dengue fever and malaria. With an annual premium of US$4, the product is Prudential Cambodia's first micro-insurance offering and demonstrates Prudential Cambodia's ambition to making insurance accessible to all Cambodians. With over 34,000 cases of dengue fever in Singapore during 2020, Prudential Singapore launched its affordable insurance plan, PRUSafe Dengue, on Pulse. For/uni00A0a premium of S$5, PRUSafe Dengue provides a number of benefits over a three-month period. In the Philippines, we have also begun to develop bite-sized offerings to help increase insurance penetration and to target specific protection needs of the market. Initial offerings include dengue cover and a breast cancer product.\n\nIn December, Prudential Singapore introduced the Spark Kindness Movement. The movement aims to narrow the protection gap by providing underprivileged families with financial support in the event of accidental death. For every PRUActive Protect or PRUCancer 360 policy sold in December, we provided a complimentary two-year Accidental Death Insurance Coverage of S$10,000 to a parent of a low-income family supported by our community partner, AMKFSC Community Services Limited. This coverage provides hope to the children of these families by giving them the means to continue their education. A total of 3,022 individuals from these families received complimentary coverage through the Spark Kindness Movement and/uni00A0Prudential Singapore plans to extend this programme in the future to benefit more underserved populations.\n\nIn Taiwan, we offer a micro-insurance policy to a non-profit, the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families, to support disadvantaged families and children. During 2020 this policy has helped support 284 families. Our/uni00A0Taiwan life business, PCA Life Assurance, continues to address child/uni00A0protection issues and in November launched its Child Health white paper, to advocate for child health and protection in Taiwan. PCA Life worked with the Research Centre of Big Data at Taipei Medical University to conduct research and analysis into the factors that affect child growth.\n\nIn Malaysia, our CSR initiative, PRUKasih, provides free temporary financial relief to urban low-income families coping with a sudden loss/uni00A0of income due to illness, accident or death. Since this programme started in 2014, more than RM10 million (\u223cUS$2.5 million) has been paid out in claims, and during 2020, we supported 40,429 households across 35/uni00A0communities with PRUKasih. To help PRUKasih communities mitigate the effects of the pandemic, we provided free Covid-19 coverage whereby a cash payment would be made in the event of/uni00A0hospitalisation and/or death.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

This initiative is the first of its kind in Malaysia and provides complimentary basic takaful coverage for a 12-month term to selected heads of the household from low-income groups. Beneficiaries receive RM10,000 (\u223cUS$2,500) in the event that their family breadwinner passes away.\n\nIn Ghana, we have collaborated with leading industry partners to deliver an innovative mobile insurance plan, SafeNet, to new customers. The partnership between Prudential Ghana, Vodafone, MicroEnsure and Enterprise will offer Ghanaians key insurance benefits, including cover for hospital cash compensation, accidental injuries or disabilities, and general life insurance. We have teamed up/uni00A0with Enterprise as co-underwriters for SafeNet, a new mobile insurance product that offers an easy way of buying flexible insurance. Vodafone, Ghana's second-largest mobile network operator, is using a platform developed by MicroEnsure to distribute SafeNet to Vodafone subscribers. In line with our commitment to help limit the economic impact on customers of Covid-19, SafeNet will be offered to more than nine million Vodafone subscribers as free insurance cover in the first half of 2021.\n\n## Helping to upskill small businesses\n\nIn November 2020, Prudential Singapore brought together 80 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across 50 industries and a government agency - SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) - to co-create the SME Skills Accelerator programme. This one-year programme is part of Prudential Singapore's value-added services for SMEs to help them upskill and support them in their innovation efforts. SMEs are entitled to curated training programmes that are subsidised by SSG on topics such as design thinking, digital transformation and workplace learning. As part of the programme, SMEs get to join a network of like-minded people to share best practices and improve processes. SMEs are also connected to a dedicated skills manager who advises on the SMEs' upskilling needs.\n\nRecognising the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), Prudential Indonesia has supported MSMEs across Indonesia by holding a series of financial literacy training webinars, in partnership with AKUMANDIRI, SMESCO and the Tangan di Atas Community. The initiative includes a/uni00A0series of webinar sessions delivered by experts from Prudential Indonesia, covering key financial literacy topics including the importance of financial management, business capital, developing business strategies, and cash flow management for business entities.\n\n## Promoting financial literacy\n\nThe promotion of financial literacy is a priority for Prudential and we actively seek to build trust and improve understanding of protection benefits and options. In doing this we support our customers to prevent, postpone and protect against ill-health. Financial literacy is a/uni00A0key focus area for Prudence Foundation. More information on the broader work of Prudence Foundation can be found in the Community Engagement and Investment section on page 108 of this report.\n\n## Cha-Ching - a global financial education programme\n\nDeveloped by Prudential to address the gap in financial literacy for children, Cha-Ching is a global financial education and responsibility programme aimed at children aged seven to 12. Now in its 10th year, the programme continues to grow and expand across our markets and/uni00A0is well received by educators, parents, children and government stakeholders. We continue to develop a blended learning approach to/uni00A0financial literacy, leveraging digital tools and platforms as well as the school environment. Our aim is to ensure that Cha-Ching is accessible and available to millions of children, parents and teachers across the/uni00A0world for free, providing them with the right foundations in financial literacy.\n\nThe Cha-Ching Curriculum was developed in partnership with Junior Achievement (JA), and has been successfully implemented in Asia for five years through strong partnerships with NGOs and governments in/uni00A0eight markets: the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand. To date, more than 15,000 teachers have been trained to deliver the Cha-Ching Curriculum in schools, with over 600,000 primary school students having been taught the lessons of earn, save, spend and donate.\n\nThe Cha-Ching Curriculum school implementation programme has also expanded into Africa, and in 2020 Prudence Foundation extended its partnership with JA in Africa, to teach the Cha-Ching Curriculum to/uni00A0primary school students across six countries: Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, Nigeria, Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire over the next three years. By adopting the proven teacher-led model for Cha-Ching, which has seen success in Asia, we will similarly work to improve financial literacy in Africa, in a sustainable and scalable way.\n\nIn Asia, the Cha-Ching cartoons continue to be broadcast on Cartoon Network, reaching over 31 million households every day. Cha-Ching content is also accessed online via the website and through digital channels including social media, with over 86 million views to date.\n\nIn an effort to increase the reach and impact of Cha-Ching, we also introduced several new digital initiatives in 2020. These have supported the broader reach of Cha-Ching, particularly in the Covid-19 environment, which has limited in-person teaching, and/uni00A0these are intended to continue into 2021:\n\n- - The Cha-Ching Kid$ At Home programme, aimed at parents, was/uni00A0launched amidst the backdrop of Covid-19. Available for free online, this consists of guides and at-home activities providing families with an engaging and interactive way to teach financial literacy at home. A digital media campaign was launched to raise awareness, reaching more than 3.7 million people via social media. The educational resources have been actively promoted by Prudential businesses through social media campaigns and public webinars and have been viewed or downloaded over 25,000 times via the Cha-Ching website. In Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar, employee volunteers have also been trained to deliver the Cha-Ching Curriculum online through webinars.",

        "page_content": "- -In September 2020, Prudence Foundation introduced the online Cha-Ching Financial Accreditation (CCFA), to acknowledge and support the teacher community working to deliver the Cha-Ching Curriculum in schools across Asia. The CCFA platform was launched in the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam and will expand to further markets in 2021. This online assessment is endorsed by education authorities and was developed in alignment with the OECD Core Competencies Framework on Financial Literacy for Youth and the ASEAN Teachers Competency Framework. To date, over 4,000 teachers have registered and 2,400 have completed the/uni00A0CCFA online course.\n- -In the Philippines, Prudence Foundation and JA have worked closely with the Department of Education (DepEd) to incorporate Cha-Ching into the national distance learning approach implemented in response to Covid-19. Cha-Ching printed materials will be distributed to over 157,000 students at home, supplemented by online teaching where possible. Cha-Ching lessons will also be broadcast via TV and radio as part of DepEd's implementation, expected to reach over 56,000 students.\n- -Cha-Ching videos and parent resources have been made available for free on the Pulse by Prudential app in Singapore with expansion into other markets expected in 2021.\n\nIn the US, the Jackson Charitable Foundation has reached more than/uni00A0eight million students since 2017 by partnering with Discovery Education and Junior Achievement USA. We provide free music videos and classroom and at-home activities with Cha-Ching Money Smart Kids to/uni00A0teach elementary school students how to earn, save, spend and donate. The demand for virtual financial education continues to increase, with Cha-Ching Money Smart Kids seeing record engagement in 2020. The Jackson Charitable Foundation has/uni00A0also sponsored 500 high schools to use Ramsey Education's Foundations in/uni00A0Personal Finance curriculum for the 2020-21 school year, at no cost to the schools. Since this partnership began in 2018, the Foundation has committed $2.7 million toward financial education for high school students across the country, reaching 100,000 students in total.\n\nIn Malaysia, in line with our commitment to uplift PRUKasih communities and build their financial resilience, we introduced education programmes focused on financial planning. We also rolled out the PRUKasih Entrepreneurship Programme to equip participants with entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. To foster greater collaboration between the public and private sectors on financial empowerment through education, we launched a five-part webinar series, featuring a range of panellists, including Malaysia's Central Bank, Bank Negara Malaysia. The webinar series included topics such as the state of financial education in the country and the creation of a unified financial literacy curriculum.\n\n## #MoneyParenting\n\nDuring 2020, our Asian asset manager, Eastspring, launched its #MoneyParenting initiative. Following a survey of 10,000 parents across nine Asian markets, we found that 51 per cent of parents in/uni00A0Asia/uni00A0do not know if they have been successful teachers and role models for their children. Recognising that parents pass on their attitudes and beliefs about finance to children, Eastspring is aiming to/uni00A0help parents become better role models and to provide them with the knowledge, skills and tools to effectively teach their children about money and plan for their future. When asked what help they wanted in/uni00A0order to teach their child how to use and manage money better, 43 per cent of parents across Asia said they wanted to learn more about financial management themselves. In response to the survey and its findings, Eastspring has launched a dedicated microsite on its website, providing tools and resources for parents to empower them as/uni00A0they are teaching their children about the financial and social responsibilities that come with money.\n\n## Pulse roll-out and digital health initiatives\n\nWe have provided some examples to illustrate how we have begun to/uni00A0roll-out Pulse across our businesses. Our Pulse offering continues to/uni00A0develop as we work collaboratively with a range of partners to provide value-added services and subscription plans across the health and wellness spectrum to all users. As we design these services, we consider emerging population risks and public health trends, such as rising levels of obesity, increasing urbanisation and ageing populations.\n\nHong Kong: The launch of Pulse in Hong Kong made us the first in the market to offer an AI-powered chatbot to provide clinically validated information and recommendations for symptoms. Recognising the specific needs of its customers, Pulse users in Hong Kong can access a/uni00A0digital Chinese Medicine Body Constitution Test. Useful information, including hospital listings is/uni00A0now available on Pulse to make information easily accessible for/uni00A0customers.\n\nMalaysia: In October 2020, we launched our Step Up Against Cancer Challenge in Malaysia through Pulse to increase cancer awareness and/uni00A0to highlight the importance of financial protection against cancer. Users are challenged to take at least 5,000 steps a day in order to earn free cancer coverage. Users can connect their fitness device to the Pulse app, allowing them to earn different levels of cancer coverage, depending on the number of steps they take.\n\nIndonesia: Following the release of Pulse in Indonesia, the #SehatBarengPulse (Get Healthy with Pulse) movement was launched. The campaign encouraged users to lead a healthier lifestyle through a/uni00A0series of challenges, including lowering sugar intake and cholesterol/uni00A0levels.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The app also includes hundreds of articles equipping users with medical information on healthy lifestyles, symptoms and treatments. Prudential Vietnam also introduced an online cancer insurance product, iProtect, on Pulse in September.\n\nCambodia: Prudential Cambodia was the first to bring AI-based preventative healthcare to Cambodia, through the launch of Pulse. Health infrastructure in Cambodia in both the public and private sectors is underdeveloped, and convenient access to quality healthcare is difficult for most Cambodians. The initial Pulse roll-out included a 'hospital locator' feature for users to access all hospitals and/uni00A0clinics covered under the National Social Security Fund, which is/uni00A0a/uni00A0social health safety net for two million people employed in the formal sector.\n\n## Digital health response to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nHong Kong: Prudential was the first in the market to launch free Covid-19 coverage to over 300,000 Hong Kong residents. Following rapid take-up, we offered free protection to a further 200,000 Hong Kong residents. During the fourth wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, Prudential Hong Kong announced that it would allocate HK$5 million to its Covid-19 Caring Fund, which provides additional financial support for individuals affected by Covid-19. Eligible applicants can apply through the Pulse app to receive a subsidy of HK$10,000 to relieve their financial burden caused by the pandemic.\n\nSingapore: Pulse was launched in Singapore in April 2020, and was/uni00A0a/uni00A0key part of our response in supporting the community in the fight/uni00A0against the virus. Users of the app were entitled to a daily hospitalisation allowance if they were hospitalised for Covid-19. Prudential Singapore also subsidised part of the consultation costs for/uni00A0users until 30 June 2020, so it cost only S$15 per consultation. Non-customers were eligible to receive a S$100 daily allowance (for/uni00A0up/uni00A0to three months of hospitalisation) if they were hospitalised between the date of their Pulse app registration and 31 May 2020.\n\nIndonesia: In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Prudential Indonesia provided free Covid-19 coverage and was the first in the market to offer additional protection for Covid-19. Prudential Indonesia also extended the grace period for premium payments, simplified its claims procedure and established a dedicated team for Covid-19 claims. Leveraging Pulse, Prudential Indonesia and Halodoc provided premium-free Covid-19 rapid tests for members of the public in Jakarta/uni00A0and Surabaya. Prudential Indonesia also launched PRUCekatan to/uni00A0enable customers to consult with their agents and access comprehensive protection solutions virtually, rather than through face-to-face meetings.\n\nThailand: To encourage social distancing during the pandemic, Prudential Thailand partnered with 10 hospitals in Thailand to offer customers access to specialist healthcare services and medication via/uni00A0telemedicine. Customers could choose to schedule a consultation with a doctor via video conference, purchase and arrange for delivery of prescription medicine to their homes or arrange for a home visit by/uni00A0a/uni00A0doctor if necessary.\n\nAfrica: Across our eight markets in Africa, we provided customers, staff and agents with a range of additional Covid-19 insurance cover at/uni00A0no cost to themselves. Prudential Africa also simplified its claims procedures and enabled claims to be made via WhatsApp. Additional training was provided to our agents and we enabled customers to buy/uni00A0insurance without the need to meet face-to-face with an agent.\n\nLaos: Prudential Laos extended the grace period for premium payments from 30 days to 60 days. Free Covid-19 coverage was also/uni00A0provided for all existing policyholders, as well as for new policies purchased between 1 May and 31 August 2020. Free Covid-19 cover was offered to the staff of hotels providing quarantine services. In May, Prudential Laos donated 3,000 face shields to the Ministry of Health to/uni00A0protect frontline workers against Covid-19.\n\nThe Philippines: Pulse launched in the Philippines in February 2020 and at/uni00A0the onset of the pandemic, was used to provide free Covid-19 protection and personal accident coverage - a one-time, 45-day insurance product to protect the insured against death from Covid-19 or accident. It was the first insurer in the country to offer extra protection against Covid-19.\n\nMalaysia: Prudential was the first insurer in Malaysia to introduce Covid-19 coverage for our customers and this was subsequently extended to non-customers at no additional cost. In the initial stages of/uni00A0the pandemic, we launched public service announcements and content on Pulse and various media channels to educate the public about the virus and how to stay safe. We also supported the Ministry of Health's efforts to conduct more Covid-19 tests by reimbursing our customers for taking the test. Customers facing financial difficulties were able to apply to our premium deferment relief programme.",

Strategic Pillar: Stewarding the human impacts of climate change\n\nWe recognise that climate change presents a serious global challenge, with significant potential economic consequences and direct and indirect impacts on people's health and livelihoods, and we are proactive in enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy. We do this by decarbonising our investment portfolio and working towards sustainable development and energy transition in all our markets. Reflecting the stage of their development, the economies in which we operate tend have a greater reliance on fossil fuels and more exposure to carbon intensive industries than in more developed markets. For example, for the five largest South-east Asian economies of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam (plus China) an average of/uni00A036.2 per cent of GDP was derived from mining, manufacturing and/uni00A0other industrial activities in 2018. This compared to 18.6 per cent and 17.5 per cent for the US and UK respectively in the same year. This/uni00A0means that the energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a different pace than for more advanced economies. Recognising this, as we support the move to a lower-carbon economy in these emerging markets, we strive to ensure that the transition is an inclusive one for all of society - one that supports sustainable growth and economic health within our local markets and communities.\n\n## Decarbonising our investment portfolio\n\nOur strategic focus on stewarding the human impacts of climate change through decarbonisation of our investment portfolio over time/uni00A0recognises that climate change presents long-term risks to the/uni00A0sustainability of our business. It also acknowledges that, as a responsible corporate citizen, Prudential needs to play its part in the transition to a lower carbon global economy and the collective efforts to limit the rise in global warming that can lead to catastrophic climate change. As a significant investor and an asset owner with long-term investment horizons and liabilities, the Group is vulnerable to climate-related transition risks, and in a position to invest in, and develop, products linked to climate resilience. Our approach to reducing the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio is one which supports sustainable growth and takes into consideration the impact on the economies, businesses and customers in the markets in which we operate and invest.\n\n## Approach to climate-related risk\n\nPrudential is a signatory to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our approach to climate change and climate-related risk is covered below. To show how we are meeting TCFD requirements, we/uni00A0have mapped our disclosures to each of its pillars. This is shown in/uni00A0a/uni00A0table at the end of this section of the report.\n\nInitially categorised as emerging risks, the ESG risks associated with our business, which include climate risk, have more recently been upgraded to Group Principal Risk status. Recently, we have engaged a dedicated climate risk consultancy to further refine our understanding of the nature and materiality of the risks posed by climate change to the/uni00A0business.\n\nThe table below lists the key climate risks facing Prudential.

        "page_content": "The risks are also influenced by the broader political, economic and societal backdrop in which the Group operates. These factors interact with, and can amplify and shape, the impacts of climate-related risks. Examples of risk factors that could exacerbate climate risks include geopolitical issues, political processes, such as negotiations to curb emissions, or the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic, which is reshaping global economic activity.\n\n## Activity throughout 2020\n\nWork to quantify and model the nature of our climate risk exposure has/uni00A0continued throughout 2020, consistent with our strategic focus on climate change risk and in alignment with the TCFD recommendations. The Group Risk and Group Actuarial functions have led efforts to deepen understanding of the exposure to climate-related risks in our asset management and asset owner businesses across the Group. Activity has included the identification of metrics to measure exposure to greenhouse emissions, measuring the carbon footprint of our asset book, the selection of scenarios for stress testing assets, and investment in new tools to support carbon footprinting and scenario analysis.\n\nA key activity has been the use of scenario analysis to model the Group's exposure to climate-related risk, assuming different transition pathways and temperature scenarios (see case study). The modelling has helped to further our understanding of the nature of the climate risk the Group faces. This has reinforced that the main financial risk is/uni00A0to the asset side of the balance sheet. This finding is consistent with our business model: as a major asset owner and manager, we rely on investment returns to meet the longer-term obligations of our liabilities and thus are vulnerable to risks that interrupt or impair those returns. The finding also reinforces the case for the strategic objective to decarbonise the investment portfolio, which is both a way in which Prudential can limit its exposure to potential transition risks, as well as/uni00A0contribute to global efforts to decarbonise the global economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe potential impact from climate risk on our insurance liabilities has/uni00A0also been investigated. To better understand the potential impact to our insurance liabilities, a qualitative assessment of the impact of/uni00A0climate-related risk on insurance risk was carried out by Group Actuarial during the year. This established that over the short term, such as over the three years of the current business plan cycle, climate change is not expected to materially increase or decrease claims for our life and health business. Over the longer term, the financial impacts from climate-related risks on our insurance liabilities could be more significant, for example on reserving implications, if there is a step change in long-term morbidity and/or mortality expectations, and/uni00A0medical inflation. However, the overall financial impact will be mitigated by our ability to reprice contracts and develop new products.\n\n## Response to climate-related risks\n\nWe believe that the new strategic ESG framework and the long-term goals to decarbonise the investment portfolio and support an inclusive transition are an important way in which we can meet to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfil our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce the Group's exposure to asset risk - which includes transition risk - over time, while also contributing to efforts to decarbonise the global economy.\n\nRecognising that transition risk represents the nearest-term and most/uni00A0impactful financial risk to the Group, the Group Risk function undertook an initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets managed in segregated portfolios by the Group's asset managers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCase study\n\n## Modelling climate change risk: The role of scenario testing\n\nDuring 2020, the Group undertook a stress testing exercise based on the three scenarios laid out within the PRA Insurance Stress Tests: orderly transition (temperature increases kept below 2\u00b0C , meeting the Paris Agreement); disorderly transition (temperature increases kept below 2\u00b0C but with delayed and sudden policies); and failure to meet the Paris Agreement (specifically, reaching a temperature increase in excess of 4\u00b0C assuming no transition and a/uni00A0continuation of current policy trends), with a time horizon up to 2100. The Group's entire asset portfolio was included, and the testing included the impact of physical and transition risk on the asset portfolio for the chosen scenarios. The impacts of climate change on insurance liabilities was also investigated.\n\nThese stress tests have informed discussions on how to assess the/uni00A0Group's business objectives and strategy and have provided further insight into the capabilities and data required for future stress modelling. These analyses have also been complemented by/uni00A0reviewing alternative scenario testing methodologies using tools provided by specialist vendors or open solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is continuing to explore and develop its scenario analysis approach, including investigating the use of the Group's economic capital model, and ultimately formalise the process for conducting sophisticated climate scenario analysis as part of the Group's risk management frameworks.",

        "page_content": "This/uni00A0focused on investments where Prudential both maintains direct control of the mandate and exerts some influence over the investment process. Provisional reports were produced using climate-related data and metrics provided through a proprietary vendor tool. This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint metrics of the asset book and highlights the most carbon-intensive sectors, including those most at risk of being stranded. It/uni00A0also enables the most carbon-intensive companies held in the asset book - and thus the largest issuer contributors to the overall metrics - to be determined and monitored. We have also determined the initial weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes of our insurance investment portfolio.\n\nBuilding on this work, we are continuing to develop metrics that are appropriate for our business, to support an enhanced management and reporting process for climate risk. As well as WACI, other potential metrics under consideration include the percentage of the portfolio in carbon-intensive sectors, stranded asset exposure as a percentage of assets under management, and portfolio exposure to clean technology solutions. These metrics were considered at a Board Risk Committee workshop held to discuss the potential business impacts of transition and physical climate risks. Work to enhance the management and reporting of climate risk will continue in collaboration with our asset management and asset owner business units, with the aim of integrating climate risk metrics and monitoring into broader investment processes and aligning with the responsible investment framework.\n\nWe also continue to develop our scenario testing capabilities and have engaged with a climate risk consultancy to perform a focused exercise using their scenario modelling capability. Investigating different methodologies supports the Group's ability to determine climate scenarios appropriate to its nature, scale and complexity. The potential impacts of different scenarios on the balance sheet were discussed in 2020 with the Technical Actuarial Committee (TAC), which sets the methodology for the economic capital model. To date, the impacts have been indirectly incorporated into the economic capital model via/uni00A0the market risk calibrations. No additional adjustment is considered necessary at this time and this will be kept under regular review.\n\nOur existing business continuity management programmes are assessing the risk of natural disasters, including those caused by significantly altered climatic conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of tropical storms or increased flooding. The Group remains focused on its operational resilience and is supplementing existing activities with scenario analysis to identify additional areas of/uni00A0vulnerability that may arise due to climate change, including assets, operations, third party supply chains and customers. Group Risk has trialled a number of dedicated risk management platforms and has shared the outputs with/uni00A0local business continuity teams to help inform assessment and management of physical risks to operations in territories for which they/uni00A0are responsible.\n\n## Transparency and engagement\n\nAs well as the work to enhance internal management and reporting of/uni00A0climate-related information, we participate in external benchmarks to provide additional visibility to stakeholders on our climate-related activity. We aim continually to improve the transparency and utility of/uni00A0our reporting.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to participate in CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and maintained our score with a B grading (2019:/uni00A0B). We continue to participate in ClimateWise and received an improved score of 68 per cent (2019: 51 per cent), which we believe reflects the progress we have made over the year in/uni00A0our management and reporting of climate issues.\n\nTo help address industry issues, such as the limitation of climaterelated disclosures and evolution of data availability and climate risk modelling for financial market participants, we participate in industry bodies that can help drive improvements in risk management processes and lobby for improved standards.\n\nWe also seek to collaborate with peers and other investors to amplify the impacts of our activity in this area. These activities are described in/uni00A0more detail in the Responsible Investment section on page 101.\n\nAs noted in the list of material risks, the pace and volume of regulatory and legislative compliance developments poses a challenge to the Group. As part of our ongoing government relations activity, we/uni00A0regularly engage with regulators and monitor evolving climate risk-related initiatives that could develop into new regulation in the markets in which we operate. In a similar manner, we also engage constructively with policymakers and NGOs to shape the evolution of/uni00A0regulation and standards relating to climate risk. For example, during/uni00A02020 Prudential Hong Kong joined an industry-wide task force established by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority and Hong Kong Federation of Insurers to work on several areas within 'green insurance'. More information on our engagement and regulatory interactions, including those related to climate risks and opportunities, can be found in the Responsible Investment section on page 101.\n\n## Supporting an inclusive transition\n\nOur Asian markets include highly developed economies such as Hong/uni00A0Kong and Singapore that have diversified, service-led economies and mature financial markets, and emerging markets that are more dependent on primary and energy-intensive industries. These emerging markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels in their generation mix, and less developed financial systems.\n\nThis means that the energy transition across the region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for advanced economies as reflected in/uni00A0the countries' Nationally Determined Contributions, as required by the Paris Agreement. This point was highlighted by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing for Good Asia Digital Conference on 13 October 2020, Mr Menon noted that 'Asia is at a different stage of development, with millions of people still lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, and drinking water. While demand for affordable energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic to suddenly replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.'\n\nFor Prudential, this means that, while we are committed to an objective to decarbonise our investment portfolio, we are mindful of the need to/uni00A0implement the strategy in a way that acknowledges the nature of the/uni00A0markets in which we operate and seeks to share the financial and social burden of the transition in a fair manner. Our support for an inclusive transition aims to balance our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders.\n\nWe recognise the importance of coalition building in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member of the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World Economic Forum with support from the OECD, we work with public and private sector institutions in emerging markets, particularly in South-east Asia,/uni00A0to scale domestic and international investment in sustainable infrastructure and promote energy transition. The SDIP's ASEAN Hub, whose Steering Group Prudential has co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, a monthly forum to catalyse new ideas for scaling up investments to further the/uni00A0SDGs.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Capturing opportunities\n\nWe also recognise that the implementation of our strategic ESG framework can generate opportunities for the Group. Some of these opportunities will come through our efforts to take early mitigating action against the climate risks we identify, including incorporating transition risk into investment decisions to reduce the risk of being exposed to stranded assets.\n\nOthers will come through supporting an inclusive transition. The/uni00A0infrastructure and capital expenditure required to enable the transition represents attractive investment opportunities in many cases. For example, there is a role for institutions to both develop new/uni00A0products and invest in structures and mechanisms that enable a/uni00A0managed withdrawal from reliance on coal-powered electricity within developing economies.\n\nIn response to this, we have developed several responsible investment products that channel our customers' savings towards ESG-themed investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More information on our ESG-related investment activity is available in the Responsible Investment section on page 101.\n\nClimate change is also likely to drive demand for new health products, given the linkage of climate change to human health through changes in the incidence of diseases and the emergence of new diseases. We/uni00A0have launched a dengue alert service to customers in some Asian/uni00A0markets through our Pulse super-app. The decision to offer the application reflects the increasing incidence of dengue fever in the region, driven by warmer temperatures and higher humidity. This alert service is complemented by the provision of affordable insurance plans for the markets in which dengue is prevalent - see Inclusive offerings within Making health and financial security accessible for more information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Case study\n\n## Helping Asia exit from coal: The Energy Transition Mechanism\n\nWriting for the World Economic Forum as part of the Great Reset series in May 2020, Don Kanak, then chairman of Eastspring, outlined a proposal for a 'Coal Retirement Mechanism', which would accelerate the transition to renewables in developing countries where coal use is high and poised to grow - see www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/how-to-replace-coal-andaccelerate-the-energy-transition-in-developing-countries/. An investment fund would be established in collaboration with national authorities consistent with climate commitments to purchase and retire coal fired power plants over 10 to 15 years, cutting short their expected lifetimes of 30 to 40 years or more. Investors in the fund would include developed country governments and multilateral banks with access to low-cost capital. The proposal is an example of how we are seeking to support the markets and communities in which we operate to manage the challenge of the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince then, the proposal has been updated and renamed as the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) and was published on the World Economic Forum as part of the 2021 Davos Agenda series. The ETM would accelerate the retirement of carbon-intensive power assets, dramatically expand demand for renewables, and/uni00A0provide time and resources for a just transition. www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/how-to-accelerate-theenergy-transition-in-developing-economies.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOver the next three years, we will work to strengthen management of/uni00A0climate risk across the Group. We will approach this as a Group-wide cross-functional initiative, with participation from our asset owner and asset manager businesses, risk, actuarial, and government relations colleagues.\n\nScenario analysis will be an important area of focus as we plan to move it into our mainstream risk management processes during 2021 and to begin internally reporting findings within Group and business unit level management information. As we further investigate how climate risk impacts our business in the long term, we aim to operationalise and to continue to increase the use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as the Bank of England's exploratory climate risk scenario for banks and insurers in/uni00A02 021.\n\nWe are aware that many companies have set targets in alignment with/uni00A0the Paris Agreement. We are in the process of assessing similar suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions from our investments, given their importance within our overall emissions profile, and our overarching strategic commitment to decarbonising our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the interim, we continue to increase our level of ambition in relation to our own emissions footprint. This year we have set new and stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end of 2030. More information on the environmental impact of our direct operations is available on page 114.\n\nDuring 2021 we will continue to scale up our engagement strategy with key policy and political stakeholders around the COP26 conference in November with a focus on financial sector issues to/uni00A0support the just transition and sustainable finance priorities in/uni00A0particular for emerging markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Strategic Pillar: Building social capital\n\nWe are committed to building both our own human capital and our social capital with our broader stakeholders. We do this by promoting diversity in representation and thought, and fostering a culture of inclusion and a sense of belonging within our organisation. As an organisation, we depend not only on the trust of our people, but also the trust of the external world. As we develop our digital capabilities, we prioritise digital responsibility throughout our organisation. Our/uni00A0focus on the needs and interests of our users is central to our investment in new technologies, shaping how we interact with them and handle their personal data as our capabilities progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity, inclusion and belonging\n\nWe are committed to building our human capital, seeking to empower our people and unlock their potential. We do this by striving for diversity in representation and thought, and fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging within our organisation. During 2020, we launched a new inclusive purpose statement: We help people get the most out of life.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion strategy\n\nIn 2020, we established a Global Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Council, co-chaired by our Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer and Group HR Director, with representation from colleagues across the Group. The Council replaces regional advisory committees and groups. During 2020, we also appointed our first Group Diversity & Inclusion Director to help support our ambition in this area. The D&I Council is responsible for defining our global D&I strategy and supporting programmes, promoting and championing D&I initiatives in/uni00A0respective business units and challenging the organisation when progress is limited. The Council reports to the Nomination & Governance Committee twice a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Case study\n\n## Defining inclusive leadership behaviours\n\nDuring 2020, as part of its commitment to establish inclusive leadership at all levels, the Global D&I Council held a workshop with representatives from across our businesses in order to define our inclusive leadership behaviours. The workshop concluded with a panel session with external speakers, entitled, 'Leaders make change happen'. Our inclusive leadership behaviours are to:\n\n- -Nurture inclusion - seek out and embrace diverse perspectives;\n- -Cultivate transparency - provide visibility and display authenticity and vulnerability;\n- -Actively sponsor - recognise, develop and support talent;\n- -Drive accountability - take personal responsibility for behaviours and outcomes; and\n- -Demonstrate care - demonstrate genuine care and interest in/uni00A0others.\n\nThese behaviours have been embedded into our leadership development frameworks and senior leadership recruitment processes, as well as into our new values. During 2021 we will continue to reinforce inclusive leadership and behaviours in development and training interventions to help our leaders and people to understand and embed the behaviours we wish to promote. We will also focus on embedding inclusive leadership traits into performance management objectives to reward the behaviours that strengthen belonging and enhance inclusion. Inclusive leadership behaviours will also form a part of our assessment of candidates during the recruitment process.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The Charter is aligned to our purpose and states that the Council will deliver our purpose by creating a/uni00A0culture in which diversity is celebrated and inclusion assured, for/uni00A0our/uni00A0colleagues, customers and partners.\n\n## The Charter makes the following commitments:\n\n- -D&I approach to be clear and public;\n- -Establish inclusive leadership at all levels, role modelled from/uni00A0the/uni00A0top;\n- -Illustrate how inclusive leadership drives innovation and/uni00A0supports greater connectivity;\n- -Inclusion to be integral in the Prudential values which guide behaviours;\n- -Reshape our recruitment, reward and recognition programmes to eliminate bias;\n- -Engage suppliers and corporate partners committed to/uni00A0inclusive/uni00A0practices; and\n- -Product offerings which address the diversity of our customer/uni00A0needs.\n\nThe D&I Charter also outlines our Group D&I Policy, which aims to actively promote employee diversity and provide equal opportunities to all who apply for and those who perform work within our organisation, including our Directors. The policy applies to all of our/uni00A0business units and promotes diversity irrespective of sex, race, age, ethnic origin, social and cultural background, marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy, maternity and paternity, any gender reassignment, religion or belief, sexual orientation, disability, or part-time/fixed-term working arrangements. The policy also promotes diversity of experience, skill sets and professional backgrounds and is/uni00A0reviewed annually by our Group HR Director. We give full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled persons and make appropriate arrangements for continuing the employment of, and arranging training for, employees who have become disabled. We seek to promote the training, career development and progression of disabled persons, making appropriate adaptations where required. Chief Human Resource Officers across our business units are responsible for/uni00A0the implementation, monitoring and review of the policy locally and, as/uni00A0part of the management of the Group Governance Manual, each business unit confirms to Group HR that it has complied with all/uni00A0of/uni00A0our HR policies, including the D&I Policy.\n\nIn line with our new D&I Charter, a number of initiatives have taken place during 2020 to improve inclusivity at Prudential. We have conducted a review of recruitment processes, with a new Group Recruitment Policy embedding D&I measures to be introduced in 2021. We are working to mitigate bias in recruitment practices by reviewing the language used in job descriptions and by using more objective selection tools. During 2020, Jackson doubled the period of/uni00A0paid parental leave available to all new parents and quadrupled the benefit to cover adoption expenses. Parental leave arrangements in Asia were also reviewed, with changes including an increase in the period of paid leave by a third and the introduction of paid leave when/uni00A0an employee becomes a parent through adoption or surrogacy. Our/uni00A0HR function has formed a working group with our Risk function to/uni00A0more visibly encourage 'speaking up' and to find constructive ways/uni00A0to call out non-inclusive behaviour. This complements our new Consensual Relationship Policy and Discrimination and Harassment Policy, both of which apply from January 2021. These policies reflect/uni00A0our continuing commitment to a professional and supportive working environment, where everybody is treated fairly, has equal opportunities, and is respected and valued for their contributions to/uni00A0our Company.\n\n## D&I performance\n\nAs a signatory to the HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter since 2016, we have a target of 30 per cent women in senior management by/uni00A0the end of 2021. At 31 December 2020 this figure was 32 per cent. The Hampton-Alexander Review set recommendations in 2016 for FTSE 350 companies to achieve a minimum 33 per cent target for women on boards and in the/uni00A0two layers of leadership below the board by the end of 2020. At/uni00A0the/uni00A0end of 2020, 29 per cent of our Board was made up of women.\n\nWhile we did not meet recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander Review as at 31 December 2020, Shriti Vadera replaced Paul Manduca as Chair on 1 January 2021 and Chua Sock Koong and Ming/uni00A0Lu will be/uni00A0joining the Board in May 2021. With these changes, following the retirement of Kai Nargolwala at the AGM, the representation of women on the Board will increase to 36 per cent. We/uni00A0have met the recommendation of the Parker Review to have at least one director from an ethnic group background on the Board. While our diversity figures have improved year-on-year, we recognise that we have more to do in this area. As/uni00A0such, during 2021 we will establish new diversity targets and our local business units will define their own targets and plans to meet these objectives.\n\nDuring 2020 we again submitted responses to the ShareAction Workforce Disclosure Initiative and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, being listed on the 2021 index for the first time.",

The 2020 Senior Managers definition includes the local business unit CEOs, Chief/uni00A0Officers and other business critical staff.\n- 3   Excludes Prudential Corporation Asia Joint Ventures.\n- 4   No specification or information is captured on gender for an immaterial number of/uni00A0our employees. These employees are recorded as 'unspecified'.\n- 5   In some of our businesses, we provide our employees with the option to not disclose their gender. For these employees, gender is recorded as 'undisclosed'.\n\nDue to Covid-19, activities of the affinity networks at Prudential in 2020 were limited, although some key events did take place. Across various locations, Prudential Corporation Asia's PruPride network once again hosted a Pink Day in October, with active participation in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia and Thailand. A women's network event with a virtual panel session in September, attended by/uni00A0185 colleagues on the topic 'Leaders make change happen', was/uni00A0hosted by Group Human Resources Director Jolene Chen and/uni00A0Non-executive Director Alice Schroeder. Our new Board Chair, Shriti Vadera, hosted an in-person networking event in November with Eastspring colleagues in Singapore. Jackson's business resource and affinity groups (BRAGs), each supported by one or more executive sponsors, continued their activities through the year: Pride (LGBT+); VIBE (Vision in Black Excellence); Jackson Young Professionals; Empower (women's network); Enable (for disabled people); and Associates-in-motion (for pre-retirees). A focus for 2021 is to enhance our governance procedures and structures for affinity networks to support them through a global engagement programme to enhance employee engagement globally, regionally and locally.\n\n## Racial justice - Jackson's response to the killing of George Floyd\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in late May, the US experienced protests that raised awareness and heightened discussion of issues related to racial bias, structural racism and social justice. The ramifications of these events have broadly impacted society, including the business community and Jackson directly. Jackson's leadership has actively engaged with associates on these issues and continues to engage on this issue.\n\nIn the week following the killing of George Floyd, Jackson's D&I Advisory Council held meetings with the Visions in Black Excellence (VIBE) affinity group and senior leaders to discuss the impact on associates and Jackson's response. Jackson-wide communications from Jackson's CEO reinforced the message of 'One Jackson' and encouraged associates to support each other. Jackson hosted a series of all-associate panels and training opportunities, including a 'Listening/uni00A0to our Peers' panel to hear associates' experiences with racism. Jackson and VIBE also held a celebration for Juneteenth and the PRIDE affinity network hosted a discussion with Liliana Reyes, a/uni00A0Latinx, transgender woman and civil rights activist.\n\nJackson also introduced two training courses that were mandatory for/uni00A0all associates. The first addressed the stereotype threat that exists/uni00A0when actions, conscious or not, contribute to persistent racial segregation. The second addressed the impact of affinity biases that/uni00A0influence workplace choices, based on perceived similarities and/uni00A0differences.\n\nJackson also made charitable contributions of $250,000 to NAACP Lansing Chapter, $100,000 to Urban League of Middle Tennessee, and $100,000 to Facing History and Ourselves in Chicago. This investment signals Jackson's commitment to local philanthropy, which presents an/uni00A0opportunity to further engage Jackson's affinity groups as partners in equitable community involvement.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nEngagement with our people is a key priority for Prudential and the/uni00A0Board. Two of our Non-executive Directors, Kai Nargolwala for/uni00A0Asia/uni00A0and Africa and Tom Watjen for the US and the UK, were appointed to represent the interests of our people, a duty which they discharged through a range of interactions with staff during 2020. While the Covid-19 pandemic limited opportunities for our Non-executive Directors to interact with our people, a number of face-to-face meetings in small groups took place. Non-executive Director engagement was supplemented with virtual events and our/uni00A0Non-executive Directors also met colleagues through an array of/uni00A0remote events, including the Asia Virtual Regional Conference, staff/uni00A0town halls and meetings of the Jackson Diversity & Inclusion Council and the Global D&I Council.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

To further engage our people in defining our values as well as to signal our intent to foster open, honest and two-way dialogue across the Company, we/uni00A0hosted a Collaboration Jam in September 2020. A three-day inclusive online conversation, the Collaboration Jam provided a platform for colleagues to connect and co-create solutions for the issues that matter most to employees. More than 5,400 colleagues participated, resulting in nearly 30,000 comments and/uni00A0posts. The/uni00A0most popular discussion threads were 'Open Conversations', 'Listening to Others' and 'Change and Agility'. Building on this activity and the progress made to date, we will commence a three-year journey to embed the desired culture and/uni00A0position Prudential as a place where people can connect, grow/uni00A0and/uni00A0succeed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother global employee survey was undertaken in January 2021 to/uni00A0help assess the effectiveness of actions taken during the year and to/uni00A0highlight our focus areas for 2021. We have made notable progress in many areas, including learning, feedback and recognition, and diversity and inclusion. Collaboration and communication was our most improved factor, up by 7 percentage points.\n\nFollowing Kai Nargolwala's retirement as a Non-executive Director at the conclusion of the 2021 Annual General Meeting and the planned separation of the Jackson business, the Board intends to transfer responsibility for workforce engagement activities to its newly established Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, which is expected to operate until the 2022 Annual General Meeting. As part of/uni00A0this, it will also consider the best method for employee engagement in the longer term, to ensure this is tailored to the culture and strategic priorities of the refocused Group following the planned separation of/uni00A0the Jackson business, and make a recommendation to the Board for/uni00A0implementation following the 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Global employee survey\n\nWe are committed to building a culture that is purpose-led, customer-focused, and digitally-savvy. In May 2020, we conducted an/uni00A0engagement survey to establish a baseline of cultural health and validate our proposed purpose and values in a bottom-up manner.\n\nThe survey was conducted using an industry-leading employee engagement platform that provides a range of surveys and broad global benchmarks across industries. More than 11,400 employees from Asia, Africa and the UK participated in the survey, producing a/uni00A095 per cent response rate. In the US, Jackson carries out its own employee survey and was therefore not included in this survey.\n\nThe engagement survey covered topics including leadership, communication, innovation, career and work-life balance. The survey design was based on academic research and good practice among organisational psychologists. The survey found that 85 per cent of colleagues are proud to work for Prudential. Areas for improvement include communication, collaboration, feedback and work-life balance.\n\nFollowing the survey, briefings were conducted for the Group Executive Committee as well as the two Non-executive Directors responsible for workforce engagement. The Board received an update/uni00A0on the survey results in July 2020 and summary briefings were/uni00A0provided to stakeholder groups across the Company. Each local business unit has now undertaken detailed action planning in response to its results. Group-wide actions include the launch of a sciencebased mental health and wellbeing app, the Collaboration Jam (see/uni00A0case study) and the strengthening of Speak Out, our Group-wide whistleblowing programme.\n\n## Leadership and talent development\n\nTo ensure appropriately targeted leadership and talent development initiatives, we define various leadership and talent segments across our/uni00A0Group. Our senior leaders continue to play a critical role in driving strategic initiatives, which advance the Group's strategy and culture across our markets, business units and functions. To future-proof our success in an increasingly digital environment, we have redefined the leadership capabilities that we need to drive the business, focusing on/uni00A0inspiring followership when teams work both remotely and from an/uni00A0office; fostering innovation by enabling disruption while ensuring psychological safety; delivering at pace and scale through digital and agile practices; and developing sustainable commercial strategies to deliver aggressive business growth with social responsibility.\n\nWithin the leadership community, we focus on the Executive Council and the Senior Management Teams (SMTs). The Executive Council is/uni00A0a/uni00A0small group of individuals holding pivotal Group roles and with key/uni00A0capabilities for our future success. During 2020, we held virtual/uni00A0workshops with this group on positive resilience, creating psychological safety and sustaining team engagement in a remote setting. For the SMTs, we held culture workshops to mobilise teams around our shared purpose and to deepen trust and collaboration. We/uni00A0also provided a new performance coaching programme for 120 of/uni00A0these leaders to specifically develop their coaching skills for remote settings, to help them better engage and empower their teams.\n\nWe have focused on capability building within our key talent pools. We/uni00A0conduct an annual talent review and identify successors for executive and senior leadership roles. To support this, during 2020 we/uni00A0defined critical success profiles for senior leader roles. These were used to design our new Executive Development Centre, which will specifically target the business unit CEO pipeline. The critical success profiles have also been used to adapt our existing assessment centres across our talent pipeline.\n\nFor those identified as our most strategic talent pool, typically those who are currently SMT and have potential to grow to larger roles and be successors to our Group Executive Committee roles within five years, we have focused on ensuring they have exposure to Group strategic projects and expanded role responsibilities, and are provided with specific, tailored development interventions, where appropriate.",

        "page_content": "In January 2021, we launched a three-year Sponsorship Programme matching our most senior leaders to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, identified through our talent review process, enabling a more diverse talent pipeline to gain visibility and be considered for stretch opportunities and roles. During/uni00A02021, we also plan to provide an experiential culture leadership journey to around 200 of our senior leaders, with the aim of developing the behaviours needed to help build an inclusive culture and to create a/uni00A0space where our values can be actively demonstrated by everyone.\n\nWe have also taken steps to deepen our functional talent pipeline and to accelerate the development of potential successors. Actions taken include the creation of a CFO development programme to accelerate identified business unit CFO successors and the provision of role expansion and enrichment opportunities for senior leaders in Group Digital. Jackson has focused on ongoing leadership capability assessments for its identified successors and high-potential population.\n\nWhere internal successors are not apparent, we aim to attract and retain the best talent across industries, irrespective of generation, culture or gender. We have further adapted our hiring practices to minimise unintentional systematic bias. Practices such as artificial intelligence-assisted job description/advertisements, use of psychometrics to evaluate fit to purpose and values, criterion-based interview methods with diverse panels, and a diverse candidate slate have all been introduced in key markets with wider roll-out through the/uni00A0introduction of our Recruitment Policy in early 2021.\n\nWe have continued to support and encourage mobility in our organisation to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experience. Notwithstanding challenges from Covid-19, more than 100 people moved between our businesses in 2020. Specifically in our insurance growth markets, where this is a strategic priority, we held a virtual talent expo to introduce each business and its job opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we will focus on continuing to broaden our talent pipeline and/uni00A0on building an environment where talent can most easily access the opportunities that match their aspirations. With increasing digitalisation and the need for digital skillsets and capabilities, we are/uni00A0providing our people with comprehensive training and learning opportunities to help them upskill, cross skill, and even reskill themselves to maximise their potential.\n\n## Performance and reward\n\nWe structure our reward arrangements to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre people. Our people contribute to the success of the Group/uni00A0and are rewarded accordingly. We recognise and reward high/uni00A0performance and are committed to a fair and transparent system of reward. Among our benefits, we offer employees competitive pension arrangements.\n\nOur UK business, Prudential Services Limited, has recently reported its 2020 UK Gender Pay Gap data and details can be found on the Group's website (www.prudentialplc.com/esg). Three of the four gender pay gap figures have increased in 2020, largely driven by the demerger of M&G plc, which saw a number of women in senior roles transfer to M&G. The pay gap remains volatile year-on-year due to the small number of colleagues employed by Prudential Services Limited, which makes the calculation sensitive to any changes in roles. While female representation in our leadership roles has increased from 25 per cent in 2017 to 33 per cent in 2020 in our London Head Office, the continuing pay gap reflects the/uni00A0fact that we have more men than women in leadership roles.\n\nRemuneration is linked to the delivery of business goals, our values and/uni00A0expected behaviours. We ensure that our rewards for our people do not incentivise inappropriate risk-taking by assessing employees on/uni00A0'what' they have achieved, and on 'how' they have done so.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCase study\n\n## Supporting our people through Covid-19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded at different times and/uni00A0with varying levels of impact across our markets, all parts of the business were devoted to/uni00A0ensuring the physical, emotional and social health and safety of our people, taking into account employee preferences during this time. Almost all employees spent at least part of 2020 working remotely, in line with local restrictions and guidance. Asia has established a/uni00A0mental health strategy, emphasising virtual connections, as/uni00A0well as community engagement as/uni00A0part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Jackson and our London office have offered regular sessions on different aspects of wellbeing and stress management. To coincide with World Mental Health day, we held our first global wellbeing day in October. This consisted of a series of online sessions across all time zones, including a/uni00A0session in which our leaders shared their own stories about mental health challenges they have faced. The Board has received regular updates from management on how our people have been supported. Beyond this, it is essential that the Group reacts to the trends in workforce expectations that have been intensified and accelerated by the pandemic, particularly around new and more flexible ways of working. Each business is exploring how we can meet the expectations of existing and future staff about flexibility around schedules and location.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "The Jackson High Five Recognition Program enables individuals to/uni00A0recognise their colleagues in areas of creativity, empowerment, execution, impact, investment in relationships and respect. In our London office, Angel Court, the Prudential Stars awards enable individuals to nominate colleagues, recognising examples of exceptional contributions, specifically in the areas of delivering synergy, adding value, fostering innovation, demonstrating stakeholder focus and maintaining risk awareness.\n\nWe are committed to paying the London Living Wage to permanent and temporary employees, and to contractors who regularly work at our premises in the UK. We also believe in the importance of giving employees the opportunity to benefit from the Group's success through share ownership, and operate share plans for employees in the UK and Asia. This includes the award-winning PruSharePlus plan, which enables employees in Asia to share in the longer-term success of/uni00A0the business and actively encourages share ownership and engagement. Similar all-employee share plans operate in the UK.\n\n## Executive remuneration\n\nThe Group's executive remuneration arrangements reward the achievement of Group, business, functional and personal targets, provided that performance is aligned to the Group's risk framework and appetite and that our conduct expectations, as well as those of our regulators and other stakeholders, are met. Extensive information on executive remuneration is provided into the Directors' remuneration report within the Annual Report.\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Executive Directors agreed to/uni00A0voluntarily forgo their 2020 salary increases. On 1 April 2020, Executive Directors' salaries were reduced to their December 2019 level. In May 2020, Executive Directors' pension benefits were reduced from 25 per cent of salary to 13 per cent of salary, aligning Executive Directors with the employer pension contribution available to the UK-based workforce.\n\nAs part of the three-year cycle, we presented an updated Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2020 Annual General Meeting and received the support of 95.8 per cent of shareholders in a binding vote.\n\nIn order to strengthen the community of interest between executives and other shareholders, remuneration is linked to sustained performance over the longer term. For example, 40 per cent of Executive Directors' bonus is deferred in shares for three years. Executive Directors are required to meet shareholding guidelines and/uni00A0a two-year holding period applies to long-term incentive awards in/uni00A0addition to the three-year performance period. The 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy requires departing Executive Directors to retain a/uni00A0substantial interest in the Company's shares for two years after they leave the Board.\n\nTo further increase transparency of executive remuneration and its alignment with the pay of other employees, we published our CEO pay ratio one year in advance of the disclosure becoming a requirement under the UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 in the 2018 Directors' remuneration report. Further information on our CEO pay ratio is detailed in the Directors' remuneration report within the Annual Report.\n\n## Digital responsibility\n\nDigital innovation is central to our aim of helping our customers to/uni00A0be/uni00A0healthier and wealthier. We are ambitious and we act with integrity with regards to digital responsibility. We are resolute in our/uni00A0commitment to fairness, safety and transparency in the design, governance and operation of our digital ecosystem.\n\n## Digital responsibility and Pulse\n\nWe are committed to providing robust security protection over both our Pulse app and customer data. Using the Monetary Authority of Singapore's regulations as a leading standard, we have developed a master set of security controls, from which the core security features have been integrated into our Pulse app. These include multi-factor authentication as part of the device registration process, mandating minimum mobile device operating systems versions, prevention of/uni00A0jailbroken and rooted devices from using Pulse, and the secure transmission and storage of data.\n\nOur Pulse ecosystem relies on partnerships with a range of third parties. All business partners we engage go through a detailed due diligence process to ensure that they meet our high standards on data/uni00A0security and protection requirements. We conduct information security and privacy impact assessments as part of the third-party management process to ensure that robust security and privacy controls are in place for all of our ecosystem partnership engagements.\n\nTo align the range of regulatory expectations and requirements across/uni00A0our businesses relating to customer privacy, we have developed/uni00A0the OnePulse Privacy Framework (OPF) to standardise the/uni00A0implementation of privacy controls. Referencing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements, the OPF outlines the mandatory and/uni00A0configurable controls to be built into our Pulse app, covering data subject rights, customer consent and privacy notices. More information about our approach to privacy is available below.\n\nData within our digital ecosystem is treated the same as all data in our organisation and is governed by the Group-wide Information Security Policy and Group-wide Privacy Policy. Pulse collects information about users in order to provide relevant services to them, which includes contact details, facial recognition information for log-in and fitness information from the user's wearable devices. Health-related information is collected by our health partners (such as Babylon) directly and Prudential will only receive a user's health information from our health partners with the user's explicit consent. All information collected is transparent to the user through the Privacy Notice provided to them before user registration.\n\n## Information security\n\nInformation security is rated as a principal risk in our business, demonstrating our continued commitment to securely managing the/uni00A0information our customers entrust to us.\n\nDuring 2020 we embedded a single Group-wide information security/uni00A0team leveraging skills, experience and resource globally via/uni00A0a/uni00A0'centres of excellence' model. This new model supported increased collaboration and sharing of skills across the whole Group.\n\nThe global model has allowed us to consolidate and rationalise information security technologies and processes across the Group, enabling security services to become more consistent and effective. This is critical to our business as it ensures the appropriate assessment, management and assurance of all third parties with the potential to manage or impact Prudential Group data or systems.",

The policy is mapped to numerous international and local/uni00A0standards including:\n\n- -ISO27002;\n- -NIST Cyber Security Framework;\n- -The New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation;\n- -The Monetary Authority of Singapore Guidelines on Technology Risk Management;\n- -The Hong Kong Insurance Authority Guideline on Cybersecurity; and\n- -The Bank Negara Malaysia Risk Management in Technology Standard.\n\nThis supports our global approach to security and our commitment to/uni00A0protecting the data entrusted to us by customers across our global footprint. The policy is also supported by a suite of technical standards. Our Security function retains its overarching commitment to protect the business, comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and support the growth of the Group securely.\n\n## Oversight and governance of information security\n\nThe Group-wide Information Security and Privacy Committee defines and provides governance and the risk management framework for information security risks across the Group. This Committee meets at/uni00A0least quarterly and is a sub-committee of the Group Executive Risk/uni00A0Committee (GERC), chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer.\n\nAs a standing member of the GERC, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) provides regular updates to the GERC and the Group Risk Committee on the cyber threats facing Prudential and the progress of Prudential's security programme. On a half-yearly basis, the Group CISO also holds a dedicated session with the Group Risk Committee to enable a more in-depth discussion on the cyber risk facing Prudential.\n\n## Our Group-wide framework for information security\n\nThe Group-wide framework for information security rests on four key/uni00A0tenets to defend and protect the Group, our information and our/uni00A0customers' data. These are 1) automation, 2) Global Security Operations Centre, 3) accelerate development of people skills and 4)/uni00A0continuous improvement.\n\nCase study\n\n## Response to challenges posed by Covid-19\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a large-scale move to/uni00A0remote working, significantly changing the working culture for/uni00A0staff and agents, as well as the way we engage with customers. In/uni00A0response to these new ways of working, we scaled up secure remote access, including VPN services, in/uni00A0the early stages of the/uni00A0pandemic. Additionally, Prudential has leveraged existing collaboration toolsets and capabilities, which have been integrated/uni00A0with security services to enable more secure and efficient team working.\n\nAs part of the change to remote working practices, Prudential undertook a reassessment of all employee laptops to ensure that secure remote working software had been correctly deployed and configured. In addition, the assessment reviewed and ensured that all laptops are protected against known vulnerabilities, and a more stringent approach for remote access has been adopted. During 2020, phishing campaign frequency was increased to monthly. Simulated phishing emails are tailored within regions and the sophistication of the techniques varies to ensure that staff are/uni00A0continually challenged to learn. The results of these campaigns and training completion rates are tracked across the Group to ensure that this remains an area of focus.\n\n## 1. Automation\n\nAutomation allows us to increase the speed and scale of our defences and reduce the need for human interaction in a number of incident types. This frees our team to focus on more challenging initiatives and/uni00A0on continuously maturing our security and privacy disciplines.\n\nThroughout 2020 we have continued to focus on automating security services to increase effectiveness and consistency and create efficiencies. As part of our approach to continuously integrate and deploy new tools into our Pulse ecosystem, we have introduced automated security testing toolsets. These help to ensure that security is integrated into the development life cycle from the beginning of the/uni00A0process, providing early feedback about any vulnerabilities.\n\n## 2. Global Security Operations Centre (SOC)\n\nA global SOC is in place to provide 24-hour threat and incident management and provides consistent, appropriate 24-hour support to/uni00A0our global businesses in the case of any suspicious event.\n\nWe retain membership of various intelligence-sharing networks, such/uni00A0as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis/uni00A0Centre, and maintain industry relationships to support intelligence-sharing through our network of connections.\n\nThe function of the Cyber Threat/uni00A0Intelligence team is to assist our teams and businesses in understanding the cyber threats we face and/uni00A0to focus on providing actionable intelligence. The ultimate goal of/uni00A0the intelligence provided is/uni00A0to guide our decisions to ensure the most/uni00A0relevant and impactful risks/uni00A0for our business are addressed.\n\n## 3. Accelerate development of people skills\n\nOur staff are critical to protecting the information entrusted to us by our customers. Consequently, information security awareness training is an integral component in ensuring that our information and systems\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Training is provided locally to support local languages and reflect any local regulatory and legal requirements, and completion is tracked within each business. The artificial intelligence skills of our digital security team are assessed and further development opportunities are/uni00A0provided to them.\n\nWe have rolled out a programme across the Group to support information security staff through Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) training and accreditation. The CISSP is/uni00A0one of the most highly regarded professional accreditations for information security worldwide and covers a broad scope of security domains. The programme began in Jackson and has now been extended across the Group-wide Information Security team, with over 40 members of the full-time security team across the Group holding the CISSP certification.\n\nThroughout the year our Non-executive Directors have access to one-to-one training, often delivered by the Group CISO, on topics including cyber threats and privacy. This ensures that they can not only protect themselves and the information they handle on a daily basis, but also engage in Board-level oversight of information security risks from a more informed and confident position, something we consider to be essential to the oversight of our strategy and risk management.\n\n- 4.  Continuous improvement Given the rapid evolution of threats, the security and privacy disciplines need to be in a state of continuous improvement across the/uni00A0three dimensions of people, process and technology. The model to/uni00A0measure the maturity of our security and privacy programme has been completed, with progress being made on rationalisation and optimisation of technology solutions.\n\nThe success of our information security programme is measured from both an internal and external perspective. Externally, benchmarking is conducted regularly to ensure that Prudential's cyber security maturity level is above the industry, and internally we assess the organisation's compliance level against the defined security controls as per our Group Information Security Policy and Group Privacy Policy and relevant standards. Security metrics, which measure the level of robustness of our security controls, are generated on a monthly basis to enable the organisation to respond and adapt to any potential adverse changes in our security position.\n\n## Incident response and resilience\n\nWhile our aim at Prudential is always to prevent incidents wherever possible, we must ensure that we are prepared to respond to any incident in a timely and effective manner. Incident response plans are/uni00A0developed, maintained and tested regularly, and the Group Information Security & Privacy team maintains a close working relationship with the business continuity and disaster recovery teams to ensure alignment of plans and support in the event of an incident. Regular scenario-based testing of these processes serves both to confirm the effectiveness of the plans and provide assurance that staff, including senior executives, are prepared for such an event.\n\n## Privacy\n\nIn 2020, a key focus was on driving consistency of approach to the management of data privacy issues in order to embed high standards across the Group and ensure compliance with the Group Privacy Policy. This was supported by the roll-out of a global privacy management platform across the Group to assist with management of/uni00A0privacy activities and to automate privacy control assessments where possible. Activities also took place to enhance and embed processes to/uni00A0ensure compliance with regional and local privacy requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which/uni00A0took effect on 1 January 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Group Privacy Office continues to maintain oversight of privacy compliance. The office works with our businesses across Asia, Africa and the US to support and advise on ongoing privacy compliance as well as to provide a point of escalation for resolving data privacy issues. Privacy is integrated within the Group-wide Information Security & Privacy team, which reports to the Group CISO, giving coverage of each region and the different countries in which Prudential operates.\n\n## AI ethics and governance\n\nWhile the use of artificial intelligence (AI) could bring tremendous benefits, we are aware of the potential risks in deploying AI. Our/uni00A0Global AI Council, chaired by the Group Chief Digital Officer, is responsible for oversight of AI tools and their implementation in our business. The Global AI Council meets quarterly and includes a number of working groups, which review all projects incorporating AI and machine learning across our business units before they receive approval.\n\nDuring 2020, we developed a set of AI Ethics Principles, reviewed by/uni00A0the Global AI Council. The principles were approved by the Group/uni00A0Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, which retains ultimate responsibility for setting the Group's ethical standards. These principles sit alongside our Group Code of Business Conduct and set/uni00A0out the standards expected of our colleagues responsible for designing, developing and operating complex applications.\n\nThe principles are:\n\n- -Effectiveness and value - we design tools with a clearly defined purpose to deliver value for our stakeholders;\n- -Explainability and transparency - we are transparent that AI tools are used as part of our products and services and explain this simply;\n- -Bias and fairness - we ensure that AI treats people fairly to avoid bias and unfair discrimination;\n- -Robustness - we design AI tools that are highly reliable and robust;\n- -Compliance - we comply and respect relevant regulations, including human rights laws;\n- -Accountability and responsibility - we accept accountability and/uni00A0responsibility for the outcome of the use of AI tools;\n- -Privacy and security - we respect user privacy and security; and\n- -Assurance - we continuously review and monitor our AI deployment and outcomes to ensure that these principles are met.\n\nThe Global AI Council is supported by six working groups:\n\n- 1.   Products and pricing - to drive the automation of actuarial work;\n- 2.   People - to upskill and certify the AI capabilities of all Prudential employees;\n- 3.   Data - to align with Prudential's data governance and management;\n- 4.   Technology and platform - to review and approve AI technology and supplier choices;\n- 5.   IP - to safeguard Prudential's AI intellectual property; and\n- 6.   Ethics - to approve AI prototypes for compliance with Prudential's AI Ethics Principles.\n\nAs we invest in AI, big data and other technologies to deliver on our purpose, we are providing everyone in the organisation, regardless of their roles, with opportunities to learn more about these technologies, so that they can participate and contribute to helping our customers. For those who want to advance further, we have created an AI Bootcamp, consisting of a five-level certification process, which covers advanced AI, machine learning, data analytics, as well as AI use in healthcare and finance. An overarching theme of the bootcamp is AI/uni00A0for good and helping families and communities in need.",

We seek to apply ESG considerations more broadly in our investment decisions and our fiduciary and stewardship duties, including ensuring that our investment decisions are aligned with our values around diversity and support our primary focus on healthy lives.\n\n## Governance\n\nAs with other ESG matters, responsible investment activity is overseen by the Group ESG Committee. More information on the Group ESG Committee is provided in the report introduction.\n\nOperational responsibility for responsible investment activity is delegated to the Group Responsible Investment Advisory Committee (GRIAC). The GRIAC is constituted as a sub-committee of the Group ESG Committee and provides a forum for Group and business units to consider responsible investment approaches. The GRIAC is co-chaired by Prudential Corporation Asia's Chief Investment Officer, Insurance Investment and Co-CIO, Eastspring, respectively senior executives within our main asset owner and asset management businesses.

        "page_content": "Case study\n\n## ESG integration case study: Multinational car company challenged to meet new regulations\n\n## ESG consideration\n\nDuring the review of a multinational automotive corporation headquartered in Europe, PPM's research analyst noted concerns about the company's ability to meet European carbon dioxide emission standards, which could lead to meaningful regulatory fines and negative consumer views given the increasingly environmentally conscious consumer. Despite what PPM believed was a solid company balance sheet (strong net industrial cash position and significant gross liquidity), its analyst viewed the company as behind other automotive corporations in its investment in and development of electric vehicles.\n\n## PPM analysis\n\nElectric vehicle penetration gained momentum in early 2020 at the onset of Europe's tougher emissions rules. Effective 1 January 2020, the rules imposed more stringent targets for passenger cars and vans - based upon average fleet-wide carbon dioxide emissions (g/km).\n\nPPM's research team discussed the issue in detail during an investment grade review of the automotive industry that assessed the company's positioning among its peers. The research revealed that the company had one of the largest percentage gaps in reducing its year-on-year average fleet-wide carbon dioxide emissions versus its peers and was at the most risk of not meeting standards. While the potential monetary fines were viewed as manageable, the company would be required to undertake significant investment in research and development to catch up with the leaders in the industry, or risk losing meaningful market share.\n\n## Outcome\n\nConsidering all factors related to the risk and return of the company, the changes to regulations, and the company's progress in developing electric vehicles and increasing its mix to meet emissions standards, PPM downgraded its internal rating. Its analysts will continue to monitor the company's improvements toward emissions goals alongside company fundamentals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG integration\n\nWe seek to integrate ESG factors into our investment decisions, alongside traditional financial analysis, to better manage risk and generate sustainable, long-term returns for our customers.\n\nWithin Eastspring, the Singapore-based equity team focuses on exploiting opportunities where risk perceptions and expectations have become misaligned. ESG issues are incorporated into the fundamental analysis and decision-making process to the extent that the team believe they could have a material impact on a company's valuation and financial performance. Similarly, for the fixed income team, only ESG issues that are material to the issuer's credit fundamentals and the valuation of the bond are factored into the analysis. For both equity and fixed income, companies are not excluded solely on perceived ESG issues.\n\nThis approach to integrate only material ESG factors into investment decision making does not preclude investment in sustainable investment opportunities. For example, in August 2020 Eastspring invested THB 1 billion ($30 million) in the Thai government's inaugural THB 30 billion sustainability bond. The bond carries a 15-year maturity, with proceeds divided between a project to expand the Mass/uni00A0Rail Transit System and to support various expenditures under the government's Covid-19 Rehabilitation Package.\n\nPPM follows a broadly similar approach to Eastspring. ESG factors are incorporated into the investment process where it is believed they may have a material impact on the financial performance of the investment. Investments are not automatically excluded at strategy or fund level on ESG grounds. Rather, the manager works with clients, who will specify exclusion lists unique to their ESG values and requirements.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Stewardship and engagement\n\nAs custodians of our customers' assets, it is important that we act in/uni00A0ways consistent with our stewardship responsibilities. This means seeking to maximise the long-term capital growth of the assets entrusted to us, while remaining accountable to our customers for our/uni00A0actions and being aware of our duty to uphold their best interests when carrying out investment activities. We aim to meet these requirements in several ways, including:\n\n- -Pursuing an active investment policy that aligns engagement activity with the long-term investment thesis to hold the asset in/uni00A0t h e/uni00A0p or t folio;\n- -Treating shareholder voting rights as a valuable asset and seeking to vote all holdings;\n- -Developing and adhering to principles of conduct governing our stewardship activities, including the fiduciary relationship with customers; and\n- -Ensuring that our approach to stewardship is aligned to best practice. Notably, Eastspring is a member of International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) and its stewardship approach is aligned with the ICGN Global Stewardship Principles and ICGN Global Governance Principles. It is also a member of the Asian Corporate Governance Network, which seeks to promote high standards of corporate governance across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n## Engagement\n\nEngagement is a core part of providing effective stewardship and an important means of generating long-term value. We seek to encourage business and management practices that support sustainable financial performance through constructive interaction, based on our in-depth knowledge of the companies and their business environment.\n\nOur approaches to engagement vary across our asset owner and asset/uni00A0manager businesses, reflecting differences in local investment practices and norms, and consistent with the Group's principles-based framework to coordinate its responsible investment activities. However, within this broad framework, some common principles and/uni00A0practices apply. These include: that engagement is an important way to identify material risks and opportunities to investment; that maintaining a continuing and open dialogue with management is key to/uni00A0building relationships, and thus effective influence; and, that collaboration with other investors (through bodies such as Climate Action 100+ or the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC)) is/uni00A0a helpful way to amplify the effectiveness of our engagement activity on ESG issues. The use of voting rights is also an important means to/uni00A0signal investor preferences to company management and it is the Group's policy to vote on their holdings (see Proxy voting below).\n\nThe level of conviction to hold a particular investment can be impacted by the results of engagement. Where conviction levels fall below an appropriate level, the position may be divested. This was the case, for/uni00A0example, with a recent engagement by Eastspring with a company providing education services. During our engagements, the company did respond with some improvement to their initial proposed corporate governance. However we did not have a sufficient level of confidence in the standard of governance or controls in place to avoid future contentious proposals. Given the lower level of conviction around the range of potential outcomes we felt there was insufficient valuation support to compensate for observed risks and Eastspring exited the/uni00A0position.\n\nBoth Eastspring and PPM undertake company engagements focused on both financial and non-financial matters on an annual basis. With/uni00A0respect to specific engagements related to material ESG issues, Eastspring's equity and fixed income teams have conducted over 300/uni00A0unique engagements in 2020, in addition to engagement on financial issues with companies.\n\n## Proxy voting\n\nAlongside engagement, voting is considered part of the investment process and the pathway to value realisation. It is therefore integral to our stewardship responsibilities. By exercising our votes, we seek both to add value and to protect our interests as shareholders. We consider the issues, meet company management if necessary and vote accordingly. Where possible, we seek to discuss any contentious resolutions with investee companies before casting our votes in order to ensure that our objectives are understood, and our votes will be cast in the best interests of our investors and clients.\n\nWhere appropriate, we use third-party investment advisers to aid the process of making proxy voting decisions. Both Eastspring and PPM engage Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a fellow signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), to provide administrative assistance in connection with voting/uni00A0proxies.\n\nThe policies and guidelines of the proxy advisers are periodically reviewed to understand the nature of their recommendations and test their compatibility with our requirements. However, specific policies and advice from the proxy adviser are not applied mechanically. We always apply our judgement and decide how to vote on each resolution on its merits in the context of the principles of our proxy policy.\n\nIn Asian and emerging markets, proxy voting activity is commonly focused on governance matters, with fewer shareholder resolutions focused on environmental or social matters. However, our equity team actively vote and take any material ESG issues that have been identified into consideration.\n\nWhile our equity teams are typically supportive of company management, where applicable we use proxy voting actively to signal to management our expectations for improvement in behaviours.\n\nIn 2020, Eastspring voted on 99.63 per cent of the total number of proxy votes in which it was eligible to vote. Eastspring voted with management recommendations 90.33 per cent of the time and voted against management recommendations 9.67 per cent of the time. Please refer to Eastspring's website for more information on its proxy voting record www.eastspring.com/about-us/responsible-investment.\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Often, the engagements span more than one ESG dimension, and where this is/uni00A0the/uni00A0situation, the case study is allocated to the ESG category on the basis of a judgement as to which dimension is more material.\n\n## Environmental\n\nCase studies\n\n## Global Emerging Markets Equity Team, Singapore: Environmental engagement\n\nCompany A, a Korean power company, is a valuation outlier and has/uni00A0been a long-term holding, with which we have maintained ongoing engagement.\n\nObjective: Our engagement is aimed at understanding its long-term strategy around transition to a low-carbon economy, to/uni00A0enable us to perform our fiduciary duties and decisions around proxy voting from a well-informed position.\n\nScope: In 2020, we engaged with Company A in a discussion about/uni00A0the company's long-term strategy for dealing with carbon emissions. It shared that it has a long-term plan to increase renewable energy and to reduce dependence on coal-fired power generation. We/uni00A0discussed the future of the power company's overseas coal power projects and its commitment in October 2020 to not build any/uni00A0overseas coal plants going forward, but only energy-efficient, renewable-type plants. This is aligned with its commitments to grow/uni00A0renewable energy domestically, add no new coal power plants, start to close coal-fired capacity, and to invest in/uni00A0technology to reduce carbon emissions. Notably, the company's overseas coal project plants in South Africa and the Philippines are being converted to liquefied natural gas (LNG) or terminated.\n\nSubsequently, we engaged with the company on its anti-corruption policies. In response to corruption issues, it has responded by putting in place governance structures that include enhanced processes, training and monitoring.\n\nOutcomes: Demonstrating a response through restructuring and capital allocation towards renewable energy, and improvement to/uni00A0governance structures.\n\n## Japan Equity Team, Singapore\n\nCompany B is one of the world's largest steel producers.\n\nObjective: Our ongoing engagement since 2017 is aimed at understanding the company's position on three key issues: carbon/uni00A0emissions and energy usage (including disclosure policies), board governance and structure, and workplace safety.\n\nProcess: In 2020, our three engagement meetings focused on potential structural change in the industry and the need to reduce capacity, and progress in implementing new (hydrogen-based) steel-making technologies. The team also discussed the potential impact of recent regulation by the Japanese government aimed at reducing coal-fired power generation capacity. The engagement was/uni00A0also undertaken in fulfilment of our obligations as a member of/uni00A0the Climate Action 100+.\n\nOutcome: We observed that management was making good progress towards finalising specific medium and long-term climate/uni00A0change targets, as part of the ultimate target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. In terms of board governance and structure, the/uni00A0company sought and received approval from shareholders in/uni00A0June 2020 to transition its governance model. The/uni00A0dialogue has supported the case for continued investment in/uni00A0the company.\n\n## Social (labour rights, health and safety)\n\nCase study\n\n## Malaysian Equity Team, Malaysia\n\nCompany C is a large global glove manufacturer.\n\nObjective: To determine whether the company was putting processes in place to improve labour practices.\n\nProcess: In June, we engaged with Company C following allegations of forced labour practices from a UK Channel 4 report. We noted that these allegations, which were brought up in December 2018, had resurfaced and that the company had made progress in rectifying these claims.\n\nIn July, we sought further clarification from management when the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by some of the company's subsidiaries. Management shared that they had remedied some of/uni00A0the key issues, such as retention of identification documents, and/uni00A0were looking into the reimbursement of recruitment fees.\n\nWe engaged again in November, following an accident that resulted in the amputation of a worker's arm. The purpose of this engagement was to remind the company to take remedial actions to keep workers safe and close gaps that may contribute to accidents. Subsequently, it was uncovered that the worker had not followed the company's standard operating procedure, which the company will investigate remedying with extensive education. It has continued to improve its training programmes by adding training in/uni00A0native languages, revamping on-site training to include accident-prone areas, and increasing training hours.\n\nOutcome: While we recognised that the company had made significant improvement in labour market practices, we continue to/uni00A0stress to management that, as one of the largest glove manufacturers in the world, it needs to set better standards and/uni00A0be/uni00A0vigilant about ESG issues, and we will continue to engage with it/uni00A0on labour issues into 2021.",

We also highlighted the need for improvements in board structure and function and the nominations and succession process.\n\nWe continued our engagement in July, when we conducted a discussion of the ongoing evolution of its governance structure and/uni00A0approach and its oversight and management ownership of ESG-related matters. In our ongoing engagements, we have noted that the company's board and broader governance structures have/uni00A0shown a significant step forward (eg improving board independence, voluntary committee structure).\n\nThe company has noted that these changes are, partially, in/uni00A0response to our ongoing engagement. It also detailed its increased focus on ESG with a new ESG committee that reports directly to the board. We were satisfied that ESG governance and management ownership appear to be improving.\n\nBeyond this progress, however, we have also discussed that we would like to see continued progress in terms of board independence, diversity, and change to an independent committee system.\n\nOutcome: Gained clarity on timeline for implementing PRI framework and the company's efforts on ESG.\n\n## Japan Equity Team, Singapore\n\nCompany E is a credit card issuer and transaction processing company.\n\nProxy Voting Objective: Proxy vote signals the accountability of/uni00A0chairman and CEO for the delivery of poor longer-term returns.\n\nProcess: The current chairman has been both chairman and CEO since 2000. Over this period return on equity (ROE) has been weak and has further deteriorated over the past three years. Although the company's management did seek to buy back some shares, we/uni00A0did not feel this was sufficient to address the issue. We felt a clear strategy needed to be articulated to grow the business, amid/uni00A0fierce competition from other traditional credit card players and new cashless players.\n\nA vote was due to be held at the company AGM to re-elect the/uni00A0chairman (and other directors). While our proxy adviser recommendation, and company management vote was 'For' the/uni00A0re-election of the Chairman, we decided to vote 'Against' re-election on the basis of his accountability for the poor historic performance of the company.\n\nOutcome: In addition to acknowledging the company's historic delivery of poor trend returns, our analysis suggests the company has a/uni00A0good platform and there is sufficient valuation upside to support our level of conviction around the overall governance of the company. However, our vote 'Against' the re-election of the chairman signals our position in relation to accountability for historic performance and the need for a change in leadership to support a/uni00A0clear strategy for growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capacity building, collaboration and industry and regulatory engagement\n\nWe continue to seek opportunities to build capacity and enhance capabilities within our responsible investment practices. In August 2020, Eastspring participated in a sustainability benchmarking process and capacity-building exercise with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), one of the world's largest independent environmental organisations. WWF works with industry associations, regulators, stock exchanges and investors in Asia to support ESG risk analysis and opportunity identification. The benchmarking process is being used as/uni00A0an enabler to further embed sustainability into the business and is aligned with the Group's strategic focus areas. As part of an ongoing focus on continuous improvement to meet our sustainability ambitions, Eastspring has incorporated actions from the benchmarking exercise into four sustainability work streams focused around purpose, governance, climate strategy and responsible investment. Eastspring also participated in the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) Climate Change Training Project Advisory Committee, the/uni00A0region's first accredited climate change training.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nWe continue to view collaboration with investors through collective initiatives and industry bodies as another way to build capacity and to amplify the effectiveness of our engagement activity. Two examples of collective bodies in which we participate are Climate Action 100+ and the AIGCC. Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative to engage systemically important greenhouse gas emitters across the global economy. The AIGCC aims to raise awareness and encourage action among Asia's asset owners and financial institutions about the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and low-carbon investing. Where appropriate, some of our engagements are coordinated through these bodies.\n\nWe have aligned our responsible investment approach to industry best/uni00A0practice through our support for the United Nations Principles of/uni00A0Responsible Investment. Ninety-nine per cent of Prudential Hong Kong's investment portfolio is managed by asset managers that are PRI signatories. Prudential supports PPM's and Eastspring's membership as PRI signatories. Eastspring has been a PRI signatory since February 2018. In 2020, it submitted its first official PRI Report and achieved A+ scores across two categories and A scores across four categories, well above the median scores for the PRI's asset management signatories. An A+ score was achieved for Strategy and Governance and ESG Integration in Listed Equities modules; and an A rating was awarded for/uni00A0Listed Equities - Active Ownership, Fixed Income - SSA, Fixed Income - Corporate (Financial), and Fixed Income - Corporate (Non-Financial).\n\nPPM became a signatory in October 2018 and received an A score for its approach to Strategy and Governance, placing it among the top tier of asset managers in this category.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Therefore, we/uni00A0seek to engage with policy bodies and regulators in the markets in which we operate to both shape the debate and to align our approach to evolving best practice on the topic. Some examples of notable industry engagements and collaboration undertaken during 2020 are:\n\n| BU                                             | Theme                            | Regulatory/industry initiative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group (Prudential plc)                         | Global/regional initiatives      | At a Group level, our compliance and government relations functions  provide input to regulatory consultations and engage with  international bodies, such as the Sustainable Development Investment  Partnership (SDIP) - an initiative of the World Economic Forum (WEF)  - and the Institute of International Finance (IIF) that are active in setting  standards for responsible investment.

        "page_content": "## Product development and client engagement\n\nWe are continuing to expand our ESG offering to clients to meet the growing demand for responsible investment products in our markets. In December 2019, Eastspring launched the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund, which supports sustainable objectives, as well as meeting client needs for an ESG-themed investment product. Our Singapore and Hong Kong-based life businesses are anchor investors into the fund. While the fund's AUM remains modest at $73 million, during 2020 Eastspring continued to engage with interested gatekeepers from both/uni00A0retail and institutional investors on the Asia Sustainable Bond Fund strategy, as it builds its performance track record with a view to/uni00A0increasing third-party investment. The fund follows an absolutereturn targeting strategy and does not target a specific benchmark. Notwithstanding this, recent performance compares well with broadly similar indices, such as the JPMorgan Asia Credit - ESG Index.\n\nIn November 2020, Prudential Hong Kong, through its participating life fund, provided the cornerstone funding for a new ESG ETF provided by BlackRock through its iShares unit. The fund tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ESG Reduced Carbon Target Index, which reduces greenhouse gas emission intensity by 63 per cent and exposure to fossil fuel reserves by 95 per cent, relative to the parent benchmark.\n\nOther significant ESG-themed asset owner initiatives through 2020 include the adoption by Prudential Assurance Malaysia Berhad of sustainable investing strategies for local equity investment within its PRULink Strategic Fund, and the initiation of a project by PT Prudential Life Assurance (PLAI) to publish ESG scores for all its investmentlinked product (ILP) funds. PLAI is also in the process of changing the/uni00A0benchmark for one of its existing ILP funds to a new ESG index (the/uni00A0IDX ESG Leaders) developed by the Indonesia Stock Exchange.\n\n## Outlook for 2021 and next steps\n\nPrudential recognises that strengthening our approach to responsible investment is an ongoing and long-term process that we expect will evolve over time.\n\nFor 2021, as an asset owner, we expect to take further steps to expand and make more explicit our expectations of asset managers in the areas of ESG integration and engagement. The recent establishment of/uni00A0Eastspring Portfolio Advisers (EPA) will help to facilitate and implement our asset owner requirements with asset managers. EPA/uni00A0is/uni00A0our investment centre of excellence for tactical asset allocation, model portfolio construction, manager selection, liability-driven investments and solutions and derivative expertise. From an asset owner perspective, EPA will integrate ESG in all relevant processes within its remit. EPA's complete view of the asset owner portfolio will/uni00A0contribute to a holistic and coherent approach on ESG. The/uni00A0establishment of EPA has also created a platform where the asset/uni00A0owner and the asset manager can discuss, monitor and advance the ESG initiatives.\n\nAs well as these steps to improve the alignment of asset owner and asset manager objectives, we will continue to develop our overall approach by identifying and aligning with selected global standards and initiatives that help to frame and inform our principles-based approach to the impacts and opportunities of ESG. In this context, our/uni00A0Asian business is investigating becoming a PRI signatory as an asset owner in 2021.\n\nBy taking ESG issues into account, we can meet our clients' financial expectations, serve their other long-term interests and meet the expectations of society.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Strategic Enabler: Community engagement and investment\n\n## Our approach to community investment\n\nOur community investment strategy is closely aligned with our business purpose and with our stakeholders' concerns and interests. Our strategy is focused around health and resilience issues relevant to the communities in which we operate, education (particularly financial education) and building resilience across communities. This is underscored by a desire for strong employee engagement in the work we do. Our strong contribution continues to improve lives and build communities, wherever we work. Our relationships with our charity partners are long term, involving support through both funding and skills-based employee volunteering.\n\n## Governance of community investment\n\nOur businesses are guided by the framework for investing in the community, as laid out in our Group-wide Community Investment Policy and the Group's ESG strategy. Within that framework they have/uni00A0the autonomy to manage their own community investment programmes. For business units in Asia and Africa, Prudence Foundation, a unified charitable organisation governed by a statutory board of directors, provides regular review of strategy and spending for community investment, which maximises the impact in these regions. In the US, a governance committee of Jackson and the Jackson/uni00A0Charitable Foundation board of directors regularly reviews community investment activity, strategy and spend. Going forward, the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group will oversee our community engagement and investment activities on behalf of the/uni00A0Board.\n\nOur Group-wide Community Investment Policy sets minimum standards, as well as prohibiting political funding and contributions to/uni00A0religious organisations that have a clear aim to propagate a set faith. It is the Group's policy neither to make donations to political parties nor to incur political expenditure, within the meaning of those expressions as defined in the UK Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Group did not make any such donations or incur any such expenditure in 2020.\n\n## Monitoring and measuring community investment\n\nOur community investment performance metrics are aligned to the Business for Societal Impact (B4SI) Framework (formerly known as London Benchmarking Group), which is used to monitor progress and guide the valuation of both cash and in-kind contributions, employee volunteering and management costs.\n\nIn 2020, the Group spent $33.2 million (2019: $29.1 million) supporting community activities. Direct cash donations to charitable organisations amounted to $25 million (2019: $20.6 million). The balance includes in-kind donations, as set out on the Group website, calculated in accordance with Business for Societal Impact (B4SI) framework. The/uni00A0in-kind total includes 112,000 hours of colleague volunteer service\n\nfor our local communities. Our primary focus areas for community investment in 2020 were health, social and welfare issues, which together accounted for 46 per cent of investment in 2020; followed by/uni00A0education (20 per cent), environment (15 per cent) and emergency relief (7 per cent). In 2020, 63 per cent of our community investment activity was in Asia and Africa, and 35 per cent in the US. The remaining 2 per cent, attributed to London head office, includes both UK and global activity.\n\nOur 2020 community investment reporting is assured by Deloitte LLP. Further information and Deloitte's assurance statement can be found at www.prudentialplc.com/esg.\n\n## Covid-19 Relief Fund\n\nPrudential's flagship international volunteering programme, the Chairman's Challenge, has been bringing people together across the Group to help their communities since 2006. In 2020, the Chairman's Challenge joined forces with Prudential Corporation Asia to create a/uni00A0$2.5 million Group-wide Covid-19 Relief Fund. The fund was administered by Prudence Foundation, Prudential's community investment arm in Asia and Africa, and distributed to Prudential's markets around the world, allowing them flexibility to allocate funding based on local knowledge of community needs. Funds were used to support approved charitable and community projects tackling the immediate impact of the pandemic, and its social and economic consequences. Local businesses' programmes included supporting vulnerable communities with Covid-19 messaging, hygiene and sanitation, nutrition and educational programmes. For example:\n\n- - Prudential Thailand and Eastspring Thailand donated THB4.9 million (US$150,000) to four hospitals in November. The/uni00A0donation will contribute to the construction of airborne infectious isolation rooms and acute respiratory infection clinics in/uni00A0the four hospitals. Prudential Thailand also donated 2,500 face shields made by its employees to help protect medical professionals and frontline health workers.\n- -In the Philippines, the Covid-19 Relief Fund donated PhP5 million (US$100,000) to the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Medical Foundation Inc to support the University of the Philippines (UP)-PGH Covid-19 programme. PGH serves as one of the primary Covid-19 referral hospitals in the Philippines and its Covid-19 programme seeks to equip its healthcare workers with personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, goggles, face shields, and cover-all suits. It also provides medical equipment for cardiac and respiratory care to Covid-19 patients.\n- -Our Covid-19 Relief Fund was used in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to provide food to vulnerable communities and to deliver a three-month awareness and training programme with AGIS, an NGO, to at-risk areas. In/uni00A0Ghana the fund supported three programmes, including School for Languages, to provide Covid-19 materials and guidance in local Ghanaian languages, as much of the information on Covid-19 is provided in English. In Nigeria the Covid-19 Relief Fund supported a project with Slum2School, to engage 3,000 nursery, primary and secondary school learners between May and December across 20/uni00A0vulnerable communities.\n- -Jackson used the fund to support immediate community needs resulting from Covid-19. Jackson awarded $150,000 to non-profits across Chicago, Lansing and Nashville, providing direct financial assistance in tandem with long-term financial coaching and education to individuals and families impacted by the pandemic. This strategic approach provided immediate support for the most vulnerable while working toward a more secure financial future, core to both Jackson's philanthropic and business purposes.",

        "page_content": "In addition to the Covid-19 Relief fund, Prudential supported communities through other initiatives:\n\n- -With elderly people facing a higher risk from Covid-19 than the general population, Prudence Foundation partnered with HelpAge International. Prudence Foundation supported the production of two Safe Steps Elderly Care videos, which provided simple and clear guidelines to care-givers on how to protect older people in care homes, prevent infection and ensure appropriate measures for care-givers' health and safety. HelpAge is working with its network members in Asia alongside the care homes and local governments to disseminate these guidelines to over 1,200 recipients directly. The videos have been translated into five languages and a dedicated website was created to host the information and videos. The videos were available on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter during August 2020, reaching over 42,000 people.\n- -Jackson has also provided a total of $1.34 million in community grants to support non-profits, which are facing reduced fundraising/uni00A0revenue.\n- -Since April, Jackson wholesalers have conducted webinars where, for each adviser in attendance, a donation is made to the Feeding America Food Bank in the adviser's local community. Donations totalling $350,100 have been made to more than 100 different food/uni00A0banks across the country, meaning Jackson has helped to provide over 3.5 million meals. Jackson has also partnered with the/uni00A0Nashville Food Project, preparing 6,075 meals for at-risk youth in the underused corporate dining centre.\n\n## Financial education\n\nDeveloped by Prudential to address the gap in financial literacy for children, Cha-Ching is a global financial education and responsibility programme catering for children aged seven to 12 years old. Now in its/uni00A010th year, the programme continues to grow and expand across all our markets and is well received by educators, parents, children and government stakeholders. For more information on our approach to promoting financial literacy and how it supports making health and financial security more accessible, please see page 84.\n\n## Safety\n\n## Safe Steps\n\nSafe Steps is a campaign designed to provide key messaging and raise awareness on life-saving issues across our markets. It now covers disasters, road safety, first aid and Covid-19. Developed in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and NatGeo, it continues to reach millions of people in/uni00A0Asia and Africa via numerous media and government partnerships. The Safe Steps programmes have also been made available and shared on Prudential's Pulse super-app in Hong Kong and the Philippines, and/uni00A0through local television and media partnerships and government partnerships in Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam over the years.\n\nA new Safe Steps Covid-19 campaign was also developed in partnership with the IFRC and NatGeo and launched in March 2020, providing key educational messages and awareness on Covid-19. The/uni00A0campaign has been distributed throughout the year across Asia and Africa, leveraging the Safe Steps network.\n\nBuilding on the success of Safe Steps, in 2019 Prudence Foundation launched Safe Steps Kids, a partnership with the IFRC and Cartoon/uni00A0Network. This initiative uses popular cartoon characters to/uni00A0equip millions of children with actionable information to protect themselves and others in the event of emergencies or disaster situations. The programme has been leveraged by local national Red/uni00A0Cross societies in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines through school activities, reaching more than 2,500 students directly. In 2020, in view of the pandemic, Safe Steps Kids online activities have been organised by the Malaysia Red Crescent Society and Indonesian Red Cross Society.\n\nSafe Steps continues to have significant reach. For example:\n\n- -Safe Steps programmes continue to reach over 250 million people a/uni00A0day in Asia and 80 million people a month in Africa via media partnerships;\n- -Safe Steps Kids has a TV reach of 31 million households every day; and\n- -On social media, Safe Steps Kids has reached over 11 million viewers, and its videos have been viewed 3.1 million times across all/uni00A0digital platforms.\n\nSafe Steps Road Safety Africa was launched in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire at the end/uni00A0of 2019 and continues to be promoted across the continent via multimedia distribution on both regional and national TV networks. In/uni00A0December 2020, the campaign was launched in Zambia in partnership with the Road Traffic Safety Agency, the Red Cross and/uni00A0several media partners.\n\n## Safe Steps D-Tech Awards\n\nIn addition to providing life-saving information, Prudence Foundation launched the Disaster Tech (D-Tech) Innovation Programme in 2019. The objective of the programme is to find, fund and support innovative disaster tech solutions that could save lives in natural disaster events, and to catalyse innovation and increase investment and non-financial support through partnerships. The programme has been unified with the Safe Steps programme and relaunched as the Safe Steps D-Tech Awards. Efforts in 2020 have focused on preparing for the next competition to be held in 2021. The second edition of the awards launched in December 2020, inviting applicants across both profit and/uni00A0non-profit sectors. Finalists will be announced in June 2021 and will have the opportunity to receive grants from a pool of $200,000, as/uni00A0well as mentorship, technology support and access to investor networks. Our network of partners supporting the D-Tech Awards has/uni00A0grown to include humanitarian partner IFRC, technology partner Lenovo and strategic partners Antler, AVPN, National Geographic, e27, Give2Asia, Hatcher+, Jubilee Capital Management and Tech for Impact among others.\n\n## Disaster risk reduction in schools\n\nThe Comprehensive Safe Schools Framework (CSSF) is a globally recognised framework to ensure that all children are educated in a safe environment. At its core, the framework focuses on three key pillars - school infrastructure, school disaster management and disaster risk/uni00A0education, with an emphasis on disasters to which schools and communities may be exposed. Since 2013, Prudence Foundation has been supporting the implementation of Safe Schools in partnership with Save the Children and Plan International, which aims to address the objectives of the CSSF, as well as the objectives of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

In 2019 Prudence Foundation renewed its partnership with Plan International to roll out the programme across Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines between 2019 and 2022, aiming to reach a further 20,000 children and adults by/uni00A0the end of 2022.\n\nIn the Philippines, Prudence Foundation has partnered with Save the Children and the Philippines' Department of Education on a strategic initiative to develop a management information system for schools designed to reduce disaster risk, together with training and capacity building for teachers and local government officials. As of 2020, the/uni00A0project has successfully completed the build of a comprehensive Disaster Risk Reduction Management Information System (DRRMIS). The system is now being piloted in selected regions, with the eventual aim for a nationwide roll-out once the pilot is completed at the end of 2021, potentially benefiting over 20 million students and almost 47,000 schools nationwide. External consultants have also been engaged to conduct an independent evaluation of the programme, with the intent to share evidence-based impacts and build a case study for other governments to reduce disaster risk and replicate this approach across other countries.\n\n## Health\n\nA key area of focus for Prudence Foundation has been early childhood care and development. In 2020, Prudence Foundation entered a new partnership with UNICEF to implement a regional Early Childhood Development (ECD) programme. The programme focuses on developing a regional strategy to advance ECD aligned with the Nurturing Care Framework, and implementing an effective communication strategy to raise awareness around holistic nurturing care for children aged up to three years old. The communication strategy seeks to raise awareness and to provide essential knowledge and skills to parents and care-givers around holistic nurturing care for/uni00A0children aged from birth to three years old, which is of particular importance during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has adversely impacted young children. The programme will be piloted in Indonesia to reach 90,000 children and their parents or care-givers by the end of/uni00A02 021.\n\nPrudence Foundation has become a founding member of The China Children Development Fund, which aims to promote healthy and comprehensive child development in poor areas in China by supporting cross-disciplinary empirical research and translating the results into policies and practices. We also support two three-year ECD programmes in rural China under the China Development Research Foundation. REACH (Rural Education and Child Health) is/uni00A0a/uni00A0programme aimed at enhancing parental capabilities and behaviours as well as improving children's health with nutritional support. Under this programme over 1,500 children will be impacted. The second programme is a nutrition improvement programme, which/uni00A0focuses on improving the quality and standards of school nutrition in poverty-stricken areas.\n\n## Jackson's community investment approach\n\nJackson engages its colleagues and strengthens its links with local communities by providing grants, community sponsorships, donation matching and volunteering hours across Lansing, Chicago and Nashville, and nationally through the Jackson Charitable Foundation to/uni00A0increase financial education across the country.\n\n- -Lansing: In June, Jackson announced a $750,000 partnership with/uni00A0the Greater Lansing Food Bank to expand the food bank's warehouse. This campaign engaged more than 430 colleagues who/uni00A0personally donated to the project. The new warehouse doubled the square footage, allowing the campaign to increase overall distribution of food from 9 million meals annually to 18 million meals by 2025 and increase daily volunteers by 100 per cent.\n- -Nashville: On 3 March 2020, tornadoes caused devastation in communities across Greater Nashville, leaving 25 people dead and 309 injured, and destroying many homes and businesses. Jackson colleagues supported tornado relief efforts with supply collections, volunteer opportunities and matched funding donations to the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee's (CFMT) Emergency Response Fund. Colleagues contributed $19,620 and volunteered 181 hours towards relief efforts.\n- -Volunteering: In 2020, 848 Jackson associates volunteered, with the company contributing over 29,000 volunteer hours nationally. For the sixth time, Jackson was awarded the US President's Volunteer Service Award. This year, the recognition was elevated to the Gold level in recognition of completing 15,000 hours of volunteering with Junior Achievement during the 2018-2019 school/uni00A0year teaching financial education and work readiness.\n\n## London community investment activity\n\nPrudential RideLondon first took place in 2013, and has become the world's greatest festival of cycling, inspiring tens of thousands of people to take up the sport and raising over \u00a377 million for charity from/uni00A02013 to 2019. In 2020, the final year of Prudential's sponsorship, the event was replaced with a virtual event, My Prudential RideLondon, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 10,000 people signed up to/uni00A0take on a range of challenges both in the UK and across the world, with participants riding as far afield as the US, Brazil, Kenya, Japan and/uni00A0Australia, and \u00a33 million was raised for charity.\n\nIn 2020, Prudential's London Head Office agreed new three-year partnerships with four local charities supporting projects tackling homelessness, isolation and loneliness, mental health and social inclusion. Partnerships were established with The Connection at St/uni00A0Martin's; The Cares Family; Mind in the City, Hackney and Waltham Forest; and The Amos Bursary. The four charities were chosen by a panel of colleague volunteers and the projects are all closely aligned with our overall ESG strategy in helping to make health and financial security available to underserved communities.",

        "page_content": "Fighting financial crime\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6. Strategic Enabler: Good governance and responsible business practices\n\nStrong governance processes are the foundation of our business and critical to maintaining trust with stakeholders, particularly in the highly regulated financial markets within which we operate. Our governance framework is clear about our standards of behaviour and those standards flow into every part of what we do, including our financial performance and tax practices, as well as operating to mitigate financial crime and informing how we deal with our customers and suppliers. We also recognise the importance of reducing the direct impact of our own operations on the environment and see this as a non-negotiable responsible business practice.\n\n## Standards of conduct\n\nOur Group Code of Business Conduct sits at the heart of the Group Governance Manual, our internal governance framework that sets out the principles by which we conduct our business and ourselves. The Code highlights the ethical standards that the Board expects of itself, our employees, our agents and others working on behalf of the Group, and is supported by a set of Group-wide principles and values that define how the Group expects business to be conducted in order to/uni00A0achieve its strategic objectives. Our Group Governance Manual presents our Group-wide approach to governance, risk management and internal control, and is subject to regular review to ensure that we/uni00A0meet the expectations of our stakeholders. In 2020 the Group Governance Manual was updated to align with our post-demerger structure and revised operating model, and now serves as the single governance data source for all colleagues across the Group. Each business must certify annual compliance with the requirements set out/uni00A0in the Manual, including the Code, Delegated Authorities and Group-wide policies.\n\n## Tax strategy and reporting\n\nThe responsible and sustainable management of our tax affairs helps us to maintain constructive relations with our stakeholders and play a/uni00A0positive role in the economy and the wider communities in which we/uni00A0operate. In 2020 we made a total tax contribution of $2,114 million. This significant contribution plays an important part in helping the communities in which we operate to provide valuable public services and build infrastructure for the benefit of the wider community and the/uni00A0economy.\n\nWe understand the importance of paying the right amount of tax on/uni00A0time. We manage our tax affairs transparently and seek to build constructive relationships with tax authorities in all the countries in/uni00A0which we operate. Our Tax Risk Policy outlines our processes to/uni00A0identify, measure, control and report on tax risk, and is regularly reviewed and refreshed.\n\nOur tax strategy is published annually and complies with the mandatory requirements under the UK 2016 Finance Act, focusing on:\n\n- -Acting responsibly and taking an objective view in all our tax/uni00A0matters;\n- -Managing tax in line with our Group governance and risk management procedures; and\n- -Ensuring transparency and engagement with all our stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, our tax strategy document includes a number of additional disclosures, including a country-by-country disclosure of revenues, profits, average employee numbers and taxes for countries where more than $5 million tax was paid. Furthermore, we provide a breakdown of the types and amount of taxes we pay globally. This includes taxes borne and collected on employee income, such as social security. Our tax strategy document also provides more detail on what drives our tax payments and demonstrates that our tax footprint (ie/uni00A0where we pay taxes) remains consistent with our business and employee footprint.\n\nWe actively monitor developments in the tax transparency agenda and/uni00A0look to further develop the disclosure of meaningful tax information to help our various stakeholders' understanding of our tax footprint. We will be publishing our updated tax strategy, which will include more information on the tax we paid in 2020, how we manage our tax affairs and the governance and management of tax risk, by/uni00A031 May 2021.\n\nWe take the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, corruption and fraud seriously and are committed to implementing and maintaining industry-leading policies and standards.\n\nOur Group-wide financial crime policies were updated in 2020 to integrate Group and business unit policy requirements, reflecting a streamlined governance structure across the Group following the demerger of M&G plc.\n\nAll our Group-level financial crime policies are cascaded down to local/uni00A0business units through regional compliance teams, which ensure adherence to the Group requirements and applicable local laws and/uni00A0regulations. These policies form part of the Group Governance Framework, with business units attesting their compliance to the requirements each year. During the year, the Group and business units/uni00A0undertake a range of monitoring activities to ensure that business units are complying with Group policies and the legal and regulatory framework by which we are governed. This includes quarterly reporting, annual risk assessments, compliance monitoring reviews and reporting to Board-level committees, as set out below. Specifically, our Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions and Anti-Bribery and Corruption policies provide clear standards and guidance to our diverse businesses and highlight the importance of effective due diligence when dealing with customers, vendors and other third parties.\n\nWe complete annual risk assessments across all our businesses to assess and monitor their risk profile. The residual financial crime risk is/uni00A0managed through the continuous enhancement of the control environment and is implemented at local level. In recent years we have implemented an automated transaction monitoring system in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam to profile transactions and identify suspicious activities for reporting to law enforcement agencies.\n\nWe are committed to complying with international sanctions requirements and continue to monitor international sanctions closely, integrating updated lists into our regular customer and vendor screening processes. During the course of 2020, we have focused in particular on the US-China sanctions that have been issued in order to assess their impact on our business activities. We have upgraded our screening capabilities across all of our Asian businesses, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and improving operational efficiency.\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "The Group Risk Committee continues to review the effectiveness of/uni00A0the financial crime programme and the Group Compliance team regularly updates the Committee on risks, issues, the effectiveness of/uni00A0controls and the improvements made to processes in the financial crime framework. The Group Risk Committee regularly reviews a number of risk indicators in relation to financial crime, including the numbers and percentages of high-risk customers and politically exposed persons, and seeks investigation of movements. It also reviews trends in automated transaction activity alerts and employee-generated suspicious transaction reports. The Committee also reviews gifts and hospitality received and offered to ensure that they comply with our policy. All material matters on financial crime are/uni00A0reported to the Committee.\n\nThe financial crime teams remain committed to professional development and regularly participate in conferences and seminars in/uni00A0the UK, the US, Hong Kong and Singapore to build colleagues' skills/uni00A0and knowledge in specialist areas. Best practices are cascaded through training and communications, as well as the implementation of/uni00A0enhancements to operational systems. These ensure that our colleagues are fully prepared to recognise any form of economic crime and take adequate steps to combat it. We provide training to our staff to ensure that they are familiar with international standards and best practice, as well as being well equipped to implement our policies in their respective markets. Training completion levels are monitored throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nOur Group-wide whistleblowing procedures apply to all our colleagues and are supported by Speak Out, our Group-wide whistleblowing programme. Speak Out is available both internally and externally to staff, contractors, vendors, agents, customers and the public, enabling reporters to raise concerns in a choice of languages through web and hotline channels. Reporters are able to log concerns covering a range of issues, including but not limited to anti-bribery and/uni00A0corruption, compliance breaches, discrimination and harassment and health and safety. Concerns are recorded by an independent third party and investigated by internal appropriately trained and skilled investigators that are independent of the businesses they investigate. On an annual basis, all colleagues are required to complete a Speak/uni00A0Out computer-based training module. The programme is/uni00A0also/uni00A0supported by communications and awareness materials.\n\nWhistleblowing reporting is overseen by the Group Audit Committee and business unit audit committees through quarterly reporting and/uni00A0through frequent discussion with the Group Resilience Director, with any material issues reported to the Board. On an annual basis, emerging trends and an assessment of the effectiveness of our whistleblowing approach are reported to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nThe Speak Out programme is widely used throughout the Group, and during 2020 cases were reported across 24 jurisdictions, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines. The number of/uni00A0cases reported across our Asian business units represented 87 per cent of Speak Out cases, which is a reflection of our business footprint. During 2020, the top three issues reported through our whistleblowing channels related to discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment, compliance breaches and misconduct. HR-related cases accounted for 43 per cent of the total cases reported. This figure is in line with the external benchmarks that we use to monitor our Speak Out programme. The percentage of cases being reported openly, rather than anonymously, increased by 3 per cent year-on-year from 2019, which is considered an indicator of growing trust and confidence in the programme. Our Group Security Policy outlines our/uni00A0zero-tolerance approach to retaliation against reporters of any concerns raised via Speak Out.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nOur Group Code of Business Conduct outlines the values and standards that are required of each of our suppliers. Our Group Third/uni00A0Party Supply Policy is core to our supply chain governance and specifies our position on supply chain management, setting out our approach to due diligence, selection criteria, contractual requirements and ongoing monitoring of relationships.\n\nBusiness units conduct due diligence before engaging with, and ultimately selecting, a new supplier. We perform regular due diligence, including daily anti-money laundering checks on our supplier payments, supplier review meetings and audits where required, and/uni00A0our policies and procedures are supported by regular employee training exercises.\n\nOur due diligence requires our suppliers to pass financial stability tests and demonstrate a track record of high performance. We also review the controls the supplier has in place to prevent data leakage and look for any personal data protection issues. Additional due diligence is enacted for any problem categories where we are exposed to potential labour malpractice issues. Our Speak Out whistleblowing service enables employees to raise any concerns they may have in relation to/uni00A0our third-party relationships, and our contractors and third-party suppliers are also able to use this service.\n\nIn Asia, we have continued to progress our roll-out of the Coupa procurement management platform across our business units. By/uni00A0improving visibility across all third party spend, the system will facilitate cost savings, procurement and expense controls and process efficiencies. The system has now been implemented across our businesses in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Our business units in Vietnam and Taiwan and our/uni00A0asset management business, Eastspring, are expected to roll-out Coupa over the course of 2021, ensuring that more than 80 per cent of/uni00A0our third-party expenditure in Asia is processed and approved on one common platform.\n\nWe are also rolling out a dedicated third-party risk management system module and accompanying processes that will digitise and automate our vendor governance procedures, enabling us to complete all necessary risk assessments as part of our vendor and contract onboarding processes. This system module, Coupa Risk Assess, integrates into our Coupa procurement management platform and will/uni00A0provide us with detailed visibility of third-party risks across all our key risk domains, in particular information and technology security, data privacy, anti-bribery and corruption and business continuity and/uni00A0resiliency risks. This will improve our ability to mitigate risks and strengthen preventative risk management controls, thereby improving the resilience of our supply chain collaboratively with our vendors, providing greater assurance on our operating business environment. Coupa Risk Assess will also enable us to generate detailed insights into the level of commitment to ESG issues across our supplier footprint. The implementation is expected to be completed across all our markets in Asia during 2021.",

This is now incorporated in all our Global RFPs (request for pricing) issued to suppliers during the tender stage and requires a formal response by the potential supplier in respect of the following:\n\n- -Their commitment to ESG globally;\n- -Governance of ESG within their organisation;\n- -The leadership structure they have within their own organisation on/uni00A0ESG matters;\n- -ESG transparency on reporting and how that is executed;\n- -The responsible sourcing practices they use for their own supply chain buying;\n- -The use of management systems to track their own ESG compliance;\n- -Ethics and policy documents with their organisation to formally mandate ESG topics;\n- -Labour practice documents (to confirm ethical behaviour/modern slavery controls);\n- -Health and Safety best practices are confirmed as embedded for/uni00A0employee wellbeing; and\n- -Initiatives the supplier is launching to enhance their own ESG/uni00A0agenda.\n\n## Upholding our commitments to human rights\n\nBeing a responsible business requires organisations to ensure that they/uni00A0meet and strive to surpass commitments to the UN's Declaration of Human Rights. We are committed to ensuring that modern slavery, human trafficking, child labour or any other issue that subjugates human rights is eradicated from our supply chain. For more information around how we are identifying and managing our risks in/uni00A0relation to modern slavery, human trafficking, and child and forced/uni00A0labour, please read our Modern Slavery Statement on the Prudential plc website.\n\nCase study\n\n## Supporting smaller suppliers during Covid-19\n\nIn our commitment to supporting our supply chain through the difficult trading circumstances triggered by the global pandemic, we/uni00A0provided payment assistance from March 2020. We immediately switched to 10-day payment terms for all our London head office small suppliers with under 100 employees. This has so far benefited 136 suppliers with a total of \u00a36 million of accelerated payments made to assist their cash flow.\n\nAcross Asia, we apply the Third Party Risk Management policy, which/uni00A0ensures compliance to the Group's Third Party Supply policy. All/uni00A0third-party agreements across all countries in Asia are required to/uni00A0undergo due diligence activities, which include human trafficking, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption checks on the/uni00A0third parties that we deal with.\n\nAs in 2019, we reviewed our UK supplier spend to examine and reconfirm that, against the Walk Free Foundation's Global Slavery Index, we are not exposed to modern slavery issues in our supply chain. Our repeat review of this exercise has identified that, across the/uni00A0top 100 countries in the index, 2.5 per cent of UK procurement spend is exposed to these territories. This compares to 2.8 per cent in/uni00A02019. Our spend in these countries is in categories that are typically considered to be low-risk, such as property rental and professional services. Full supplier due diligence is maintained in these areas to avoid any potential issues and an expert panel meets each week to review both new contracts and renewals to ensure that we remain vigilant on potential modern slavery exposure and ESG topics. In the UK, we require our suppliers to pay their employees the London or UK/uni00A0Living Wage, as set by the Greater London Authority and Centre for Research in Social Policy respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responsible working practices and health and safety procedures\n\nPrudential recognises the importance of health, safety and wellbeing to help staff get the most out of life and meet our business objectives. By providing a safe and healthy workplace and preventing workrelated injury and ill-health through the implementation of appropriate policy and standards, we are able to provide an environment that helps employees to connect, grow and succeed in their work. In 2020 the Group-level policy and standards were revised and aligned with ISO 45001:2018, the international standard for Occupational Health and Safety. The policy and standards apply to all our companies, locations and activities.\n\nFor the year ending 31 December 2020, no work-related fatalities were/uni00A0recorded (2019: zero). There were 30 health and safety incidents, resulting in 422 days of lost time (2019: 74 incidents resulting in 203 days of lost time). The increase in lost time is accounted for by two incidents in the United States: a road traffic accident (164/uni00A0lost days), and a manual handling case (198 lost days).\n\nw\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

We have also focused on providing training and awareness on prevention measures and health and safety best practices for the home. Communications are regularly sent to staff reminding them of the behaviours and protocols needed to protect themselves and the wider community from Covid-19. Our communications have focused on local regulatory changes, maintaining high standards of hygiene, protocols around health monitoring and attendance at the office, and sensible social distancing. Where staff have returned to the office, masks are encouraged to be worn by staff in common areas of the office and in some jurisdictions this is mandated due to local regulations. The Group has also provided intranet resource centres where staff can seek information concerning Covid-19 precautions and best practices, travel restrictions and Covid-related news.\n\nHealth and safety teams across the Group have provided online seminars for staff and are available to staff should they have any questions or concerns. We have also implemented PRUThrive, a/uni00A0holistic wellbeing programme to support the mental, physical, financial, family and social wellbeing of employees. We also provide a/uni00A024 -hour Employee Assistance Programme, offering support and/uni00A0advice through an external provider, and in 2020 launched a/uni00A0science-based mental health and wellbeing app.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Treating customers fairly and responsible product design\n\nThe value that products are likely to bring to our customers and the quality of product materials and ongoing communications are given the utmost consideration in our businesses.

This complexity may/uni00A0make it difficult for a customer to understand the costs and value of/uni00A0the product, and how best to utilise the product to meet their needs.\n\nPrudential's products are designed in accordance with customer conduct standards of treating customers fairly and of providing products and services that meet customer needs, are easy to understand and deliver real value. We design products with a deep understanding of the target customers' protection and savings needs across their life stages. Our development process includes the assessment of policyholders' reasonable expectations created by/uni00A0the/uni00A0product and determines how those expectations are met and/uni00A0managed throughout the product lifecycle.\n\nWe aim to simplify our insurance products and how they are explained in product documentation and by salespersons, so that customers can easily understand the features, benefits and associated terms and conditions and are able to clearly assess how products fit with their needs. To protect vulnerable customers, our product development process identifies customer segments for whom the product is not suitable and/or where assistance and further protection might be needed during the sales journey (eg additional point of sales controls, welcome calls). Identifying and treating vulnerable customers with extra care is a core component of training for our sales force.\n\nNew products are approved by business unit product committees that comprise of participants from relevant business functions to ensure there is a complete understanding of product risks, including financial, capital and regulatory considerations, as well as a focus on the potential customer experience.\n\nThrough Pulse, our health and wealth super-app, we are increasingly focused on making insurance more inclusive to underserved populations of society, through bite-sized digital products and services at little or no cost, and minimal or no underwriting criteria or barriers.\n\nWe are also expanding from mortality and morbidity protection, to/uni00A0helping people prevent and postpone adverse health events. Accessible to everyone, Pulse combines healthcare and technology to/uni00A0help and incentivise people to prevent and postpone disease and protect customers by empowering them to take control of their health and wellbeing. We are also working with our distribution partners to increasingly design protection products with diversity and inclusion in/uni00A0mind, such as creating products for gender-specific needs.\n\nWe strive to ensure our claims process is simple, fair and transparent, and our staff and agents are professionally trained to support customers in their time of need. Each of our businesses closely monitors customer satisfaction using surveys at touchpoints throughout the customer journey, and also through the monitoring of complaints.\n\nOur businesses are required to comply with their local regulatory requirements and meet our Group-wide policies and standards, including our Group Code of Business Conduct and our Customer Conduct Risk Policy, which covers the fair treatment of customers. Compliance is achieved through the regular training of intermediaries to ensure that the salesforce has a clear understanding of our products, the target customers for each product, and the customer risks inherent in each product; and through the embedding of controls, including customer financial needs analysis and risk appetite profiling, to ensure the suitability of product sales. We are increasingly using technology, particularly electronic point-of-sale tools and e-submissions, to control the sales process and provide sufficient consumer safeguards. During 2020, our compliance controls evolved as we introduced virtual face-to-face selling and remote selling options during the Covid-19 pandemic. Compliance monitoring is performed across the customer and product life cycle, and disciplinary frameworks reinforce compliance through actions up to and including termination.\n\n## Management of direct operational environmental impacts\n\nWe seek to actively reduce our direct impact on the environment in/uni00A0line with our purpose of improving the lives of our customers and/uni00A0their communities. To understand our impact, we measure our/uni00A0environmental performance and take action to improve our/uni00A0performance.\n\nOur Group Environment Policy forms part of our Group Governance Manual and applies to our operational properties worldwide, guiding our approach to the management of the direct impacts of our business units. This includes compliance with environmental laws and regulations with respect to emissions, energy consumption, water use, waste disposal, environmental supply chain management and the adoption of risk management principles for all property-related matters. As with all policies, business unit performance is monitored against the Group Environment Policy and updates are provided to the/uni00A0Board. More information on our broader strategic approach to the/uni00A0management of climate change risks and opportunities is provided in the stewarding of the human impacts of climate change section on page 87 of this report.\n\nThe highlights of our 2020 environmental performance are available below. Our 2020 reporting covers the period 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020, and selected indicators are assured by Deloitte LLP. Where relevant, comparatives have been restated to remove M&G data.\n\nWe have set a target to become net carbon neutral across our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by the end of 2030, through a combination of a/uni00A025 per cent reduction per full time employee (FTE) in our operational emissions, and the implementation of carbon offsetting initiatives. The/uni00A0expression of the target in terms of an intensity ratio, rather than as/uni00A0a gross emissions figure, allows for the future growth in the size of our business, while driving improvements in the overall efficiency of our operations. These targets will take effect from 2021. Further details are provided later in this section.",

        "page_content": "Across our occupied estate, our global absolute Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions were 48,840 tCO 2 e, down 13.4 per cent on 2019. The main driver of the decline was the widespread reduction in energy use within our office network associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen normalised against net lettable floor area, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 96.24 kg CO 2 e/m 2 . This represented an 8.7 per cent reduction over 2019.\n\nThe magnitude of the decline across the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions was relatively modest, given the scale of the operational disruption caused by the pandemic. This reflects that most of the office estate in/uni00A0Asia and Africa remained open through the period to support a continued, albeit reduced, employee presence (through for example split team working). With social distancing measures in operation, the/uni00A0increased floor space required for each employee did not result in/uni00A0a/uni00A0proportionate reduction in energy use. It should also be noted that the effect of the timing of the reporting period for Group emissions (1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020) means that only nine months of pandemic-related impacts were captured in the 2020 reporting. With more of our employees working from home (and, therefore, consuming electricity) there has been an increase in emissions from this source, which has not been captured in our reporting. We have, however, started work to model the potential impact in order to understand the associated implications, noting that these would technically be categorised as Scope 3 emissions.\n\nTotal Scope 3 reported emissions fell by nearly two-thirds to 2,164 tCO 2 e. Air travel, which accounts for the majority of reported Scope 3 emissions, and it fell by 67.7 per cent to 1,965 tCO 2 e reflecting the impact of travel restrictions and other control measures related to the pandemic. We continue to work with our business units across all of our regions to extend our Scope 3 emission reporting.\n\nAcross Scope 1, 2 and 3, emissions per square metre fell 14.1 per cent to 100.51 kg CO 2 e/m 2 .\n\nIn 2021, we intend to review our Scope 3 reporting boundaries and/uni00A0broaden these over time. Our ultimate intention is to calculate and/uni00A0disclose emissions from our wider supply chain and investment portfolio in line with broader improvements in the quality of data and/uni00A0breadth of disclosures.\n\n## Regional emission trends\n\nThe restructuring of the Group, resulting in the demerger of M&G, has/uni00A0substantially reduced the Group's office footprint in the UK. The/uni00A0majority of the estate is now located in Asia and, to a lesser extent, in Africa.\n\nAsia's Scope 2 emissions have been in decline since 2017, falling to 23,183 t CO 2 e for Scope 2 emissions from 26,627 tCO 2 e in 2019 and were impacted by the pandemic, as noted above. During 2020, a total of 34 energy efficiency and behavioural change projects were carried out in Asia, with a combined estimated saving of 895 tCO 2 e per year. Measures implemented included the installation of LED lighting, installation of direct current motors in fan coil units and reducing lighting operation hours. We also implemented eight waste reduction initiatives in 2020, including initiatives such as donating excess furniture to be used in an agency office rather than disposal in Malaysia, and providing reusable lunch bags and reducing the use/uni00A0of/uni00A0plastic single use water bottles in Indonesia.\n\nOur occupied estate in Africa expanded by 68 per cent in 2020, with a/uni00A0concurrent increase in headcount of 75 per cent, and we expect the Africa footprint to continue to grow. The gathering of energy data in Africa continues to become more reliable, leading to improvements in data quality and completeness.\n\nThe Jackson property portfolio represents 26 per cent of the occupied area of Prudential and accounts for 49 per cent of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint. This is predominately due to the presence of data and disaster recovery centres in the portfolio, which are very energyintensive and against which it is more challenging to deliver energy saving. However, there has been a 12.1 per cent intensity reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2020, reducing them to 179 kg CO 2 e/m 2 . These reductions can be attributed predominantly to lower occupancy and shutdowns associated with the pandemic, as the occupied area and overall headcount have remained consistent with 2019. The impact of the pandemic is also noted in the 35 per cent reduction in Scope 1 emissions.\n\n## Waste and recycling\n\nThe quality of our waste and recycling reporting continues to improve, although some challenges remain. For example, where we are tenants in multi-tenanted buildings, the data is only provided to us on a consolidated basis and not broken down by individual tenant.\n\nDuring 2020 we generated 749 tonnes of waste in the UK and US included in our Scope 3 reporting. The Scope 3 carbon emissions associated with our total waste generation are calculated at 140 tCO 2 e, a minor contribution to our overall corporate footprint in comparison with the energy use of our buildings and air travel. Of the UK and the US total, 62 per cent was diverted from landfill through recycling, composting or incineration.\n\nThe gathering of waste data in Asia has increased in 2020. We have developed a set of Waste Management Guidelines to raise awareness of the importance of accurate reporting of waste, as well as to practical advice on waste reduction measures for employees engaged in waste management activities.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nIn 2020, absolute use of water across our global occupied estate (excluding Africa) was 170,648 m 3 , an intensity ratio of 0.35m 3 /m 2 , a/uni00A0reduction of 26 per cent when compared with our like-for-like water consumption in 2019.\n\nAs part of our site assessment programme in Asia, the inspection team/uni00A0looked at our water usage to identify ways in which we could reduce our water consumption. As we are predominately tenants in multi-tenanted buildings, where the landlords are responsible for the maintenance and management of the air conditioning, toilets and other/uni00A0common facilities, only limited opportunities to reduce our water/uni00A0consumption were identified.",

As/uni00A0reported in our 2019 report, this framework was based on the operational footprint of the pre-demerger Prudential Group and, as/uni00A0such, several targets are no longer relevant to the demerged Group.\n\nOur Asian operations have completed four of their five targets, and/uni00A0partially completed the fifth target. Through the programmes implemented as part of this process, we have gained a greater insight into how our sites currently consume energy and the opportunities to/uni00A0reduce this consumption. Notably, we have completed an environmental emission review for the 20 largest energy-consuming locations; created environmental guidelines for all new leasing and fit-out projects; and reviewed our water efficiency and waste management with guidelines adopted by our businesses. The energy management campaign was delayed to better leverage the data collected in the energy assessment, and then further delayed by the/uni00A0Covid-19 pandemic, but will be launched in 2021 to support our new targets.\n\n## New targets for 2030\n\nDuring 2020, we reviewed our global environmental targets framework and have established new targets for the period 2021 to 2030. Our aim is to become net carbon-neutral across our Scope 1 and/uni00A0Scope 2 emissions by the end of 2030, through a combination\n\nof/uni00A0a/uni00A025 per cent reduction (per FTE) in our operational emissions and implementing carbon offsetting initiatives. This commitment is aligned to our purpose of helping people get the most out of life by enabling a/uni00A0lower-carbon economy through good governance and responsible business practices. The new target will apply across all our operations and improve our ability to communicate a simple and clear environmental strategic direction to all our stakeholders.\n\nDuring 2020, we engaged a global property services company in a multi-year contract to provide specialist environmental consultancy services to support our aim of reducing the intensity ratios in our Scope/uni00A01 and 2 carbon emissions.\n\nOur priority is to reduce our carbon emissions, on an intensity metric, and the site assessment programme has highlighted a number of initiatives that we can implement across the property portfolio to achieve this aim, as well as practical measures that we can take to deliver operational improvements. From these assessments, Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction road maps are being developed to support the delivery against our target.\n\nWe have gained a clear understanding of how we use energy within our property portfolio, and given that the majority of our office space is/uni00A0leased on relatively short-term commitments, we have opportunities to address operational improvements as leases come up for renewal through implementing energy-saving measures or selecting more energy-efficient spaces.\n\nIn parallel to these initiatives in our existing property portfolio, we are rolling out a campaign in 2021 to drive behavioural change in terms of energy, water and waste reduction, and it is anticipated that this will be vital to the achievement of our targets.\n\nWe are implementing a range of tools and initiatives that will enable further reductions in the Group's energy consumption footprint over the longer term. Some examples include the development of green leasing and design guidelines to assist property management teams to/uni00A0select premises and design our workplaces that will help achieve energy efficiencies; the embedding of sustainability considerations being highlighted in our project approval process; and improved performance tracking through the use of a web-based platform, which/uni00A0will enable our businesses to track progress against targets at/uni00A0an/uni00A0asset level.\n\n## Enforcement actions and other regulatory events\n\nNo fines or regulatory actions occurred during the year for/uni00A0environmental incidents (2019: zero).\n\n## Strategic report approval by the Board of Directors\n\nThe strategic report set out on pages 10 to 117 is approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mike Wells\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n2 March 2021\n\no\n\nn",

Given the severe curtailment on travel during 2020, we were unable to conduct our usual programme of face-to-face meetings with management and employees, which typically would have included deep dive visits at one or more of our business locations. Instead, we have found other virtual ways to connect with people across the business.\n\n2020 saw important changes to the Board. Paul Manduca, who stepped down as Chairman and Director at the end of 2020, left a legacy of a high-functioning Board of committed Directors. Sir Howard Davies stepped down after 10 years on the Board and as Chair of our Risk Committee, and Jeremy Anderson was appointed to the Board, bringing with him substantial leadership experience of the financial services sector across Asia and the US. Jeremy has extensive technical knowledge on audit and risk management, particularly concerning international companies, and he succeeded Sir Howard as Chair of the/uni00A0Risk Committee in May 2020. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Paul and Howard for their significant contributions and leadership of the Board and Risk Committee respectively during their tenures. We/uni00A0will be losing more of our experienced Non-executive Directors in/uni00A0the next couple of years as they are reaching the end of their nine-year tenures. Following nine years of service Kai Nargolwala will not offer himself for/uni00A0re-election at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) this year.\n\nI would like to thank Kai, who will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM, for his significant contribution, both on the Board and as a member of the Risk and Remuneration Committees. More recently, Kai also took on the role of Employee Engagement Director for the Group's workforce in Asia and Africa.\n\nBelow are some of the principal strategic and governance items the/uni00A0Board considered during 2020.\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn its strategy discussions, the Board focused on developing and repositioning the Group for Asian growth. The Board considers that/uni00A0the Group is well positioned to meet the protection and savings needs/uni00A0of the growing populations in Asia and Africa with top-three positions in nine Asian life insurance markets, and significant upside potential in the region's two largest markets. The new growth strategy has been set to align to markets where insurance penetration is currently low and demand for savings solutions is rapidly developing. In August, we/uni00A0announced the new dividend policy, which aligns to this/uni00A0revised strategy.\n\nTime and attention were given to executing the decision, announced in/uni00A02020, to separate our US business, through detailed discussions during regular Board meetings and dedicated, additional workshops. This was to ensure that Jackson will have a governance framework suitable for a listed group in the US at the point of the proposed separation. This culminated in our announcement on 28 January 2021 of our plan to separate Jackson in the second quarter of 2021 through a/uni00A0demerger, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our purpose, culture and values\n\nGood governance encourages decisions to be made in a way that is/uni00A0most likely to promote the long-term, sustainable success of the Company, taking into account the views and interests of the Group's wider stakeholders. We aim to achieve this through a governance framework that supports decision-making, facilitates challenge, is/uni00A0continuously updated to meet the Group's business needs, and/uni00A0encompasses a prudent system of internal controls and rigorous processes for identifying, managing and mitigating key risks.\n\nAfter an extensive consultation over the course of nine months involving 12,000 employees, we have refreshed and restated our shared purpose - to help people get the most out of life. We fulfil this purpose by making healthcare accessible and affordable, protecting wealth and growing assets, and empowering people to save for their/uni00A0education and retirement goals. The Board supported the articulation and development of a framework to embed the desired culture, promoting the Group's purpose consistently across the Group. A/uni00A0description of how Prudential views its purpose as inextricably linked with its business and delivers on it/uni00A0is set out in the ESG report on/uni00A0pages 70 to 117.\n\n2020 was the first year of a three-year plan to promote and embed a/uni00A0diverse and inclusive culture across the Group with our purpose at its/uni00A0core, supporting our/uni00A0people to think about not only what they do but how they do it, aligning our behaviours with performance and managing risks. Embedding this cultural change will require systems and programmes that help shift behaviours and create new habits, both individually and/uni00A0organisationally. This has been a key focus during the year and the/uni00A0Board has discussed, reviewed and monitored the frameworks being put into place to enable this progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Looking after our stakeholders and wider community initiatives\n\nAt Prudential, we recognise that all our stakeholders are key to our long-term success. We seek to engage proactively with them, to understand their views and to take these views into account when making decisions. Further information about how the Board has taken into account the views of the Group's key stakeholders, can be found on pages 78 to 81, while engagement with our customers is discussed in more detail on page 79.",

        "page_content": "Throughout 2020, the Board was particularly concerned about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the health and welfare of customers and employees. The CEO Report and ESG Report describe the various ways in which we responded to the needs of our customers in this challenging period. Our two designated Non-executive Directors appointed to represent the workforce have been working hard to find innovative ways to engage with the workforce during what has been an incredibly difficult year in which to bring people together. They joined a number of events at the start of the year, including visiting our offices in the UK and Asia to meet with and address colleagues. Once the pandemic started, both designated Directors received briefings from Group Security about steps being taken to support and protect employees during the Covid-19 outbreak. The results of our staff survey in 2020 have been considered carefully by the Board and the designated Directors are monitoring the implementation of the action plans, which will enable our employees to see that their feedback has been taken seriously and acted upon. Both designated Directors participated in our follow-up Collaboration Jam, which is described more fully on pages 79 and 96. We will continue to/uni00A0keep our/uni00A0employee engagement mechanisms under review to/uni00A0ensure we choose methods that best serve our employees and/uni00A0provide useful feedback to the Board.\n\nThe Board considered Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters and approved the ESG strategic framework for the Group, on/uni00A0the recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee. A number of Directors and members of the Nomination & Governance Committee, as well as other stakeholders, were consulted during the year to shape this strategy. For more information, please see the Nomination & Governance Committee report on pages 142 and 148. You/uni00A0can read more about our corporate social responsibility actions in our 2020 ESG report (pages 70 to 117), which will also be/uni00A0published on our website.\n\n## Focus for 2021\n\nSince I joined Prudential, in light of the transformation of the business, the composition of the Board has been one of my key priorities, supported by the work of the Nomination & Governance Committee. Reflecting our focus on growth in Asia and Africa, enabled by digital capabilities, I am pleased to welcome Chua Sock Koong and Ming Lu to the Board. Sock Koong has had a distinguished career with operations experience in many of our key markets, while Ming has a long track record of investing in and growing businesses throughout Asia. These appointments are part of an ongoing process to refresh the Board and make sure it has the right skills and experience to support the Group, in particular pan-Asian operating experience, and a high degree of digital familiarity. The next phase of appointments will focus on experience and knowledge of specialist financial services.\n\nAs the Board changes, I am keen to ensure that we mitigate some of the/uni00A0loss of experience, wisdom and institutional memory by enabling new Non-executive Directors joining the Board to overlap with those nearing retirement, to give new joiners sufficient time to benefit from building relationships and sharing experience and insight to ensure a smooth transition period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to continuing to develop the Group's governance to/uni00A0ensure that it keeps pace with the rapid progress of the business and/uni00A0the evolving external environment. We will draw on the conclusions of the externally facilitated Board effectiveness evaluation conducted in/uni00A02020 by Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation, to ensure continued strong oversight and challenge. The methodology and results of that evaluation are set out on page 133. This annual exercise helps inform how we approach governance, risk and culture, which is set out in/uni00A0the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's Report on pages 45 to/uni00A069. Our Group-wide Internal Audit function will/uni00A0continue to consider the risk and control culture of the organisation/uni00A0throughout its activities, with our Group Code of Business/uni00A0Conduct underpinning everything we/uni00A0do, shaping our culture/uni00A0and linking culture explicitly to values and behaviours. Good governance includes a commitment to continuous improvement and to that end the Board has asked Jeremy Anderson to lead on considering any lessons for the Board to learn from the revision to Jackson's hedge modelling, announced on 28 January, which impacted Jackson's statutory capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur clarity of strategy and purpose will be supported and enabled by/uni00A0our culture and the people who make them a reality. I am clear that our strength - as people and in our performance - will come from continued investment in our diversity and inclusion. The Board has a/uni00A0vital role in setting the tone and demonstrating this in the diversity of/uni00A0our thinking, and/uni00A0through our oversight, constructive challenge and/uni00A0support for management and/uni00A0Prudential's employees. The/uni00A0Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, established by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board and chaired by Alice Schroeder, will oversee the embedding of Prudential's ESG framework and progress on diversity/uni00A0and inclusion initiatives, and will take on employee engagement activities.\n\nI hope this report and those of my fellow Committee Chairs demonstrate the work we have undertaken and the tangible and positive impact this has had on our business and for our stakeholders, with oversight and challenge to promote the long-term success of Prudential and the long-term prosperity of our stakeholders. On a/uni00A0personal level, I was disappointed not to be able to attend what would have been my first Prudential AGM in May 2020 as a Nonexecutive Director, and unfortunately it does not look possible to meet shareholders in person at this year's AGM under current restrictions. We are working hard to ensure that shareholders will be able to participate fully through digital means. The detailed arrangements will/uni00A0be communicated as part of our AGM Notice published in April. I/uni00A0look forward to updating you then and in future Annual Reports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShriti Vadera\n\nChair\n\nG\n\nF\n\nE",

Throughout the Annual Report we have inserted red-circled letters to indicate which section, page or paragraph demonstrates our compliance.\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose\n\n- A A successful company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial board, whose role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society.\n- B The board should establish the company's purpose, values and strategy, and satisfy itself that these and its culture are aligned. All directors must act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n- C The board should ensure that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives and measure performance against them. The board should also establish a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed.\n- D In order for the company to meet its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders, the board should ensure effective engagement with, and encourage participation from, these parties.\n- E The board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are consistent with the company's values and support its long-term sustainable success. The workforce should be able to raise any matters of concern.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\n- F The chair leads the board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company. They should demonstrate objective judgement throughout their tenure and promote a culture of openness and debate. In addition, the chair facilitates constructive board relations and the effective contribution of all non-executive directors, and ensures that directors receive accurate, timely and clear information.\n- G The board should include an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive (and, in particular, independent non-executive) directors, such that no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the board's decision-making. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the board and the executive leadership of the company's business.\n- H Non-executive directors should have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. They should provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold management to account.\n- I The board, supported by the company secretary, should ensure that it has the policies, processes, information, time and resources it needs in order to function effectively and efficiently.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n- J Appointments to the board should be subject to a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure, and an effective succession plan should be maintained for board and senior management. Both appointments and succession plans should be based on merit and objective criteria and, within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\n- K The board and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge. Consideration should be given to the length of service of the board as a whole and membership regularly refreshed.\n- L Annual evaluation of the board should consider its composition, diversity and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives. Individual evaluation should demonstrate whether each director continues to contribute effectively.\n\n## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n- M   The board should establish formal and transparent policies and procedures to ensure the independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit functions and satisfy itself on the integrity of financial and narrative statements.\n- N The board should present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects.\n- O The board should establish procedures to manage risk, oversee the internal control framework, and determine the nature and extent of the principal risks the company is willing to take in order to achieve its long-term strategic objectives.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n- P Remuneration policies and practices should be designed to support strategy and promote long-term sustainable success. Executive remuneration should be aligned to company purpose and values, and be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the company's long-term strategy.\n- Q A formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and determining director and senior management remuneration should be established. No director should be involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.\n- R Directors should exercise independent judgement and discretion when authorising remuneration outcomes, taking account of company and individual performance, and wider circumstances.\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## How we operate\n\n## This section tells you more about the Group's governance, operation of the Board and Board roles.\n\n## Group governance\n\n## Corporate governance codes - statement of compliance\n\nThe Company has dual primary listings in London (premium listing) and Hong Kong (Main board listing) and has therefore adopted a governance structure based on the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes (the UK and HK Codes). This report explains how/uni00A0the principles set out in the UK and HK Codes have been applied.\n\nThe Board confirms that, for the year under review, the Company has complied with the principles and provisions of the UK Code. Please see page 127 where we set out how we have applied the principles.\n\nThe Company has also complied with the provisions of the HK Code other than as follows: Provision B.1.2(d) of the HK Code requires companies, on a comply or explain basis, to have a remuneration committee which makes recommendations to a main board on the remuneration of non-executive directors. This provision is not compatible with principle Q of the UK Code which states that no director should be involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome, and provision 34 of the UK Code which recommends that the board determines the remuneration of non-executive directors. Prudential has chosen to adopt a practice in line with the recommendations of the UK Code.\n\nFollowing the introduction by the UK government of measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 by prohibiting non-essential travel and public gatherings of more than two people, and following the issuance of the/uni00A0Company's 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM) Notice, the Company provided an update to shareholders in late April 2020 on its revised arrangements for the 2020 AGM. In light of those restrictions and/uni00A0to protect the health of Prudential's shareholders and employees, the Board decided, with regret, that shareholders, external advisers (including the auditor) and Directors (other than the Chairman) would not be able to attend the AGM in person (and thus provisions A.6.7 and E.1.2 of the HK Code could not be complied with).\n\nThe UK Code is available from: www.frc.org.uk\n\nThe HK Code is available from: www.hkex.com.hk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our governance framework\n\nThe Group has established a governance framework for the business, which is approved by the Board, and is designed to promote appropriate behaviours across the Group. The Nomination & Governance Committee keeps material changes to the governance arrangements under review.\n\nThe governance framework includes the key mechanisms through which the Group sets strategy, plans its objectives, monitors performance, considers risk management, holds business units to account for delivering on business plans and arranges governance.\n\n## Group Governance Manual\n\nThe Group Governance Manual (the Manual) sets out the policies and/uni00A0procedures under which the Group operates, taking into account statutory, regulatory and other relevant matters. The Manual includes the Group Code of Business Conduct which is regularly reviewed by the Board. The Risk Committee approves the Group Risk Framework, an integral part of the Manual, and the Audit Committee monitors Group-wide compliance with the Manual throughout the year.\n\nBusiness units manage and report compliance with the Group-wide mandatory requirements set out in the Manual through annual attestations. This includes compliance with our risk management framework, details of which are set out on pages 139 to 140 of/uni00A0t his/uni00A0repor t.\n\nThe content of the Manual is reviewed regularly, reflecting the developing nature of both the Group and the markets in which it operates, with significant changes on key policies reported to the relevant Board Committee.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nSince the demerger of M&G plc in October 2019, the Group has made changes to its/uni00A0subsidiary audit and governance arrangements to reflect the changing shape of the Group, in particular with respect to the Asia business. The Group Audit and Risk Committees have established direct links to the audit and risk committees of the/uni00A0four major Asia insurance businesses, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Arrangements include regular reports and calls between the Chairs of/uni00A0the Group committees and the local committee chairs, with an open invitation to the Group Committee Chairs to attend the committee meetings of the major Asia business.\n\nIn addition, an internal legal restructuring has been undertaken to form/uni00A0a holding company for Eastspring managed entities, Eastspring Investments Group Pte. Ltd. This has created a regional board as well as audit and risk committees with consolidated oversight across the Eastspring business unit and a direct link to the Group-level Audit and/uni00A0Risk Committees.\n\nOther Prudential Corporation Asia businesses also operate local audit/uni00A0and risk committees, with standard terms of reference. Those committees report to the Group-level committees through written updates provided by the attendees from Group functions.\n\nThe Nomination & Governance Committee is responsible for oversight of governance arrangements for the significant subsidiaries. A report on the activities of the Nomination & Governance Committee during 2020 can be found on pages 141 to 149.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nFollowing the demerger of M&G plc on 21 October 2019, the Group-wide supervisor of Prudential changed to the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (the Hong Kong IA). On 24 July 2020 the Insurance (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance, being the enabling primary legislation providing for the GWS Framework, was enacted. This primary legislation is supported by subsidiary legislation and guidance material from the Hong Kong IA. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021.",

Additional information can be found on/uni00A0our website at www.prudentialplc.com/about-us/esg/our-approach\n\n## Employee voice\n\nThe Board has designated two Non-executive Directors to represent the workforce; Kai Nargolwala with responsibility for Asia and Africa, and Tom Watjen with responsibility for the US and the UK.\n\nThe Board received an update on activities undertaken and themes arising for consideration on a six-monthly basis. Kai Nargolwala and Tom Watjen offer their insight to Board discussions and decisions as part of the Board's consideration of the workforce as key stakeholders. Kai Nargolwala will be retiring at the AGM in May and post the proposed separation of Jackson the work he and Tom Watjen undertook will be continued by the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group. As part of this, the Working Group will consider the best method for employee engagement in the longer term, to ensure this is tailored to the culture and strategic priorities of the refocused Group following the proposed separation of the Jackson business, and/uni00A0make a recommendation to the Board for implementation following the 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\nPlease see the Section 172 statement on pages 78 to 81 for an overview of the activities undertaken during 2020.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of maintaining an appropriate level of two-way communication with shareholders. The Group holds an ongoing programme of regular contact with major shareholders, conducted by the Chair, to discuss their views on the Group's governance. The Senior Independent Director and the Committee Chairs are available at the request of shareholders. Engagement with/uni00A0institutional investors on the Directors' Remuneration Policy and/uni00A0implementation is led by the Remuneration Committee Chair on/uni00A0an annual basis.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the governance meetings held with investors by Paul Manduca, Shriti Vadera met with a large number of/uni00A0our major investors as part of her introduction to the business. The/uni00A0Chair of the Remuneration Committee also engaged with our investors on the Directors' Remuneration Policy. Please see our Section 172 Statement on pages 78 to 81 for more information on/uni00A0interactions with shareholders and other key stakeholders.\n\nDue to the UK government restrictions to limit the spread of Covid-19, the AGM on 14 May 2020 chaired by Paul Manduca was held as a 'closed meeting' with just two shareholders to provide the requisite quorum to enable the formal business of passing resolutions to be conducted. In recognising the continuing importance of the AGM as an opportunity to engage with shareholders, the Board encouraged participation from shareholders. The revised meeting arrangements included an option for shareholders to submit questions to the Board in/uni00A0advance of the meeting, the answers to which were posted on the Company's website, and shareholders were also asked to vote their shares by proxy ahead of the meeting. Prudential kept shareholders informed through its website and released a number of updates during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, including a Q1 business update and other presentations.\n\nNotwithstanding the pandemic and related unprecedented measures and circumstances, the Board continues to receive regular updates on/uni00A0shareholder engagement activities.\n\n## A B C D H I\n\n## Operation of the Board\n\n## How the Board leads the Group\n\nThe Group is headed by a Board led by the Chair.\n\nThe Board currently consists of 13 Directors, of which a majority, excluding the Chair are independent Non-executive Directors. Biographical details of each of the Directors can be found on pages 122 to 126 and further details of the roles of the Chair, Group Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director, Committee Chairs and the Non-executive Directors can be found on pages 134 to 136.\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the long-term sustainable success of the business through:\n\n- -Establishing the Company's purpose, values and strategy and satisfying itself that these are aligned with the Group's culture;\n- -Approving the Group's long-term strategy, strategic objectives, capital allocation, annual budgets and business plans, recommended by the Group Chief Executive, and any material changes to them;\n- -Monitoring the implementation of strategic objectives; and\n- -Assessing and monitoring culture, including alignment with policy, practices, behaviours and risk appetite.\n\nSpecific matters are reserved for decision by the Board, including:\n\n- -Approving dividend policy and determination of dividends or other capital distributions;\n- -Approving of strategic projects;\n- -Approving of the three-year business and financial plan;\n- -Appointing and removing of Directors and the Company Secretary;\n- -Approving of the Group's full and half-yearly results\n- announcements and any other periodic financial reporting;\n- -Ensuring an effective system of internal control and risk management is in place, maintained and reviewed at least annually;\n- -Approving the Group's overall risk appetite and tolerance; and\n- -Ensuring effective engagement with, and encouraging participation from, key stakeholder groups.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The external nature of the review met the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code which requires external evaluations on no less than three-yearly intervals.\n\nThe evaluation covered the Board, each of the principal committees, and an individual assessment of the Chair and each of the other Non-executive Directors. The Board evaluation focused on Board performance and focus, Board composition, succession planning and induction, and/uni00A0support provided to Board members. The evaluation included seeking feedback from each Director, the Company Secretary and/uni00A0senior management.\n\nInterviews were held with all Board members and other stakeholders, and these were supplemented by attendance and observation at a number of Board and Committee meetings. Supporting materials to enhance understanding of how the Board and its Committees operate were provided.\n\nThe findings were presented to the Nomination & Governance Committee and the Board in December 2020 and collective Committee and Board discussions to exchange ideas and agree priorities arising from the report took place.\n\nThe Board agreed an action plan to respond to the recommendations at its meeting in February.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe report identified a number of strengths of the Board, including a strong Board culture of engagement and collaboration, strong governance and compliance, and clear, timely information being provided to support Board meetings. The evaluation concluded that the Board and its principal committees were operating effectively. Some areas were identified for development in order to support the onboarding of new Board members and to keep pace with the transformation of the Group.\n\nThrough the evaluation and subsequent additional discussion at the Board meeting in February 2021, the Board identified areas of particular focus and/uni00A0related actions:\n\n| Theme Summary of actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maximising Board  inclusivity -Enhance induction processes to leverage new Board members' skills as quickly as possible. -Recognising the challenge with current travel restrictions, create more opportunities for less formal discussion  among Board members.                                                                                                                          |\n| Focusing on  the/uni00A0People and  ESG/uni00A0Agenda -Consider how best to give additional Board time and focus to the ESG and people agenda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Improvements to  Board information  flows  -As the shape of the Group changes, build up Board members' depth of knowledge of the Asia and Africa business  and re-focus the Board agenda to maximise time considering business performance and strategy on a more  granular basis. -Review and strengthen links with subsidiary boards to leverage insight and support from those boards. |\n| Improvements to  Board processes -Consider processes for briefings outside of meetings to support inclusivity and maximise ways in which Board  members benefit from each other's experience and expertise.                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Director evaluation\n\nThe performance of Directors during 2020 was evaluated by Independent Board Evaluation as part of the overall Board evaluation programme. Feedback on individual performance of Non-executive Directors was provided to the then Chair designate, who held discussions with each of/uni00A0them at the start of 2021 on becoming Chair. Feedback on the performance of the then Chair designate was separately provided to, and discussed with her, by the Senior Independent Director. Feedback on the performance of the Executive Directors, in their capacity as Board Directors, was also provided to the Chair designate, who discussed feedback with each of them separately.\n\nThe performance of Executive Directors, in their capacity as Executives, is subject to regular review; Paul Manduca assessed the/uni00A0performance of/uni00A0the Group Chief Executive while Mike Wells individually appraised the performance of each of the Executive Directors as part of the annual Group-wide performance evaluation of/uni00A0all employees. The Chair of the Risk Committee provided feedback to the Group Chief Executive on the/uni00A0performance of the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer.\n\nThe outcome of each of these evaluation processes is reported to the Nomination & Governance Committee in February each year in order to/uni00A0inform the Committee's recommendation for Board members to be put forward for re-election by shareholders.\n\nExecutive Director performance is also reviewed by the Remuneration Committee as part of its deliberations on bonus payments.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Standing Committee\n\nThe Board has established a Standing Committee which can meet as/uni00A0required to assist with any business of the Board. It is typically used/uni00A0for ad hoc urgent matters which cannot be delayed until the next/uni00A0scheduled Board meeting. All Directors are members of the Standing Committee and have the right to attend all meetings and receive papers.\n\nNotice of a Standing Committee meeting is sent to all Directors and/uni00A0if/uni00A0an individual is unable to attend, that individual can give comments to the Chair or Company Secretary ahead of the meeting for/uni00A0consideration by/uni00A0the Standing Committee. Before taking decisions on any matter, the/uni00A0Standing Committee must first determine that the business it is intending to consider is appropriate for a Committee of the Board and/uni00A0does not properly need to be brought before the whole Board. All/uni00A0Standing Committee meetings are reported in full to the next scheduled Board meeting.\n\nThis governance structure allows for fast decision-making where necessary, while ensuring that the full Board has oversight of all matters under consideration and all Non-executive Directors can contribute. Over 2020, the Company held three meetings of the Standing Committee.\n\n## Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group\n\n## Chair\n\n## Alice Schroeder\n\nFollowing the Board's approval in December 2020 of a new Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Strategic Framework, the Board recognises that the next 18 months will be critical for the/uni00A0embedding of the framework within the Group, as well as for/uni00A0the progress of related matters such as the development and embedding of the Group's Purpose and Values, progressing diversity & inclusion (D&I) priorities, and building upon employee engagement activities in 2020.\n\nTo ensure an appropriate level of Board engagement in, and oversight of, these matters, the Board has established for the period up to the 2022 AGM a Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, to be chaired by Alice Schroeder. As part of its remit, the/uni00A0Working Group will consider and recommend to the Board appropriate long-term governance arrangements for these matters. It will also take on employee engagement activities after the 2021/uni00A0AGM.\n\n## Building Directors' knowledge\n\n## Induction - new Directors\n\nJeremy Anderson and Shriti Vadera received a comprehensive induction, tailored to reflect their respective experience and positions on the Board.\n\nA summary of the general induction programme for Non-executive Directors is set out below:\n\n| Understanding our governance                                                                                                                              | Understanding our business                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -Meetings with the Chair  and/uni00A0Group Chief Executive  separately  -Explanation of Prudential's  corporate structure, Board  and Executive Committee | -Introduction to the Group's  strategy and business plan -Tailored briefings with  senior executives from each  business unit, including site  visits, to facilitate a  comprehensive  understanding of local  business models, product |\n| structure -Briefings on Group  governance framework  and/uni00A0key policies -Training as needed on the  rules and governance  requirements of the London | and governance structures  -Tailored meetings with all  Group-wide functions                                                                                                                                                            |\n| and Hong Kong Stock  Exchanges and on fulfilling  the statutory duties of  a/uni00A0D irec tor                                                            | suites, pricing arrangements  -Comprehensive briefings on  the regulatory environment  in which the Group operates -Briefings on top risks and  internal controls                                                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRole-specific induction for Jeremy Anderson focused on briefings from senior management in Group Risk across the Group and briefings from the outgoing Group Risk Committee Chair.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate and effective system of risk management and internal control is in place across the/uni00A0Group. The framework of risk management and internal control centres on clear delegated authorities to ensure Board oversight and control of important decisions. The framework is underpinned by the Group Code of Business Conduct, which sets out the ethical standards the Board requires of itself, employees, agents and others working on/uni00A0behalf of the Group, and is supported by a set of Group-wide principles and values that define how the Group expects business to/uni00A0be conducted in order to achieve its strategic objectives. The framework is designed to monitor and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Group Governance Manual (the Manual) sets out the general principles by which we conduct our business and ourselves and defines our Group-wide approach to Governance, Risk Management and Internal Control. Further information on the Manual is included in the Governance Framework section on page 128. Group-wide policies, internal controls and processes, based on the provisions established in the Manual, are in place across the Group. These include controls covering the preparation of financial reporting. The operation of these controls and processes facilitates the preparation of reliable financial reporting and the preparation of local and consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These controls include certifications by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of each business unit with respect to the accuracy of/uni00A0information provided for use in preparation of the Group's consolidated financial reporting, and the assurance work carried out/uni00A0in/uni00A0respect of US reporting requirements.\n\nThe Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee to review the framework and effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control. The Audit Committee is supported in this responsibility by the/uni00A0assurance work carried out by Group-wide Internal Audit and the/uni00A0work of the audit committees of the Group's major businesses, which oversee the effectiveness of controls in each respective business. Details of how the Audit Committee oversees the framework of controls and their effectiveness on an ongoing basis, is set out more/uni00A0fully in the report on pages 150 to 160.\n\n## Risk management\n\nA key component of the Manual is the Group Risk Framework, which/uni00A0requires all business units to establish processes for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks facing the business.\n\nThe Board determines the nature and extent of the principal risks it is/uni00A0willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. The Board has delegated authority to the Risk Committee to assist it in providing leadership, direction and oversight of the Group's overall risk appetite, risk tolerance and strategy; overseeing and advising on the current and potential future risk exposures of the Group, reviewing and approving the Group's risk management framework, including changes to risk limits within the overall Board approved risk appetite, monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management framework and adherence to the/uni00A0various risk policies. Regular activities are detailed in the report on/uni00A0pages 45 to 69.\n\nThe Group's risk governance arrangements, which support the Board,/uni00A0the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, are based on the/uni00A0principles of the 'three lines of defence' model: risk taking and management, risk control and oversight, and independent assurance.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\n## First line of defence (risk taking and management)\n\n- -Takes and manages risk exposures in accordance with the risk appetite, mandate and limits set by the Board;\n- -Identifies and reports the risks that the Group is exposed to, and/uni00A0those that are emerging;\n- -Promptly escalates any limit breaches or any violations of risk management policies, mandates or instructions;\n- -Identifies and promptly escalates significant emerging risk issues; and\n- -Manages the business to ensure full compliance with the Group risk management framework as set out in the Manual, which among other requirements, includes the Group Risk Framework and associated policies as well as approval requirements.\n\n## Second line of defence (risk control and oversight)\n\n- -Assists the Board to formulate the risk appetite and limit framework, risk management plans, risk policies, risk reporting and risk identification processes; and\n- -Reviews and assesses the risk-taking activities of the first line of/uni00A0defence, providing risk opinions and where appropriate challenging the actions being taken to manage and control risks.\n\n## Third line of defence (independent assurance)\n\n- -Provides independent assurance on the design, effectiveness and implementation of the overall system of internal control, including risk management and compliance.\n\nEach business unit is required to implement a governance structure based on the three lines of defence model, proportionate to its size, nature and complexity, and to the risks that it manages.\n\n## Formal review of controls\n\nA formal evaluation of the system of risk management and internal control is carried out at least annually. Prior to the Board reaching a/uni00A0conclusion on the effectiveness of the system in place, the report is/uni00A0considered by the Disclosure Committee and Audit Committee, with/uni00A0risk specific disclosures within the report also reviewed by the Risk Committee. This evaluation takes place prior to the publication of/uni00A0the Annual Report.\n\nAs part of the evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of each business unit, including Head Office, certify compliance with the Group's governance policies and associated risk management and internal control requirements. The Governance function, under the responsibility of the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, facilitates a review of the matters raised in this certification process. This includes the assessment of any risk and control issues reported during the year, risk and control matters identified and reported by the other Group oversight functions and the findings from the reviews undertaken by Group-wide Internal Audit, which carries out risk-based audit plans across the Group. Issues arising from any external regulatory engagement are also taken into account.\n\nFor the purposes of the effectiveness review, the Group has followed the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related/uni00A0Financial and Business Reporting. In line with this guidance, the certification provided does not apply to certain material joint ventures where the Group does not exercise full management control. In these cases, the Group satisfies itself that suitable governance and risk management arrangements are in place to protect the Group's interests. Additionally, the relevant Group company which is party to/uni00A0the joint venture must, in respect of any services it provides in/uni00A0support of the joint venture, comply with the requirements of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's internal governance framework.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Before I highlight some of the key areas of focus during 2020, I would like to thank my predecessor, Paul Manduca, for his chairmanship of the Committee until the end of last year.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee held three meetings, in addition to our three/uni00A0scheduled meetings, to focus on/uni00A0succession planning and the significant progress by Prudential on/uni00A0articulating its ESG strategy and/uni00A0framework.\n\n## Board succession planning\n\nA key aspect of the Committee's role is to ensure that the Board retains an appropriate balance of skills to support the strategic objectives of the Group. As part of this, the Committee helps to maintain a rigorous and transparent approach to the identification of candidates for appointment as Directors.\n\nAs explained in my introduction to the Governance Report, in/uni00A0preparing to take on the role of Chair of the Board and of the Nomination & Governance Committee, an important focus has been/uni00A0on the composition of the Board. The Board has prioritised the identification of individuals with the experience and skills to guide Prudential's transformation into a business focused exclusively on Asia/uni00A0and Africa with strong digital capabilities. In February 2021, following interviews in 2020, we announced that Chua Sock Koong and Ming Lu will join the Board on 1 May 2021. Chua Sock Koong has/uni00A0had a distinguished career, with operations experience in many of/uni00A0our key markets, while Ming Lu has a long track record of investing and growing businesses throughout Asia. We will continue to work in/uni00A02021/uni00A0to ensure that the Board reflects our strategic priorities.\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee also confirmed the appointment of/uni00A0Jeremy Anderson as Chair of the Risk Committee, succeeding Sir/uni00A0Howard.\n\nThe Committee received a detailed update on the process and succession plans in place for members of the Group Executive Committee and was also briefed on the process and initiatives to review and promote talent throughout the Group to develop senior leaders. In addition, the Committee supported Jackson in the creation of a new board prior to the proposed separation of our US business and oversaw the/uni00A0succession planning process at senior management level.\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Diversity and inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen identifying candidates for Board-level succession, the Committee considers primarily what diverse perspectives will contribute to a more robust strategy. Talent search agencies are briefed on the Group's requirements in respect of diversity of thinking as well as ensuring the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience when identifying candidates. Gender and race representation has improved at Board level during 2020, and we continue to look for opportunities for progress in this important area as well as ensuring we/uni00A0have representation from individuals with insights to the geographical markets and businesses linking to the strategic objectives of the Group/uni00A0following the demerger of M&G plc in 2019 and the proposed separation of the US business in 2021.\n\nThe newly established Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group will bring increased focus to the area of diversity, but also inclusion in/uni00A02021: driving a culture where everyone feels valued, treated fairly and respected - enabling them to fully contribute their thoughts and perspectives and to/uni00A0be their authentic selves. This Working Group will assist the Committee and the Board to drive forward its diversity and inclusion agenda, both at Board level, in the executive talent pipeline, and more broadly across the organisation. The Group remains on target to achieve 30 per cent representation of women in senior leadership roles/uni00A0by the end of 2021, in accordance with our commitment to the HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter.\n\nPrudential appointed a Group D&I Director and established a global Diversity & Inclusion Council in 2020, responsible for defining the global D&I strategy, promoting, championing and embedding D&I/uni00A0initiatives and challenging the organisation and leaders where progress is limited. The Working Group will get regular updates on/uni00A0the/uni00A0Diversity & Inclusion Council's activities.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations\n\nThe Committee has focused on Prudential's commitment to being a/uni00A0responsible business. ESG matters have been discussed during all Committee meetings held as part of the usual meeting cycle in 2020 and members have been significantly involved in shaping the ESG Strategic Framework. Committee members have provided feedback at/uni00A0specific points in the year and also met with management ahead of an additional meeting held in October to discuss the framework before it was recommended to the Board for approval.\n\nThe Committee oversaw implementation of the recommendations of/uni00A0the TCFD, including the three work streams that have been established to focus on the main aspects of the Group's exposure to/uni00A0climate-related risks. Prudential became a formal supporter of the/uni00A0TCFD recommendations in December 2018, before the UK government announced in November 2020 that it intends to make it/uni00A0mandatory for large financial institutions to make disclosures in line with the TCFD recommendations by 2025, with other jurisdictions including Hong Kong and Singapore - advancing approaches through/uni00A02020.\n\nIn addition, the Committee received updates on primary ESG-related reporting developments and climate-related risk, and received regular/uni00A0reporting from the newly established executive Group ESG/uni00A0Committee.\n\nThe Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group will also oversee the embedding of Prudential's new ESG Strategic Framework, and will/uni00A0take on employee engagement activities after the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with our recently expanded remit, which now includes oversight/uni00A0of the Board evaluation process, the Committee approved the appointment of Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation to/uni00A0conduct the evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors' effectiveness in respect of 2020. Following the evaluation, the Committee discussed the outcome ahead of the results being discussed with the whole Board, focusing in its discussions on findings relevant to succession planning and diversity.\n\nThe Committee continues to oversee the governance arrangements for the Group's subsidiaries to ensure that they remain appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shriti Vadera\n\nChair of the Nomination & Governance Committee",

These plans are supported and informed by the results of the annual Board evaluation and individual Director evaluations.\n\nSuccession planning includes both longer-term options and emergency cover.\n\nThe Committee takes account of the size, structure and composition of the Board and its Committees, including existing knowledge, experience and diversity. In doing so, the Committee considers the Group's strategic goals and anticipates future requirements in respect of skills and experience.\n\nFollowing the demerger of M&G in 2019, the Committee reviewed the size and composition of the Board to ensure that it/uni00A0remains aligned with strategy. The Committee is now considering the balance of skills and diversity required to/uni00A0support the strategic objectives of the Group following the proposed separation of the US business, in particular pan-Asian operating experience, digital expertise and relevant specialist financial services knowledge.\n\nIn February 2020, the Committee concluded that each of the Directors in office at the time continued to perform effectively and was able to devote appropriate time to fulfil their duties and that collectively, the Board had an appropriate mix of skills and experience for the year under review. The Committee reached the same conclusion in/uni00A0February 2021.\n\nThe Committee considered that the Non-executive Directors continued to demonstrate the desired attributes, contributing effectively to decision-making and exercising sound independent judgement in holding management to/uni00A0account. Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Board those Directors standing for election at the 2021/uni00A0Annual General Meeting. Kai Nargolwala will not stand for election as he has served nine years on the Board.\n\nSuccession planning for Non-executive Directors and the Board's principal Committees ensures the Board is regularly refreshed and maintains appropriate levels of independent challenge to management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe balance of Non-executive and Executive Directors required on the Board is considered on a regular basis, including/uni00A0the overall number, skills and experience. The Committee's succession planning for Non-executive Directors is/uni00A0supported by Egon Zehnder and Spencer Stuart.\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews the membership of all principal Board Committees and makes recommendations to/uni00A0the Board as appropriate.\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee confirmed the appointment of Jeremy Anderson as the Risk Committee Chair, succeeding Sir Howard who retired at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Jeremy joined the Board on 1 January and his biographical details are set out on page 124. The Committee also confirmed its previous recommendation to appoint Shriti Vadera as/uni00A0Chair of the Committee, succeeding Paul Manduca. Shriti Vadera joined the Committee on her appointment in May/uni00A02020 which facilitated her transition to Chair of the Board and of the Committee on 1 January 2021.\n\nWhen making recommendations, the Committee takes account of the current composition of each of the principal Committees, the skills and experience of the members and the strategic objectives of the Group.\n\nSince joining the Board in May 2020, recognising the number of Non-executive Directors reaching the end of their tenure in the next 18 months, Shriti Vadera has led an extensive external recruitment exercise. This was supported by Spencer Stuart, and included Shriti spending time in Hong Kong and Singapore meeting with prospective candidates. As a result of this search Chua Sock Koong and Ming Lu will join the Board on 1 May 2021. These appointments are part of an ongoing process to refresh the Board and make sure it has the right skills and experience to support the Group, in/uni00A0particular pan Asian operating experience, relevant financial services expertise and a high degree of digital familiarity. The next phase of appointments will focus on experience and knowledge of specialist financial services.\n\nThe Committee is engaged in succession planning for the Senior Independent Director, the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and a further Non-executive Director as Philip Remnant, Anthony Nightingale and Alice Schroeder will reach nine years on the Board in 2022.",

Succession plans for the Group Executive Committee were discussed with the Group Chief Executive to identify business requirements and to plan for future succession needs.\n\nSuccession planning for Executive Directors and the Group Executive Committee includes both longer-term planning and emergency cover. Assessment and development for internal candidates is undertaken, in addition to mapping for potential external candidates. Planning for emergency cover is assisted by a broad annual review of talent across the Group and recognises the possible difficulties in identifying and attracting suitable talent on potentially short notice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee received feedback on the performance of each Executive Director from the Group Chief Executive and/uni00A0confirmed the Executive Director succession plans.\n\nDuring 2020 and into 2021, the Committee's work has taken into account the proposed separation of the US business and the consequent shift in priorities and their impact on succession plans. The Committee's discussions are being supported by/uni00A0the Group Human Resources Director, Egon Zehnder and Spencer Stuart.\n\nThe Committee has oversight of a diverse pipeline of leadership talent extending below the level of the Group Executive Committee and seeks to attract, retain and develop the next generation of emerging leadership.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee considered succession planning for senior management below Group Executive Committee level, supported by an annual update on talent and diversity at different levels of the organisation. This includes consideration of risk retention mitigation initiatives such as leadership development programmes.\n\nIn 2020, the focus was on building new capabilities to support the changing business model and future direction of the/uni00A0business. The Committee also oversaw the formation of a new Executive Council to replace the previous 'Top 100 Leadership' group.\n\nIn addition to acting as search consultant in respect of certain executive hires, Egon Zehnder provides support for senior management development assessments.\n\n## Process for appointing new Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in ensuring that there is a formal, rigorous and transparent approach to the appointment of new Directors.\n\nThe Committee is involved from the start when a vacancy or a gap in the Board's skills is identified. Led by the Chair, and working with the Group Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director, a role specification is prepared, reflecting the desired skills and experience and the Group's Diversity and Inclusion Policy. This specification takes into account feedback from the Committee. Once agreed, specialist talent agencies are typically engaged to create a shortlist of candidates which is reviewed by the Committee and other stakeholders. Interviews with individuals then take place with selected Committee members and feedback is provided to all members. In this manner, a/uni00A0preferred candidate is selected and the Committee then recommends the individual to the Board for appointment. For the appointment of/uni00A0Executive Directors, the process is led by the Group Chief Executive working closely with the Chair. The Senior Independent Director leads the Committee in the process of appointing a new Chair.\n\nContemporaneous with this process, due diligence checks are undertaken on the candidate and Prudential liaises with the relevant regulatory authorities. The Committee is kept updated on this process as appropriate.\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The Council is composed of representatives from all business units with the goal to  empower employees and create a sense of belonging by respecting and appreciating differences and deliver the  purpose 'to help people get the most out of life', by creating a culture in which diversity is celebrated and inclusion  assured, for our colleagues, customers and partners.                                    |\n|                                       | As part of the Group's commitment to diversity, Prudential is a signatory to the HM Treasury 'Women in Finance Charter'  which aims to increase the number of women working in senior management in financial services companies. As at  31 December 2020 the percentage of women in senior management was 32 per cent which already exceeds the target  to meet 30 per cent by the end of 2021. For the purposes of Provision 23 of the UK Code, the percentage of women  in/uni00A0senior management positions, including their direct reports, was 30 per cent. |",

Time requirements take account of preparation for and attendance at Board meetings and other regular commitments, as well as additional time that may be required for unforeseen events or future projects.\n\nAll Non-executive Directors currently serve on at least one of the Board's principal Committees, which requires an/uni00A0additional commitment of time dependent on the Committee and role.\n\nFollowing the demerger the Committee carried out a review of the time commitment required of the Non-executive Directors to align to the new structure of Board and Committee meetings. It was concluded that the expected time commitment of 32.5 days per annum remains appropriate. This will be kept under review considering the impact of the/uni00A0pandemic on the operation of the Board and Committees.\n\n## External appointments\n\nThe Committee considers the external commitments of Directors proposed for appointments and all Non-executive Directors confirm on appointment that they are able to devote sufficient time to the Group's affairs to meet the demands of the/uni00A0role.\n\nThe external commitments of Directors were considered when recommending Directors for election at the next AGM. Prudential recognises the need for Non-executive Directors to dedicate sufficient time to their role while also demonstrating an appropriate range of experience and skills through external appointments.\n\nAll Non-executive Directors are required to discuss any additional commitments with the Chair prior to accepting these as they might impact the time which the Director is able to devote to their role. The Chair escalates matters to the Committee as appropriate.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Committee or the Board reviewed time requirements for additional external positions taken on/uni00A0by Directors during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee considers the independence of the Non-executive Directors as required by the UK Code and HK Listing Rules as part of any recommendation of the appointment of new Non-executive Directors and when recommending Non-executive Directors for election.\n\nMonitoring and safeguarding the independence of the Non-executive Directors is essential to comply with their statutory and regulatory obligations. Independence helps ensure effective scrutiny of management and individual Executive Directors against agreed objectives.\n\nEach Non-executive Director provides an annual confirmation of his or her independence as required under the Hong/uni00A0Kong/uni00A0Listing Rules.\n\nAll Non-executive Directors were considered to be independent, taking into account UK and HK requirements. Although Kai Nargolwala has exceeded the nine-year tenure suggested by the UK Corporate Governance Code, he/uni00A0continues to demonstrate independence of judgement. Kai will not offer himself for re-election at the AGM in May.\n\nPrior to recommending their appointments as Non-executive Directors, the Committee considered the independence of Ming Lu and Chua Sock Koong.\n\nThe Committee considered the independence of the Audit Committee members in line with US regulatory requirements, concluding that all members remain independent within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

In what has been a challenging year, I have observed many examples of how the Group has responded to the global pandemic while at the same time continuing to press ahead with strategic change. Throughout, the Committee has continued to provide the Board with assurance as to the integrity of the Group's financial reporting and, together with the Risk Committee, monitor the effectiveness of the second and third lines of defence, which are an even more integral part of our internal control environment at this difficult time.\n\nGood communication has never been more important than in the current circumstances and, as a result, we have added additional meetings to deal with particular issues, such as the accounting implications of the proposed separation and divestment of Jackson, including the/uni00A0accounting of the associated transaction with Athene in/uni00A0June, and/uni00A0the external audit tender. Potential conflicts of interest have been/uni00A0monitored, as they were for the separation of M&G.\n\nCoordination with the Risk Committee has also been important and, while we were disappointed to lose the experience of Sir Howard Davies after his many years of valuable contribution, we were delighted to welcome Jeremy Anderson to the Committee. During the/uni00A0year, Howard, Jeremy and I have agreed the most appropriate Committee to address particular matters, as well as holding a joint Risk/uni00A0and Audit Committee session, as last year, to focus on cyber and/uni00A0information security, to which all Non-executive Directors were/uni00A0invited.\n\nNot surprisingly, throughout 2020 a key focus of the Committee has/uni00A0been the impact of Covid-19 on controls and financial reporting, including key judgements and disclosures. I am pleased to say the Group has responded well to the social-distancing and workingfrom-home measures implemented across all our markets and has carefully considered their effects on key controls and processes. No/uni00A0significant deterioration in the control environment has been observed. The Committee also reflected on any wider control and/uni00A0accounting implications of the change to the Jackson hedge modelling that impacted their statutory capital.\n\nThe introduction of accounting standard IFRS 17, now expected to/uni00A0come into effect in 2023, has also continued to be a significant challenge, given the scope of changes it entails. The Committee received updates during 2020 on external developments and lobbying as the standard was being developed and on the Group's progress towards its implementation.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWe have paid particular attention to our whistleblowing procedures and monitored these for any indicators of issues. I regularly meet privately with the Group Resilience Director to discuss whistleblowing cases and their resolution. These are also discussed in private sessions with the Committee or the relevant local audit committee. During the year, we conducted an external review of the processes and enhanced the governance arrangements.\n\n## External auditor and audit tender\n\nAn important part of the Committee's work consists of overseeing the relationship with the Group's current audit firm KPMG LLP (KPMG), including safeguarding independence, approving non-audit fees and satisfying ourselves that it is in the best interests of shareholders for the Committee to recommend the annual reappointment of KPMG. During the year, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) conducted a/uni00A0review of KPMG's audit of Prudential's financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2019. The Committee was pleased with the outcome, as no significant recommendations for improvement were noted. The KPMG team continues to look at ways it can enhance its audit and challenge of management, something also encouraged by the Committee in its own effectiveness review of KPMG in 2020.\n\nThe Committee discussed with KPMG the impact of Covid-19 on its own business to ensure it had the resources and technology necessary to complete its audit work satisfactorily. We also meet privately with KPMG and I have held a number of meetings with the lead partner team throughout the year. I have also had a review meeting with KPMG's UK Senior Partner.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee oversaw a formal competitive tender process to select an audit firm to succeed KPMG, in accordance with regulatory requirements and FRC guidance.\n\nFollowing regular discussion by the Committee in 2020 and formal evaluation of potential candidates, a shortlist of eligible audit firms were invited to tender and the process concluded with presentations to Committee members in September 2020. Given my former position at PwC, I voluntarily recused myself from the decision-making and asked the Group Chief Internal Auditor to support the audit tender process. Alice Schroeder chaired the final Committee meetings and the presentations by shortlisted candidate firms.\n\nThe Committee was impressed by the quality of each candidate's presentations and team, but, on balance, the Committee determined that, given the Group's future strategic direction, Ernst & Young LLP (EY) was the best fit/uni00A0as/uni00A0the Group's audit firm. The Committee recommended to the Board two firms with a preference that EY be/uni00A0engaged as the Group's audit firm for the year 2023 onwards. The/uni00A0Board approved this recommendation at its meeting in/uni00A0December 2020, subject to future shareholder approval. Further/uni00A0details on the audit tender process are set out in the Audit Tender section at the end/uni00A0of this report.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThroughout 2020, the Committee continued to receive regular briefings from the Group Chief Internal Auditor. Group-wide Internal Audit (GwIA) undertook a programme of risk-based audits covering matters across the business units in addition to assurance work. The work undertaken by GwIA during the year was important in supporting the proposed separation and divestment of Jackson and the control environment of the Group under the revised working conditions.\n\nWe assessed the effectiveness of GwIA and I have met regularly with/uni00A0the Group Chief Internal Auditor and the Group-wide Quality Assurance Director to discuss internal audit work and matters arising. Where particular issues have been raised, management have been invited to Committee meetings to respond. We have monitored resource levels and delivery of and amendments to the audit plan, which by necessity has had to be more flexible than in prior years. Internal Audit have responded well.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong IA replacing the Prudential Regulation Authority as the Group's regulator, a key focus for the Committee during 2020 has been the Group's programme to demonstrate readiness for compliance with the Hong Kong IA's new group-wide supervision framework, effective from the first half of 2021. The Committee has held a number of discussions on the requirements and/uni00A0received proposals for the assurance work that will be needed to/uni00A0demonstrate compliance. I also met privately with the Hong Kong IA/uni00A0during the year.\n\n## Committee governance\n\nFollowing the demerger of M&G plc in October 2019, the Committee was/uni00A0focused on overseeing the development and embedding of new/uni00A0governance arrangements across the Group's Asian business, building direct communication and escalation links with the existing local audit/uni00A0committees of the significant businesses. Regular direct communication with each of the local chairs remains a key component of our governance framework, and I have worked closely with the respective chairs of our significant business unit audit committees during the year. At each meeting, I update the Committee on important points raised at local level, and after the meeting I report to/uni00A0the Board on the main matters discussed.\n\nIn order to foster a close and collegiate working relationship between the Committee and the local audit committees, Jeremy Anderson and/uni00A0I/uni00A0chaired a session attended by all of the non-executive directors at/uni00A0the four major Prudential Corporation Asia businesses.\n\nIn May 2020, we held a private session without the Executives to discuss the results of our 2019 effectiveness evaluation and set the key/uni00A0focus areas for 2020. These included consideration of the impact of Covid-19 on financial matters, the implications of the proposed separation and divestment of Jackson, and the audit tender.\n\nFinally I would like to thank the Committee members for their diligence and contribution throughout the year and management for their responsiveness to challenge and quality of papers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## David Law\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

This has primarily focused on the Annual Report and Accounts but also covers the Group's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, which is now largely replicated in the Annual Report, and the annual update of the Group's published Tax Strategy.\n\nIn reviewing these and other items, the Committee received reports from management and, as appropriate, reports from internal and external assurance providers, which in some cases were provided at the explicit request of the Committee.\n\nWhen considering financial reporting matters, the Committee assesses compliance with relevant accounting standards, regulations and governance codes. No material changes to accounting policies were made during 2020. The Committee continued to receive updates on the Group's plans to implement IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', which are not expected to be effective before 2023. The approach to adopting these standards is further discussed in note A3.2.\n\nThroughout its review of financial reporting matters and disclosure, the Committee considered the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the short-term uncertainties that it has created. Further explanation on the financial impact Covid-19 has had on the business is set out in the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report.\n\nThe following sections set out the key assumptions, judgements and other matters considered as part of their review of/uni00A0the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee reviewed the key assumptions and judgements supporting the Group's IFRS results, including those made in valuing the Group's investments, insurance liabilities and deferred acquisition costs under IFRS, together with reports on the operation of internal controls to derive these amounts. The Committee also reviewed the assumptions underpinning the Group's European Embedded Value (EEV) metrics.\n\n## Assumption setting\n\nThe measurement of insurance liabilities are based on estimates of future cash flows, including those to and from policyholders, over a long period of time. These estimates can, depending on the type of business, be highly judgemental. The Committee considered changes to assumptions and other estimates used to derive IFRS insurance liabilities and for EEV reporting. Peer benchmarking was considered where available alongside current experience. The/uni00A0Committee noted that Covid-19 had not significantly increased the morbidity and mortality claims incurred by the business. The key assumptions reviewed were:\n\n- -Persistency, mortality, morbidity (including expectations of future medical costs inflation and any related premium rises) and expense assumptions within the Asia life businesses;\n- -Policyholder behaviour (eg guaranteed benefit utilisation and persistency) and mortality assumptions affecting the measurement of Jackson guaranteed liabilities (see note C3.3 of the IFRS financial statements); and\n- -Economic assumptions, including investment return and associated risk discount rates, given the current low interest rate environment.\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that the assumptions adopted by management were appropriate. Further information on the effects of material changes to insurance assets and liabilities is included in note C3 to the IFRS financial statements and in the EEV basis results.\n\n## Valuation of investments\n\nThe Committee received information on the carrying value of investments in the Group's balance sheet including information on how those values were calculated for those investments which require more judgement (for example the impairment process for debt securities and commercial loans in the US). Further information on the valuation of assets is/uni00A0contained in note C2 of the IFRS financial statements. The Committee satisfied itself that overall investments were valued appropriately.\n\n## Intangible assets including deferred acquisition costs (DAC)\n\nThe Committee received information to enable it to review the more material intangible asset balances. This included the/uni00A0assumptions that supported the amortisation profile of the DAC balance in the US, as described in note A3.1 'Other/uni00A0items requiring application of critical estimates or judgements' and whether there had been any indication of impairment of the Group's distribution rights assets or goodwill in light of lower sales and increased economic volatility following the Covid-19 pandemic. The Committee was satisfied that there was no impairment of the Group's intangibles at 31 December 2020. Further information is contained in note C4 of the IFRS financial statements.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

It also announced a $500 million equity investment into Jackson by Athene (see note D1.2). The Committee reviewed the accounting for these transactions and the planned market announcement, taking advice from the Group's external advisors. The Committee also reviewed the draft public documents prepared by Jackson and the Group in/uni00A0connection with the proposed separation of Jackson, alongside input provided by the Group's external advisers and/uni00A0auditor.\n\nUS Statutory reporting and changes to hedge modelling as announced to the market on 28 January 2021 The Committee considered in detail the changes to Jackson's hedge modelling for its US statutory results given the impact on the Group's capital management plans for the proposed separation of Jackson. As part of this process, the/uni00A0Committee received the views and recommendations of the Jackson Audit Committee and management and the reports and conclusions of the external advisers who had reviewed the model and tested the revised output. They also considered any implications on the Group financial reporting, noting that there was no direct impact on IFRS reporting and that a consequential refinement of the method to project future hedge costs for EEV was planned for the FY20 results, as discussed in note 2 (iv) (b) of the EEV financial statements.\n\n## Going concern and viability statements\n\nThe Committee considered various analyses from management regarding the Group's and the parent company's capital and liquidity position taking into account the Group's principal risks. This included scenarios assessing the impact on the/uni00A0Group's plan of different new business levels depending on the length of time Covid-19 restrictions remain in place, as well as stress scenarios which assume a deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. It also considered scenarios which both included and excluded the proposed separation of Jackson. Following this review, it recommended to the Board that it/uni00A0could conclude that the financial statements should continue to be prepared on the going-concern basis and that the disclosures on the Group's longer-term viability were both reasonable and appropriate.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable requirement\n\nThe Committee carried out a formal review of whether the Annual Report and Accounts were 'fair, balanced and/uni00A0understandable' as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. In particular, they considered whether the/uni00A0report gave a full picture of the Group's business model, strategy and performance in the year, with important messages appropriately highlighted. They also considered the level of consistency between financial statements and/uni00A0narrative sections, whether performance measures were clearly explained and the prominence of alternative performance measures.\n\nAfter completion of its detailed review, the Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Group's Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Committee regularly received updates on the Group's tax matters and provisions for certain open tax items, including tax matters in litigation. The Committee was satisfied that the level of provisioning adopted by management was appropriate. See notes B4 and C7 of the IFRS financial statements.\n\n## Parent company financial statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed the parent company profit and loss account and balance sheet, which includes the recoverability of the parent company's investment in subsidiaries by assessing and confirming that the net assets of the relevant subsidiaries (being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount) were in excess of their carrying value at the balance sheet date and that those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.",

The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the audit throughout the year taking into account:\n\n- -The detailed audit strategy for the year, approach to risk assessment and coverage of the audit response to highlighted significant risks;\n- -Group materiality and how that is applied to the individual business units;\n- -Insight around the key accounting judgements, including benchmarking, and the way KPMG applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in dealing with management;\n- -The outcome of management's internal evaluation of the auditor as discussed below; and\n- -Other external evaluations of KPMG, with a focus on the FRC's annual quality review.\n\nThere is an open dialogue on emerging risks and issues between the Group Lead Partner and Committee members via/uni00A0a/uni00A0regular schedule of meetings aligned to key reporting milestones. The Committee formally met with the Group Lead Partner without management present.\n\nInternal evaluation of KPMG was conducted using a questionnaire survey that was circulated to the Committee members, independent members of the business unit audit committees, the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer and the Group's senior financial leadership for completion. A key component of the evaluation was the/uni00A0degree of challenge and robustness of approach to the audit. The survey asked 29 questions over four categories (audit quality and execution, team performance, process and communication) in relation to the 2019 audit.\n\nKPMG were given the opportunity to respond to the findings in the reports and where necessary, proposed enhancements to the audit process and team.\n\n## FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR)\n\nThe FRC's AQR team carried out a review of KPMG's audit of Prudential's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. This included discussions with the Chair of the Committee. Following completion of the AQR, the/uni00A0Committee was provided with a Review Report from the FRC's AQR team. The Committee was pleased to note that/uni00A0no significant recommendations were made by the FRC for further improvement and a number of areas of good practice were highlighted.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The Policy is updated annually and approved by the Committee. It sets out the circumstances in which the external auditor may be permitted to undertake non-audit services and is based on four key principles which specify that the auditor should not:\n\n- -Have a mutual or conflicting interest with the Group;\n- -Audit its own firm's work;\n- -Act as management or employees for the Group; or\n- -Be put in a position of being an advocate for the Group.\n\nThe Policy has two permissible service types: those that require specific approval by the Committee on an engagement basis and those that are pre-approved by the Committee with an annual monetary limit capped at no more than 5 per cent of the Group audit fee in the proposed year and capped at $65,000 individually. Effective from 2020, the/uni00A0policy also provides that the total fees payable to KPMG for non-audit services, other than those required by law or/uni00A0regulation, shall be limited to no more than 70 per cent of the average audit fees paid in the past three consecutive financial years. In accordance with the Policy, the Committee approved these permissible services, classified as either audit or non-audit services, and monitored the usage of the annual limits on a quarterly basis. Non-audit services undertaken by KPMG were agreed prior to the commencement of work and were confirmed as permissible for the external auditor to undertake in accordance with the Policy which complies with the rules and regulations of the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).\n\nThe Committee monitored the nature and extent of non-audit services on a regular basis to ensure the provision of non-audit services complied with the Group's policy and did not impair the auditor's objectivity or independence. The/uni00A0Committee noted that KPMG typically only performed non-audit services where they complemented its role as external auditor, for example the review of half year and EEV financial statements or additional assurance to support capital market requirements. This work has by necessity been significant as a result of the demerger of M&G in the prior/uni00A0year and the proposed separation of Jackson. It is not however considered to detract from the objectivity and independence of KPMG due to the nature of the work and the involvement of separate teams.\n\nIn keeping with professional ethical standards, KPMG also confirmed its independence to the Committee and set out the/uni00A0supporting evidence for their conclusion in a report that was considered by the Committee prior to publication of/uni00A0the/uni00A0financial results.\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor developments to ensure the Group's policies and processes around audit effectiveness and independence evolve in line with market practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe fees paid to KPMG for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to $16.0 million (2019: $30.4 million) of which $1.0 million (2019: $13.2 million) was total amounts payable in respect of non-audit services, except those required by law and regulation, as defined by the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019). A breakdown of the fees payable to KPMG can be found in note B2.4 to the IFRS financial statements.\n\nIn 2019, $7.3 million of the $13.2 million spent on non-audit services, excluding those required by law and regulation was/uni00A0for one-off services associated with the demerger of M&G plc. Excluding these one-off fees in 2019, total non-audit service fees that are subject to non-audit fee cap were $5.9 million compared with $3.8 million in 2020. The decrease in 2020 primarily reflects a reduction in the level of elective regulatory disclosure work no longer being required. The/uni00A0ratio of non-audit fees for the Group in 2020 over the average of audit fees for the past three years is 28 per cent for/uni00A0the Group, 42 per cent below the 70 per cent cap set by the FRC.\n\nIn all these cases, the audit firm was considered the most appropriate to carry out the work, given its knowledge of the Group and the synergies that arise from running these engagements alongside its main audit.\n\nAll non-audit services were pre-approved by the Committee and were in line with the Policy discussed above.\n\nBased on the outcome of the effectiveness evaluation and all other considerations, the Committee concluded that there was nothing in the performance of the auditor which would require a change. The Committee therefore recommended that KPMG be reappointed as the auditor. A resolution to this effect will be proposed to shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting.",

The review identified specific areas for improvement and the necessary actions that have been, or are being, taken. The/uni00A0Committee considered in particular the changes made to US statutory reporting as announced on 28 January and/uni00A0the actions taken, including an independent review by external advisers of the revised model. They also took the/uni00A0opportunity to consider with management the existing reviews and controls around model changes more widely, including in Asia. Alongside the review carried out by management, the Committee considered that enhanced governance over the more material Asian subsidiaries as previously discussed was providing them with deeper insight, as were the projects to prepare for GWS and IFRS 17.\n\nThe Committee noted the comparatively low rating for audit and risk governance within the Governance QualityScore issued by Institutional Shareholder Services and satisfied itself that this reflected historic matters that were the subject of/uni00A0the FCA's fine of The Prudential Assurance Company Limited in September 2019, pre the demerger, rather than any broader concerns about the Company's governance arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group Governance Manual sets out the policies and procedures by which the Group operates within its framework of internal governance, taking into account relevant statutory and regulatory matters.\n\nIncorporating our Group Code of Business Conduct, the Group Governance Manual sets out the general principles by/uni00A0which we conduct our business and ourselves.

        "page_content": "## Audit tender in 2020\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe Prudential Group's Annual Report 2018 noted the Group's intention to commence a tender process to appoint a new auditor in line with the UK Code in respect of audit tendering and European rules on mandatory audit rotation. The external audit tender resulted in the proposal, subject to shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM, to appoint EY as the Prudential external auditor for the financial year 2023.\n\nThe process ran from November 2019 to December 2020, was led by/uni00A0the Committee and was in compliance with statutory requirements and guidance issued by the FRC.\n\n## 2.  Governance\n\nThe objective of the audit tender was to select the best audit firm to/uni00A0provide a high quality, effective and efficient audit in succession to/uni00A0KPMG, recognising the business lines and geographical spread of/uni00A0the/uni00A0organisation. To ensure a transparent and robust selection and evaluation process, the Committee assumed responsibility for leading the tender process and recommending the preferred firm to the Board.\n\nPrior to commencing the audit tender, two potential conflicts of interest were specifically recognised. These related to the Chair of the/uni00A0Committee's former positions and pension from PwC and the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's former position and pension from Deloitte. To mitigate the risk the Group Chief Internal Auditor was asked to support the audit tender process. In addition, with the Committee's agreement, the Chair recused himself from the final decision and asked Alice Schroeder to chair those meetings at which decisions regarding the tender were made.\n\n## 3.  Participants\n\nFive firms were approached (three from the 'Big Four' and two 'challenger' firms). The two challenger firms chose not to take part in/uni00A0the process due to resources and strategic focus. Request for Information (RFI) letters were issued to the remaining candidate firms in November 2019. EY and PwC responded positively, confirming their intention to commit to the tender process and that they could meet the independence requirements. Deloitte noted potential independence concerns and subsequently withdrew from the process as they did not believe these could be resolved.\n\n## 4. Scope of tender\n\nThe audit tender was designed to select the Prudential Group's external auditor, as well as the auditor for the business units across the group. The audit tender acknowledged that certain local companies within the Group had separate auditor rotation requirements.\n\n## 5.  Independence\n\nFirms were asked to confirm that they would be able to demonstrate how independence would be achieved by no later than 31 December 2021, in accordance with the FRC Revised Ethical Standard 2019 and PCAOB auditing and related professional practice standards. In response, the/uni00A0firms confirmed their ability to assert their independence by 31 December 2021 and set out how this would be achieved in respect of:\n\n- -Current engagements (non-audit services) with Prudential;\n- -Prudential's management of the firm's investments and investments Prudential may hold in the firm;\n- -Internal procedures for dealing with the personal independence of/uni00A0the firm's partners, former partners and staff (in respect of direct investments, pensions of former partners and pensions held); and -Other current business relationships with Prudential.\n\nPrudential is satisfied that the required independence of the audit firm can be achieved.\n\n## 6. Selection criteria\n\nIn order to codify what was required of the firms, a transparent set of/uni00A0selection criteria was devised and incorporated in scorecards used to evaluate the firms' proposals and presentations:\n\n- -Core requirements - the standards candidate firms were required to/uni00A0demonstrate to enable them to fulfil the audit of all in-scope business units within the Group; and\n- -Further differentiators - criteria designed to assist in distinguishing between the candidate firms should there be no clear difference based on the core requirements.\n\nThe selection criteria also took account of local qualification requirements to ensure that these were able to be satisfied.\n\n## 7. Access to information\n\nIn order to ensure a level playing field (ie a fair, open and transparent tender process), between June and September 2020 both firms were given access to management and key stakeholders across the Group in/uni00A0order to help them understand the business and better tailor their proposals. These meetings included the Head Office locations and the/uni00A0principal business units. The information received by the candidate firms from/uni00A0these visits was supplemented with the provision of additional information made available through a virtual data room to/uni00A0ensure both/uni00A0firms had the same information.\n\n## 8. Evaluation activities\n\nThe following activities were conducted to assess the firms and inform evaluation against each of the evaluation criteria:\n\n- -Written proposals - Prepared for the Group and principal business/uni00A0units.\n- -Formal assessed presentations - To the Audit Committee in Jackson/uni00A0National Life Insurance Company and Jackson National Asset Management, to Group Finance and a presentation to a panel/uni00A0in Prudential Corporation Asia which included the audit committee chairs of the Hong Kong and Singapore life businesses.\n- -Meetings with chief finance officers of local business units in Asia/uni00A0and Africa - To assess the firm's capability in local markets and/uni00A0their ability to perform the role of local statutory auditor.\n- -Technical case studies - Both firms participated in an exercise to/uni00A0help assess how they would work with Prudential on a technical/uni00A0matter.\n- -Technology demonstration - These events gave both firms the opportunity to set out their technology and innovation strategy and/uni00A0how this could enhance the quality of the audit; and\n- -Formal Presentations to the Committee - A summary of the assessments from the above process was presented to the Committee in advance of final formal presentations.\n\n## 9. Evaluation\n\nThe Committee recommended both EY and PwC to the Board and considered both able to conduct a high quality audit of the Group. The/uni00A0Committee identified a first and second choice, and at its meeting on 3 December 2020 the Board resolved that it intends to recommend EY for appointment for the year ending 31 December 2023, subject to/uni00A0shareholders' approval at the AGM in 2023. In making this decision, the Board noted that EY had particularly differentiated themselves with/uni00A0the Asian experience of their team.\n\n## 10. Transition\n\nKPMG will remain the Group's auditor until 2023. Over the intervening period EY and the Group will start the transition process, including independence in respect of non-audit services and other business relationships globally and preparation for the introduction of revised accounting procedures IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.",

It was certainly an eventful year to step into the role, with the Committee considering key strategic and externally driven changes that will leave an indelible mark/uni00A0on the Group's operations into the future. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor, Howard Davies, who has served as a Non-executive Director and chaired the Committee since October 2010, for his outstanding contribution. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members and everyone on/uni00A0the Prudential team who supported me in my transition to Chair.\n\n## Committee operation\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in providing leadership, direction and/uni00A0oversight of the Group's overall risk appetite, limits and strategy. It/uni00A0also oversees and advises the Board on current and future risk exposures of/uni00A0the Group, including those which have the potential to impact on the/uni00A0delivery of the Group's Business Plan. The Committee reviews the/uni00A0Group Risk Framework and recommends changes to it for approval by the Board to ensure that it remains effective in identifying and managing the risks faced by the Group. The Committee received regular reports from the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, who is advised by the Group Executive Risk Committee (GERC). I/uni00A0provided feedback on the performance of the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer to the Group Chief Executive as part of the annual evaluation of the Board and its members. The Committee also received regular reports from the Group-wide Internal Audit function and updates from other areas of the business as needed.\n\nThe risk governance arrangements for the Group's major businesses were delayered and strengthened in 2020 with the implementation of/uni00A0direct lines of communication, reporting and oversight of the risk committees of these businesses by the Committee. To support the enactment of these arrangements, the terms of reference for the major business unit risk committees were aligned and approved locally and include a standing invitation for the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and Group Chief Executive and the requirement for relevant risk escalations directly to the Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Covid-19 risks and responses\n\nAs the Covid-19 crisis started to take hold at the start of the year the Group responded incisively. An additional meeting of the Committee was convened in March to consider the potential impacts and disruption to the Group's people, customers and service delivery and to its solvency, liquidity position and credit risk exposures. At the same meeting the Committee reviewed and approved a recalibration to the Group's Economic Capital (ECap) solvency risk appetite target given the evident shift in the position in the economic cycle triggered by the/uni00A0pandemic. High cadence monitoring, with a focus on solvency and/uni00A0liquidity risks to the Group, was performed through a series of meetings of the Critical Incident Group (CIG), invoked by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer under the Group's Critical Incident Procedures. Key updates from the CIG meetings were provided to the/uni00A0Committee.\n\nIn addition to the operational and market impact of Covid-19, the pandemic has accelerated digital adoption at the Group's agency business and increased the user base of Prudential's digital health application Pulse. Increased digitalisation was an emerging focus during 2020 and will remain a prominent theme in 2021. For the remainder of the year, the Committee also considered changes to the Group's sales processes (including the rollout of virtual face-to-face sales processes across its markets and associated regulatory and conduct risk implications) and the impact to sales, claims, lapses and surrenders. The Committee also monitored the operational resilience of the business and its key third parties as well as its information security posture and cyber defence capabilities amidst the crisis.\n\n## Regulatory matters\n\nTo align Hong Kong's regulatory regime with international standards and practices, the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA) has developed a new group-wide supervision (GWS) framework for multinational insurance groups under its supervision. On 24 July 2020 the Insurance (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance, being the enabling primary legislation providing for the GWS Framework, was enacted. This primary legislation is supported by subsidiary legislation and guidance material from the Hong Kong IA. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will also come into operation on 29 March 2021. The GWS framework is expected to become effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second half of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements. The framework is based on a/uni00A0principle-based and outcome-focused approach and allows the Hong/uni00A0Kong IA to exercise direct regulatory powers over the holding companies of multinational insurance groups, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a preferred base for large insurance groups in Asia Pacific and as a global insurance hub. During 2020, the Hong Kong IA engaged with the Group and other relevant stakeholders in the development of/uni00A0the GWS framework, which will be anchored on the/uni00A0requirements for three pillars: capital, risk and governance, and disclosure. Prior to the GWS framework becoming effective, the Group remains subject to/uni00A0the Regulatory Letter signed with the Hong Kong IA, which outlines the interim supervision arrangements from October 2019 when it became the Group-wide supervisor of the Group.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has received regular updates from the/uni00A0Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer on GWS developments as well as compliance with the existing regime and the Group's preparation for the implementation of the new framework.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer briefed the Committee regularly on developments in systemic risk regulation and the Insurance Capital Standards (ICS). We/uni00A0considered the Group's FY 2019 ICS results, including the results from the 2020 data collection exercise and the latest developments in/uni00A0the Standards in December. Many of the policy requirements that/uni00A0resulted from the Group's prior designation in/uni00A02016 as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII) have been adopted into the/uni00A0Insurance Core Principles (ICPs) and the Common Framework (ComFrame). The Committee therefore considered and approved the/uni00A0Group's 2020 Systemic Risk Management Plan, Liquidity Risk Management Plan and Recovery Plan.\n\n## Transformation risk, including the proposed Jackson separation, and other in-depth reviews\n\nDuring 2020, a key area of consideration for the Committee was the risks associated with the Group's key strategic change initiatives, which included the Athene reinsurance and equity injection transactions and the Group's digital transformation, as well as those/uni00A0related to IFRS 17 and LIBOR transition. The Committee also considered risk opinions related to the financial and non-financial risks to the execution of the/uni00A0Jackson separation strategy and reviewed the risk disclosures within key in-progress transaction documentation, including those for/uni00A0the Prudential plc shareholder Circular and Jackson's Form 10 Information Statement.\n\nIn-depth reviews were performed on existing and emerging high-risk areas including the risks related to the Group's insurance products in/uni00A0Asia and Africa; the product portfolio at Prudential Life Thailand; and the actions for managing the risks from historically low interest rates during the year in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The/uni00A0latter review formed part of a series of work considering the long-term impact of lower interest rates on product profitability and local business unit solvency. Following a 2019 deep dive review performed on Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence (AI), a/uni00A0number of/uni00A0developments resulting from the review were considered by the Committee during 2020. This included progress updates on the/uni00A0development of AI governance and Ethics Principles for the Group.\n\n## Risk appetite and principal risks\n\nThe Committee performed its regular review of the Group's risk policies and proposed changes to the Group risk appetite statements. Aligned with these reviews, proposals to amend associated limits were/uni00A0also considered. The Committee reviewed the Group's annual ORSA report in May, and in light of the change in the Group's risk profile following the Athene transactions and the changes in the economic environment driven by the pandemic, an interim refreshed ORSA update was reviewed by the Committee in September. In/uni00A0addition to the frequent monitoring performed during the most acute phases of the market turmoil in the first half of 2020, we regularly reviewed the strength of our capital and liquidity positions (including the results of stress and scenario analyses) under the Hong Kong IA's Local Capital Summation Method (LCSM) to assess the resilience of/uni00A0the buffer above the Group's regulatory capital requirements.\n\nThe Committee also considered the principal risks facing the Group/uni00A0and received updates on these through the course of the year, as well as reports from the risk committee chairs of the Group's major businesses, with the chief risk officers of Prudential Corporation Asia/uni00A0and Jackson regularly attending Committee meetings. A fuller explanation of principal risks facing the Group and the way in which the Group manages these is set/uni00A0out in the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's report on pages 45 to 69. During 2020, the/uni00A0Committee considered risk assessments and opinions on key areas/uni00A0covering the risks associated with the Group's Business Plan and/uni00A0executive remuneration.",

        "page_content": "In respect of our principal risks, we continued to focus on the risks to the Group's financial viability and non-financial sustainability. This includes those arising from the external business and macroeconomic environment in which the Group operates, including the implications of sustained low interest rates; risks arising from the nature of the Group's business and industry; risks around global legal and regulatory compliance; and environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks. In May 2020, a joint session with the Audit Committee on cyber security included an update on the Group-wide response to Covid-19 related cyber security risks, as well as progress updates on the Group's/uni00A0Privacy Programme and the standardised Information Security Programme across the businesses. The Committee approved a global set of ethics principles for artificial intelligence and complex tools (forming part of the Group Code of Business Conduct) in May, and in/uni00A0December was provided a progress update on the development of/uni00A0the governance in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee convened an additional meeting in September focusing on ESG risks, in particular climate-related transition risk for the Group's invested assets. Aligned to the strategic focus by the Group on its purpose, culture and values and the adoption of People & Culture as one of the Group's principal risks at the beginning of 2020, the Committee considered how the Group's culture initiative and purpose could be applied to support sound risk management practice, behaviours, conduct and awareness. In December 2020, after a successful period of road-testing, the Committee approved a new Group Customer Conduct Risk Policy.\n\n## Committee governance\n\nThe Committee works closely with the Audit Committee to ensure both Committees are updated and aligned on matters of common interest. Where responsibilities are perceived to overlap between the/uni00A0two Committees, David Law and I agree the most appropriate Committee to consider the matter. Aligned with the consolidation of/uni00A0the Risk, Compliance and Security functions under the leadership of/uni00A0the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer during 2019, the Committee assumed responsibility for/uni00A0Compliance oversight from the Audit Committee with effect from 1 January 2020. The Committee considered and approved the Risk and Compliance plans for the year.\n\nFollowing the demerger of M&G in October 2019, the Committee was/uni00A0focused on overseeing the development and embedding of new governance arrangements across the Group's Asian business, building direct communication and escalation links with the existing local risk committees of the significant businesses. Regular direct communication with each of the local chairs remains a key component of our governance framework, and I have worked closely with the respective chairs of our significant business unit risk committees during the year. At each meeting, I update the Committee on important points raised at/uni00A0local level, and after the meeting I report to the Board on the main matters discussed.\n\nIn order to foster a close and collegiate working relationship at the Committee and with the local audit committees, David Law and I/uni00A0chaired a session attended by all of the non-executive directors at/uni00A0the/uni00A0four major Prudential Corporation Asia businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeremy Anderson\n\nChair of the Risk Committee\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

As part of its role in overseeing and advising the Board on future risk exposures and strategic risks, the Committee  reviewed the risk assessment of the Business Plan, which included key financial risks (including those associated with  the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, being more uncertain than those foreseen in previous  Plan assessments, and including prolonged low interest rates) and non-financial risks (including the execution risks in  delivering the Group's announced strategy for Jackson; risks to top-line sales growth and increasing third party risk).  The/uni00A0analysis review included sensitivity assessments of the impact of various plausible scenarios. The ORSA is a key ongoing process for identifying, assessing, controlling, monitoring and reporting the risks to which  the Group is exposed and assessing capital adequacy over the business planning horizon. |\n| Assessment   (ORSA)                        | In May, the Committee considered the Group's ORSA report, based on the Business Plan, prior to its approval by the  Board.

In April 2020, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need for continued restraint in executive remuneration, the/uni00A0Committee clarified how we intended to operate the new policy, as/uni00A0described in the 'Aligning pay and performance in the context of Covid-19' section of this report. These clarifications included reversing salary increases awarded for 2020, reducing pension benefits of incumbent Executive Directors from 25 per cent to 13 per cent of salary in line with the UK workforce and reversing the proposed increase in the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan (PLTIP) award level/uni00A0for the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer./uni00A0The/uni00A02020 Directors' remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM with 95.8 per cent votes cast in favour. During 2021, the Committee intends to operate within the 2020 policy and in line with our previous clarifications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs described below, a number of changes are planned in the application of the policy for 2021 to maintain the strong connection between incentive arrangements and the Group's evolving strategy. I have had the/uni00A0opportunity during late 2020 and early 2021 to discuss these changes with many of our major shareholders, as well as the organisations that represent and advise them. I am pleased to say that we have had the benefit of substantive feedback from over 40 per cent of our shareholder register and that the majority of shareholders and advisory bodies who provided input are supportive of the remuneration arrangements that we/uni00A0proposed for 2021. These arrangements are in line with our approved 2020 remuneration policy. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the shareholders and advisory bodies for their engagement to date and look forward to continuing this useful dialogue into the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reflecting 2020 financial performance\n\nPrudential's executive remuneration arrangements reward the achievement of Group, business, functional and personal targets, provided that this performance is delivered within the Company's risk/uni00A0framework and appetites, and that the conduct expectations of/uni00A0Prudential, our regulators and other stakeholders are met.",

This reflected the change in geographical sales mix, most notably the fall in Hong Kong APE, as a result of the challenging trading environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This result was below the minimum threshold.\n\nOperating free surplus generation was 1 per cent higher than 2019 on an actual exchange rate basis (and on a constant exchange rate basis) and/uni00A0this result was above the approved stretch target.\n\nBusiness units remittance levels were 47 per cent lower than 2019 and were below minimum threshold. Holding company cash was $1.5 billion at/uni00A0the/uni00A0year end, after dividends, corporate costs and strategic investment in Asia, though, reflecting the lower level of remittances received from/uni00A0the business units, the Group cash flow measure was below the minimum threshold level.\n\nThe Group achieved these results while maintaining appropriate levels of capital and while operating within the Group's risk framework and/uni00A0appetites in the challenging market environment.\n\n## Reflecting stakeholders' 2020 experiences\n\nIn reaching its decisions for 2020, the Committee considered the experience of the Company's stakeholder groups, particularly in the context of/uni00A0the pandemic. More details can be found in the ESG section of the Strategic report:\n\n## Investors\n\n- -At the half year, the Company announced a change in the dividend/uni00A0policy, aligned with the revised Group strategy to focus on/uni00A0value creation through growth. Dividends are expected to grow/uni00A0broadly in line with the growth in Asia and will be set taking into account financial prospects, investment opportunities and market conditions.\n- -While the Company's share price reduced by 7 per cent during 2020, our one-year TSR performance has been stronger than our comparators, outperforming the median of the 2020 PLTIP peer group (Prudential, (8.6) per cent compared with the peer group median of (12.5) per cent on a point to point basis).\n- -On 28 January 2021, Prudential announced that it was considering an equity raise of around $2.5-3 billion to increase financial flexibility and take advantage of Asia growth opportunities.\n\n## Governments and Regulators\n\n- -Group has not sought any government support during the pandemic. A job support payment inadvertently received from one/uni00A0government was repaid in full.\n- -The Group has engaged frequently with its Lead Regulator on/uni00A0the/uni00A0development of the proposed Group-wide Supervision (GWS)/uni00A0framework which is expected to become effective from/uni00A0March 2021.\n\n## Customers\n\n- -Customer service processes made claiming easier with dedicated hotlines, fast-track claims processing and policy premium grace period extensions.\n- -Free limited-time Covid-19 cover was offered in Asia and the 'Pulse/uni00A0by Prudential' app put artificial intelligence-powered medical/uni00A0symptom checking, wellness advice and tele-medicine into/uni00A0people's hands.\n- -A total of $4.2 million was spent on goodwill payments.\n\n## Our people\n\n- -Almost all employees have spent at least part of 2020 working remotely, in line with local restrictions and guidance.\n- -No employees were furloughed or made redundant as a result of the pandemic. Our remuneration programmes operated as usual during the pandemic period with medical insurance coverage extended to offer free Covid testing where necessary. Employees received their regular remuneration during any periods of shielding or self-isolation.\n- -In July 2020 the Global Diversity & Inclusion Council was established to empower employees and create a sense of belonging by respecting and appreciating differences.\n- -A range of initiatives was launched to support employees' wellbeing and mental health, including the Group's first global wellbeing day held on World Mental Health day.\n\n## Suppliers\n\n- -All London Head Office suppliers with fewer than 100 employees were automatically switched to 10-day payment terms.\n- -Human rights and modern slavery considerations are embedded across all supplier and supply chain arrangements.\n\n## Society\n\n- -The Group created a $2.5 million Covid-19 relief fund.\n- -The Prudence Foundation Safe Steps Covid-19 campaign provided practical advice about safety in the pandemic and reached over 250 million people daily across Asia and 80 million people a month across Africa.\n- -Significant progress was made in redefining the Group's ESG ambition and strategy including the creation of the Responsibility and/uni00A0Sustainability Working Party of the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Rewarding 2020 performance\n\nThe Committee determined remuneration outcomes having considered the financial performance of the Group, its delivery to/uni00A0stakeholders and the personal contribution of executives.\n\nAs set out above, 2020 saw the Group perform well against its key operating profit and operating free surplus generation targets in the face of difficult external conditions. This performance, combined with his effective personal leadership, resulted in an overall bonus outcome for Mr Wells of 66 per cent of his maximum opportunity. However, the/uni00A0Committee and Mr Wells recognised the impact on investors of elements of the Group's announcement on 28 January 2021 with respect to Jackson and the Committee exercised its discretion to reduce Mr Wells's 2020 bonus outcome by 30 per cent (from 66 to 46 per cent of his maximum opportunity).\n\nThe Committee believes that the bonuses it awarded to the other Executive Directors for 2020 (between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of/uni00A0executives' maximum Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) opportunities) appropriately reflect underlying Company performance, individual and/or functional performance and wider factors.\n\nOver the longer term, the Group has demonstrated positive operating results delivering total cumulative adjusted operating profits of $18,472 million in the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years. Based on this strong cumulative adjusted operating profit performance over the/uni00A0period and performance against our sustainability scorecard, the/uni00A0Committee determined that 68.75 per cent of the Prudential Long/uni00A0Term Incentive Plan (PLTIP) awards made to Executive Directors in 2018 would vest. These awards will be released to participants from/uni00A0April 2021, but remain subject to a two-year post-performance holding period. The portion of the awards related to Prudential's total shareholder return (TSR) lapsed as TSR performance was ranked below the median of the peer group.\n\nThe total 2020 remuneration or 'single figure' for the Group Chief Executive, Mike Wells, is 11 per cent lower than his total restated 2019 'single figure', notwithstanding his exceptional leadership and personal performance. This chiefly reflects the reduction in the value of his 2020 bonus and the decrease in the pension contribution from 25 per cent to 13 per cent of salary.\n\n## Preparing for the intended separation and divestment of Jackson\n\nAs the Group prepares for the proposed separation and divestment of/uni00A0the Jackson business, the Committee established a set of principles to underpin decisions on remuneration relating to the separation, including:\n\n- -Executives should not be advantaged or disadvantaged by the separation;\n- -The value of outstanding awards and their key terms (vesting dates, holding periods, malus and clawback provisions) should be unaffected;\n- -If performance conditions are revised, the new conditions should be no more or less stretching than those originally attached to the/uni00A0awards; and\n- -Where the Committee has applied discretion, this will be clearly/uni00A0disclosed.\n\nThese principles are consistent with those adopted in respect of the/uni00A02019 demerger of the M&G business and will be the basis for the/uni00A0decisions which will be taken by the Committee and disclosed in/uni00A0due course, including the treatment of outstanding share awards.\n\n## D P R\n\n## Engaging shareholders on 2021 remuneration arrangements\n\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, we consulted with our major shareholders and the main institutional voting agencies on the proposed implementation of our Directors' remuneration policy in 2021. We had constructive conversations about our approach to remuneration and received broad support for our proposals, as summarised below:\n\n- -We proposed rebalancing the AIP metrics for 2021 with an increased weight assigned to the EEV new business profit, in line with our strategy of driving growth in profitable new business.\n- -On the PLTIP, we proposed that RoEV replaces the RoE measure for/uni00A02021 awards to reflect the focus on achieving sustained growth in embedded value per share while the TSR peer group is revised to/uni00A0reflect the footprint of the post-separation Group. These changes ensure the strong alignment of remuneration structures with the Group's strategic priorities.\n- -The Committee has taken the decision not to award salary increases to Executive Directors for 2021. Details of the proposed operation of the incentive plans in 2021 are included in the 'Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2021' section. 2021 will be the ninth consecutive year in which the increases generally offered to executives have been below or close to the bottom of the/uni00A0salary increase budget ranges for the broader workforce.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, non-financial incentive measures included a shared annual ESG objective and the Conduct and Diversity elements in the Sustainability Scorecard. Looking further ahead, I anticipate that the Group's renewed focus on measuring its ESG impact (described in our/uni00A0ESG Report) may result in further ESG measures being used within the Company's incentive plans. This is something that the Committee has considered and that I have discussed with shareholders. The Committee will take advice from the newly established Responsibility and Sustainability Working Party about how we might develop robust and stretching incentive targets which are meaningfully connected with the Group's ESG strategy.\n\nI trust that you will find this report a clear account of the way in which/uni00A0the Committee has implemented the Directors' remuneration policy during 2020 and of the proposed Directors' remuneration arrangements for 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Anthony Nightingale, CMG SBS JP\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n2 March 2021\n\nw\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nt\n\ns\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of long-term incentive awards, as set out in the Annual report on remuneration.\n\nThe value of the performance-related elements of remuneration is added to the fixed packages provided to Executive Directors to calculate the/uni00A02020 'single figure' of total remuneration. The total 2020 'single figure' for the Group Chief Executive is 11 per cent less than the total 2019 'single figure'. This chiefly reflects the reduction in the value of his 2020 bonus and the decrease in the pension contribution from 25 per cent to/uni00A013 per cent of salary.

Nevertheless, in light of the challenges presented by Covid-19 and the need for continued restraint in executive remuneration, in April 2020 Prudential's Executive Directors proposed the following changes to their remuneration, which were accepted by the/uni00A0Remuneration Committee:\n\n- -A reduction in the salaries of Executive Directors to the level on 31 December 2019, reversing the 2 per cent salary increase with effect from 1 April 2020.\n- -A reduction in the pension benefits of incumbent Executive Directors from 25 per cent to 13 per cent of salary, with effect from 14 May 2020, a/uni00A0level in line with the employer pension contribution available to the UK workforce.\n- -The Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's 2020 PLTIP award was maintained at 250 per cent instead of moving to the level of 300 per cent of salary provided by the policy.\n\nIn recognition of the continued focus on pay restraint and after due deliberation, the Committee considered there should be no salary increases for the Executive Directors for 2021. The factors taken into account by the Committee when determining that the pay freeze should apply included treatment of all Company stakeholders and pay fairness. 2021 will be the ninth consecutive year in which the increases generally offered to executives have been below or close to the bottom of the salary increase budget ranges for the broader workforce.\n\nRemuneration packages for 2021, effective 1 January 2021, are set out in detail in the Annual report on remuneration and are summarised below:\n\n|                    |                                                                   |                              |                      | Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)   | Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)   |                              |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Executive Director | Role                                                              | 2021 salary (Local currency) | 2021 salary  (USD) 1 | Maximum bonus (% of salary)   | Bonus deferred (% of bonus)   | PLTIP award  (% of salary) 2 |\n| Mark FitzPatrick   | Group Chief Financial Officer  and/uni00A0Chief Operating Officer | \u00a3760,000                     | $975,000             | 175%                          | 40%                           | 250%                         |\n| James Turner       | Group Chief Risk and  Compliance/uni00A0Officer                   | HKD7,330,000                 | $945,000             | 175%                          | 40%                           | 250%                         |\n| Mike Wells         | Group Chief Executive                                             | \u00a31,149,000                   | $1,473,000           | 200%                          | 40%                           | 400%                         |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 The exchange rate used to convert pay to USD is the reporting rate during 2020 of 1.2824:1 for GBP and 1:7.7560 for HKD.

Deloitte was appointed by the Committee in 2011 following a/uni00A0competitive tender process. As part of this process, the Committee considered the services that Deloitte provided to Prudential and its competitors, as well as other potential conflicts of interest. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants' Group and voluntarily operates under their code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK. Deloitte regularly meets with the Chair of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Committee without management present. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Prudential that may impair their independence and objectivity. The total fees paid to Deloitte for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2020 were \u00a375,500 charged on a time and materials basis. During 2020, Deloitte provided Prudential management advice on remuneration, capital optimisation, digital and technology, taxation, internal audit, real estate, global mobility and other financial, ESG, risk and regulatory matters. Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within Deloitte. The Committee reviewed Deloitte's appointment in March 2019 and considered Deloitte to be independent. As disclosed in the 2019 Directors' remuneration report, the Committee agreed to review the appointment of its independent adviser during 2020. In light of/uni00A0the restrictions resulting from Covid-19, the tender process commenced in late 2020 and will be completed during 2021.",

The remuneration above was paid in respect of their service as Executive Directors. While salary and certain monthly paid benefits reflect what was actually delivered during the period, other benefits, bonus, LTIP releases and pension benefits are pro-rata for the period. The 2019 LTIP release for Nic Nicandrou has been pro-rated for 28.5 months of the LTIP's 36-month performance period to reflect his time as an Executive Director during the LTIP's performance period.\n- 3 Michael Falcon, Nic Nicandrou and James Turner are paid in their local currency and exchange rate fluctuations will therefore impact the reported values.\n- 4 John Foley stepped down from the Board on 16 May 2019. He subsequently left the Company on the demerger of M&G plc from Prudential plc on 21 October 2019. As an Executive Director of/uni00A0Prudential plc during 2019 Mr Foley was eligible to receive a 2019 bonus award of up to 180% of salary. Since transferring to M&G plc it was agreed with M&G plc that his 2019 bonus would be/uni00A0assessed and determined by the M&G plc Remuneration Committee and would be paid by M&G plc. No 2019 bonus award was paid to Mr Foley by Prudential plc.\n- Mr Foley's 2017-2019 PLTIP award was exchanged for an equivalent award over M&G plc shares. Under the terms of the Demerger Agreement this replacement award should be of an equivalent value; with the same release schedule; subject to equivalent malus and clawback provisions and subject to performance conditions which are relevant to M&G plc and which are no more or less onerous than those which originally applied.\n- The amount of any bonus payment (including any deferred component) to John Foley in respect of 2019 (including that awarded for performance and service during the pre-demerger period) and the vesting of Mr Foley's replacement 2017-2019 long-term incentive award were disclosed by M&G plc and described in the M&G plc Directors' remuneration report as set out in the/uni00A0M&G plc 2019 Annual Report.\n- 5 To facilitate Nic Nicandrou's relocation to Hong Kong, benefits included \u00a395,000 to cover accommodation.\n- 6 James Turner relocated to Hong Kong on 1 August 2019 and since has been paid in HK dollars; 2019 benefits included \u00a3160,000 to cover accommodation.\n\n## Remuneration in respect of performance in 2020\n\n## Base salary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Directors' salaries were reviewed in 2019 with changes effective from 1 January 2020. When the Committee took these decisions it/uni00A0considered:\n\n- -The salary increase budgets for other employees, which vary across our business units, reflecting local market conditions;\n- -The performance and experience of each Executive Director;\n- -The relative size of each Executive Director's role; and\n- -The performance of the Group.\n\nAfter careful consideration by the Committee, all Executive Directors received a salary increase of 2 per cent. The 2020 salary increase budgets for other employees across our business units were between 2.5 per cent and 5.1 per cent.\n\nTo provide context for the market review, information was also drawn from the following market reference points:\n\n| Executive        | Role                                                      | Benchmarks used to assess remuneration                                                    |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark FitzPatrick | Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer | FTSE 40 International insurance companies                                                 |\n| James Turner     | Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer                   | FTSE 40 International insurance and financial services  companies with operations in Asia |\n| Mike Wells       | Group Chief Executive                                     | FTSE 40 International insurance companies                                                 |\n\nAs announced by the Company in April 2020, after careful consideration by the Committee, salaries for Executive Directors were reduced to/uni00A0December 2019 levels from 1 April 2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the communities Prudential serves globally.\n\nAs a result, Executive Directors received the following salaries in 2020:\n\n| Executive Director                                                          | 2020 salary  (local currency)  from 1 January 2020   | 2020 salary  (USD) 1  from  1 January 2020   | 2020 salary (local currency)  from 1 April 2020   | 2020 salary (USD) 1  from  1 April 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Mark FitzPatrick, Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer | \u00a3776,000                                             | $995,000                                     | \u00a3760,000                                          | $975,000                                  |\n| James Turner 1 , Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer                    | HKD 7,480,000                                        |                                              | $964,000 HKD 7,330,000                            | $945,000                                  |\n| Mike Wells, Group Chief Executive                                           | \u00a31,172,000                                           | $1,503,000                                   | \u00a31,149,000                                        | $1,473,000                                |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 2020 salaries were converted to US dollars using an exchange rate of 1 GBP to 1.2824 US Dollar and the exchange rate of 1 USD to 7.7560 HKD.

The performance ranges are based on the annual business plans approved by the Board and reflect the ambitions of the Group, in the context of anticipated market conditions. The financial element of Executive Directors' 2020 bonuses was determined by the achievement of four Group measures, namely adjusted operating profit, operating free surplus generation, EEV new business profit and cash flow, which are aligned to the Group's growth and cash generation focus.\n\nPersonal objectives comprise 20 per cent of the bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors. These objectives were established at the start of the year and reflect the Company's Strategic Priorities set by the Board. For 2020, Executive Directors had one shared strategic objective linked to developing plans to determine the Group's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nFunctional objectives account for the remaining 40 per cent of the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's bonus opportunity. These are based on the Group Risk Plan and are developed with input from the Chair of the Group Risk Committee.\n\nAIP payments are subject to meeting minimum capital thresholds which are aligned to the Group risk framework and appetites (as adjusted for any Group Risk Committee approved counter-cyclical buffers), as described in the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's report section of/uni00A0this report.\n\nThe Committee seeks advice from the Group Risk Committee on risk management considerations to inform decisions about remuneration architecture and performance measures to ensure that risk management, culture and conduct are appropriately reflected in the design and operation of Executive Directors' remuneration.\n\n## Performance assessment\n\nThe Committee determines the overall value of the bonus, taking account of the inputs described above and any other factors which it considers relevant. The table below illustrates the weighting of performance measures for 2020 and the level of achievement under the AIP. As set out earlier in this report, the Committee exercised discretion to reduce the bonus outcome for Mike Wells by 30 per cent:\n\n|                    | Weighting of measures (% of total bonus opportunity)   | Weighting of measures (% of total bonus opportunity)   | Weighting of measures (% of total bonus opportunity)   | Achievement against performance measures (% of maximum for each component)   | Achievement against performance measures (% of maximum for each component)   | Achievement against performance measures (% of maximum for each component)   |                                                    |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Executive Director | Group  financial  measures                             | Functional  objectives                                 | Personal objectives                                    | Group  financial  measures                                                   | Functional  objectives                                                       | Personal  objectives                                                         | 2020 AIP outcome 1 (% of total bonus  opportunity) |\n| Mark FitzPatrick   | 80%                                                    | -                                                      | 20%                                                    | 63.4%                                                                        | -                                                                            | 94.0%                                                                        | 69.5%                                              |\n| James Turner       | 40%                                                    | 40%                                                    | 20%                                                    | 63.4%                                                                        | 90.0%                                                                        | 92.9%                                                                        | 79.9%                                              |\n| Mike Wells         | 80%                                                    | -                                                      | 20%                                                    | 63.4%                                                                        | -                                                                            |                                                                              | 74.8% 65.7% reduced to 46.0%                       |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 All bonus awards are subject to 40 per cent deferral for three years and the deferred bonus will be paid in Prudential plc shares or ADRs.\n\nw\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nt\n\ns\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

Group adjusted operating profit was approaching the stretch target. Group free surplus generation exceeded the stretching target established by the Board. Below threshold Group cash flow reflects the lower level of remittances received from the business units. Life new business profit achievement was below threshold reflecting the negative impact of Covid-19.\n\nThe Committee considered a report from the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer which had been approved by the Group Risk Committee. This report confirmed that the 2020 results were achieved within the Group's and business units' risk framework and appetite. The Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer also considered the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, and specific actions taken to mitigate risks, particularly where these may be at the expense of profits or sales. The report also confirmed that the Group met minimum capital thresholds which were aligned to the Group risk framework and appetites. The Committee took into account this advice when determining AIP/uni00A0outcomes for Executive Directors.\n\nThe level of performance required for threshold, plan and maximum payment against the Group's 2020 AIP financial measures and the results achieved are set out below:\n\n| 2020 AIP measure                       | Weighting   | Threshold  ($m)   | Target  ($m)   | Stretch target  ($m)   | Achievement  ($m)   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| Group adjusted operating profit        | 35%         | 4,602             | 5,113          | 5,625                  | 5,507               |\n| Group operating free surplus generated | 30%         | 2,955             | 3,284          | 3,612                  | 3,905               |\n| Group cash flow                        | 20%         | 104               | 302            | 434                    | (478)               |\n| Group EEV new business profit          | 15%         | 3,141             | 4,161          | 4,535                  | 2,802               |\n\n## Personal performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs set out in our Directors' remuneration policy, a proportion of the annual bonus for each Executive Director is based on the achievement of/uni00A0personal objectives including:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -The executive meeting their individual conduct and customer measures;\n- -The executive's contribution to Group strategy as a member of the Board; and\n- -Specific goals related to the function for which they are responsible and progress on major projects.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Committee considered the performance of all executives against objectives established at the start of the year. At its meeting in February 2021, it concluded that there had been a high level of performance against these 2020 objectives. All executives met their individual conduct measures and each Executive Director made a significant contribution to the achievement of Group strategy during 2020.\n\nThe below summarises performance against the personal objectives and strategic priorities for the current Executive Directors:\n\n## Shared strategic objective\n\n| 2020 key strategic objective                                  | Achievement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Performance relative to target   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Develop plans to determine the                                | -Identified potential metrics to measure carbon exposures and  investment portfolios within the scope of carbon footprinting and  used scenario modelling to refine the understanding of the nature  of the potential climate risks. -Invested in digital solutions to support our customers and broader | Above the stretch target         |\n| Group's exposure to climate- related risks and opportunities. | society to adapt to climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                  |\n|                                                               | -Developed ESG framework, aligned with Group strategy making  health and financial security accessible, stewarding the human  impacts of climate change and building social capital.                                                                                                                     |                                  |",

In making these decisions, it reflected on factors including:\n\n- -Adherence to the behavioural, conduct and risk management considerations; and\n- -The experience of the Group's stakeholders during 2020. These considerations included the ways in which the Company supported its customers, people, suppliers and communities during the pandemic. Specifically, the Committee noted that no employees were furloughed or made redundant as a result of the pandemic.

In 2018, all/uni00A0Executive Directors were granted awards under the PLTIP. In determining the financial targets the Committee had regard to the stretching nature/uni00A0of the three-year Business Plan for adjusted operating profit and capital positions as set by the Board. Further, in setting the conduct and diversity targets under the sustainability scorecard, the Committee considered input from Group-wide Internal Audit and the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer on conduct risk for the conduct measure and had regard to the Company's commitment under the Women in Finance Charter for the diversity measure.\n\nThe weightings of the measures are detailed in the table below:\n\n|                    | Weighting of measures   | Weighting of measures                | Weighting of measures    | Weighting of measures                  | Weighting of measures    | Weighting of measures   |                        |                        |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                    |                         |                                      | Sustainability Scorecard | Sustainability Scorecard               | Sustainability Scorecard | Vesting (% of maximum)  | Vesting (% of maximum) | Vesting (% of maximum) |\n| Executive Director | Group TSR 1             | Adjusted  operating  Group  profit 2 | Solvency  measure 3      | ECap  operating  capital  generation 4 | Conduct 5                | Diversity 6             | Threshold  performance | Stretch  performance   |\n| Mark FitzPatrick   | 25%                     | 50%                                  | 6.25%                    | 6.25%                                  | 6.25%                    | 6.25%                   | 25%                    | 100%                   |\n| James Turner 7     | 50%                     | 20%                                  | 7.50%                    | 7.50%                                  | 7.50%                    | 7.50%                   | 25%                    | 100%                   |\n| Mike Wells         | 25%                     | 50%                                  | 6.25%                    | 6.25%                                  | 6.25%                    | 6.25%                   | 25%                    | 100%                   |\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Group TSR is measured on a ranked basis over three years relative to peers.\n- 2 Adjusted operating profit is measured on a cumulative basis over three years.\n- 3 At the time of award a Solvency II operating capital generation measure was used in the sustainability scorecard. As set out in the 'Remuneration decisions taken in relation to the demerger' section of the 2019 Directors' remuneration report, Solvency II operating capital generation was replaced with Group free surplus generation from 1 July 2019 since Prudential ceased to be subject to Solvency II capital requirements and no longer calculated or disclosed a Solvency II position following the demerger of the M&G business and the change in the Company's Group-wide supervisor.\n- 4 This is cumulative three-year ECap Group operating capital generation, less cost of capital (based on the capital position at the start of the performance period).\n- 5 Conduct is assessed through appropriate management action, ensuring there are no significant conduct/culture/governance issues that could result in significant capital add-ons or material fines.\n- 6 Diversity is measured as the percentage of the Leadership Team that is female at the end of 2020. The target for this metric has been based on progress towards the goal that the Company set when it signed the Women in Finance Charter, where 30 per cent of our Leadership Team should be female by the end of 2021.\n- 7 James Turner was granted this award as the Group Chief Risk Officer. Therefore, his award is linked to performance measures with different weightings, as set out above, in line with the requirements of Solvency II.\n\nAs discussed in the section on 'Remuneration decisions taken in relation to the demerger' of the 2019 Directors' remuneration report, the/uni00A0Committee adjusted the performance conditions attached to the 2018 PLTIP awards in order to take account of the demerger, ensuring that the revised performance conditions are no more or less stretching than those originally attached to the awards. The performance assessment provided below and overleaf is based on these adjusted targets.\n\n## Performance assessment\n\nIn deciding the proportion of the awards to be released, the Committee considered actual financial results against performance targets. The/uni00A0Committee also reviewed underlying Company performance to ensure vesting levels were appropriate, including an assessment of whether results were achieved within the Group's risk framework and appetite. Finally, overall vesting levels were reviewed to ensure that levels of reward provided remain reflective of the Company's performance in the challenging circumstances. The Directors' remuneration policy summary section contains further details of the design of Prudential's long-term incentive plans.\n\n## Group adjusted operating profit performance\n\nUnder the adjusted operating profit measure, 25 per cent of the 2018 awards vest for meeting the threshold adjusted operating profit target set/uni00A0at the start of the performance period, increasing to full vesting for performance at or above the stretch level. The table below illustrates the/uni00A0cumulative performance achieved over 2018 to 2020 compared to the adjusted Group targets which exclude M&G plc from the point of/uni00A0demerger:\n\n|                           | 2018-20 adjusted cumulative targets   | 2018-20 adjusted cumulative targets   | 2018-20 adjusted cumulative targets   | Vesting under                   | Vesting under                           |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Group                     | Threshold                             | Plan                                  | Maximum                               | 2018-20 cumulative  achievement | the adjusted  operating  profit element |\n| Adjusted operating profit | $14,216m                              | $15,795m                              | $17,375m                              | $18,472m                        | 100%                                    |\n\nThe cumulative adjusted operating profit target established for the PLTIP is expressed using exchange rates consistent with the reported disclosures.\n\nw\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nt\n\ns\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of comparison. No adjustments were made to the peer group used for 2018 awards in respect of the demerger. The peer group for the/uni00A02018 awards is set out below:\n\n| Aegon         | AIA                | AIG                    | Allianz              |\n|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Aviva         | AXA                | Generali               | Legal & General      |\n| Manulife      | MetLife            | Old Mutual             | Prudential Financial |\n| Standard Life | Sun Life Financial | Zurich Insurance Group |                      |\n\nFollowing the demerger of Quilter from Old Mutual and Old Mutual's delisting from the FTSE on 26 June 2018, the Committee determined that/uni00A0Old Mutual be retained as a TSR peer with no adjustment to its performance during the period prior to its demerger and delisting, and that Old Mutual's TSR performance from the date of its demerger and delisting would track an index of the peers (excluding Prudential plc) for all outstanding PLTIP awards.\n\nPrudential's TSR performance during the performance period (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020) was ranked below the median of the peer group. The portion of the awards related to TSR will therefore lapse.\n\n## Sustainability scorecard performance\n\n## Capital measure - Group Solvency II operating capital generation/Group operating free surplus generation\n\nUnder the Group Solvency II operating capital generation and Group operating free surplus generation measure, performance below threshold results in nil vesting, 25 per cent of the award vests for achieving threshold, increasing to full vesting for performance above the stretch level. The/uni00A0weighted average of the adjusted Group Solvency II operating capital generation from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2019 (target $7.0 billion) and the Group operating free surplus generation from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2020 (target $5.6 billion), which excludes M&G plc performance from the point of demerger, met the cumulative stretch target and therefore generated 100 per cent vesting on this element.\n\n## Capital measure - Group ECap operating capital generation\n\nUnder the Group ECap operating capital generation measure, performance below threshold results in nil vesting, 25 per cent of the award vests for achieving threshold, increasing to full vesting for performance above the stretch level. The adjusted cumulative Group ECap operating capital generation was below the target of $6.8 billion (which excludes M&G plc from the point of demerger) and therefore generated a 0 per cent vesting outcome on this element of the PLTIP.\n\nDetails of cumulative achievement under the capital measures have not been disclosed as the Committee considers that these are commercially sensitive and would put the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors. The Committee will keep this disclosure policy under review based on whether, in its view, disclosure would compromise the Company's competitive position.\n\n## Conduct assessment\n\nUnder the conduct measure, performance below threshold results in nil vesting, 25 per cent of the award vests for partial achievement of the Group's expectations, increasing to full vesting for achieving the Group's expectations. During the performance period there were no conduct, culture or/uni00A0governance issues that resulted in significant capital add-ons or material fines so 100 per cent of this element of the PLTIP vested.\n\n## Diversity assessment\n\nUnder the diversity measure, performance below threshold results in nil vesting, 25 per cent of the award vests for achievement of threshold diversity target (27 per cent of Leadership Team being female) increasing to full vesting for achieving the stretch diversity target (29 per cent of/uni00A0Leadership Team being female). On 31 December 2020, 32.5 per cent of our Leadership Team was female. Since this was above the 29 per cent level required for full vesting, the portion of the awards related to diversity that therefore vested was 100 per cent. Please note that/uni00A0in/uni00A02019 the/uni00A0Leadership Team was subdivided into the Leadership Team and the Executive Council. Both of these leadership groups are considered for/uni00A0the purposes of this assessment.",

TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of/uni00A0comparison. A comprehensive review of the TSR peer group which anticipated the Group's post-demerger footprint was undertaken for/uni00A0the/uni00A02019 PLTIP awards. The companies were selected based on organisational size, product mix and geographical footprint. The peer group/uni00A0for 2020 PLTIP awards is the same as that used for 2019 and is set out below:\n\n| Aegon             | AIA                 | Equitable Holdings   | China Taiping Insurance   |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Great Eastern     | Lincoln National    | Manulife             | MetLife                   |\n| Ping An Insurance | Principal Financial | Prudential Financial | Sun Life Financial        |\n\nw\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nt\n\ns\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

Performance will be assessed on a sliding scale. Each of the measures has equal weighting and the 2020 measures are set out below:\n\n| Capital measure:   | Cumulative three-year ECap Group operating capital generation relative to threshold, less cost of capital (based on the  capital position at the start of the performance period).                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Vesting basis:     | Performance below threshold results in nil vesting, 20 per cent vesting for achieving threshold, increasing to full vesting  for performance above stretch level.

The figure for Mr Turner reflects the change in/uni00A0his/uni00A0package when he relocated to Hong Kong in August 2019.\n- 2 Change in fee levels for Kai Nargolwala and Thomas Watjen is due to the additional fees paid to them as Workforce Engagement Directors.\n- 3 Amy Yip joined the Board In September 2019.\n\nThe regulations prescribe that this comparison should include all employees of the parent company. The number of individuals employed by the parent company is insufficient to be the basis of a representative comparison. Therefore the Committee decided to use all UK-based employees as the basis for this calculation. As disclosed in the 2019 Directors' remuneration report, employees in M&G plc have been excluded from the calculation of average pay in 2019 as M&G plc demerged from Prudential plc on 21 October 2019. The average pay for all employees has been calculated on a full-time equivalent basis by reference to the total pay awarded to UK employees in 2020 and 2019. The salary increase includes uplifts made through the annual salary review, as well as any additional changes in the year; for example to reflect promotions or role changes. The decrease in benefits paid to all UK employees is due to the reduction in the cost to the Company of providing certain benefits.\n\n## Group Chief Executive pay compared with employee pay\n\nThe table below compares the Group Chief Executive's 'single figure' of total remuneration to that received by three representative UK/uni00A0employees in 2020.\n\nThe pay ratio decreased in 2020 which chiefly reflects the higher pay outcomes for the identified employees and a lower bonus outcome for/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group Chief Executive.\n\n| Year   | Method   | 25th  percentile  pay ratio   | Median  pay ratio   | 75th  percentile  pay ratio   |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2020   | Option B | 64:1                          | 42:1                | 29:1                          |\n| 2019 1 | Option B | 78:1                          | 60:1                | 39:1                          |\n\n## Note\n\n- 1 2019 CEO pay ratio has been recalculated to account for the restated 2019 CEO single figure which includes the actual value of the 2017 PLTIP award at vesting.",

        "page_content": "Under the regulations there is a choice of three methodologies to determine the 25th, median and 75th full-time equivalent remuneration of our UK employees. The Company has chosen to use the 2020 hourly rate gender pay gap information (collected in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017) as this method uses data that is aligned with other disclosures made under our gender pay gap reporting and includes all UK employees ('Option B' in the table above). The employees used in the calculations were identified using the most recently collected gender pay gap data, on 29 January 2021, following the end of the financial year. Base salary and total remuneration for these identified employees has then been calculated based on their actual remuneration for 2020. The Committee determined that the identified employees are reasonably representative since the structure of their remuneration arrangements is in line with that of the majority of employees within the UK-based Group Head Office workforce. The same methodology used for calculating the 'single figure' of the Group Chief Executive has been used for calculating the pay and benefits of these three UK employees. No elements of remuneration were omitted or adjusted. The/uni00A0identified individuals were employed on a full-time basis so no further adjustment has been made to their remuneration.\n\nThe salary and total remuneration received during 2020 by the indicative employees used in the above analysis are set out below:\n\n|                                | 25th  percentile   | Median   | 75th  percentile   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|----------|--------------------|\n| 2020 salary ($000)             | 58,000             | 85,000   | 116,000            |\n| Total 2020 remuneration ($000) | 84,000             | 126,000  | 186,000            |\n\nThe Committee believes the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for our UK-based Group Head Office employees. The base salary and total remuneration levels for the Group Chief Executive and the median representative employee are competitively positioned within the relevant markets and reflect the operation of our remuneration structures which are effective in appropriately incentivising staff, having regard to our risk framework, risk appetites and to rewarding the 'how' as well as the 'what' of performance.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nOur UK business, Prudential Services Limited, is the employing entity for all of our London Head Office staff including the UK-based Group Chief/uni00A0Executive and his direct reports. Prudential Services Limited has recently reported its 2020 UK gender pay gap data and details can be found on the Group's website (www.prudentialplc.com/about-us/esg/performance/gender-pay-gap-report).\n\nDue to the change in the Group's business focus, senior management roles are now split between locations in the UK and Asia. The 2020 gender pay gap calculations are based on the employees based in the UK only, and therefore exclude data for part of our senior management team, including a number of senior female leaders, who are based in Hong Kong.\n\nWhile women and men continue to be paid equally for performing similar roles, our gender pay gap reflects the fact that men and women have traditionally held different roles, particularly in the financial services sector. It highlights the fact that we have more men than women in leadership and senior operational roles. In addition, a number of senior roles were transferred to M&G as part of the demerger process. Some of these senior roles were held by women, and as M&G is now excluded from our calculations, this has affected Prudential's reported gender pay gap for this year. We continue to focus our efforts on closing the gender pay gap as quickly as possible. Female representation in our leadership roles has increased from 25 per cent in 2017 to 33 per cent in 2020 in our London Head Office.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consideration of workforce pay and approach to engagement\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered workforce remuneration and related policies in the business units across the Group. Information presented to the Committee, by way of a dashboard, included how the Company's incentive arrangements are aligned with the culture and informed the Committee's decision-making on executive pay and policy. By way of example, business unit salary increase budgets are considered as part of the year-end review of Executive Director compensation and salary increases.\n\nAs part of the Board's wider approach to employee engagement, which also included a Group-wide engagement survey, the Committee took additional measures in 2020 to explain how the remuneration of Executive Directors aligns with the wider Company pay policy. The Company operates a microsite on its intranet that outlines executive pay arrangements during the previous financial year and key areas of change for 2020. It explains to employees that total remuneration for Executive Directors is made up of a number of elements and is governed by both the Directors' remuneration policy and the Group's remuneration policy (which is also published on the Company's website) with the relevant links to/uni00A0these documents. Employee engagement is led by two Non-executive Directors and the Governance Report section of this report describes how they discharged this responsibility during 2020.\n\nr\n\nt",

Each of these resolutions received a significant vote in favour by shareholders and the Committee is grateful for this support and endorsement by our shareholders. The votes received were:\n\n| Resolution                                                       | Votes for     |   % of votes cast | Votes  against   |   % of votes cast | Total votes cast   | Votes  withheld   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| To approve the Directors' remuneration policy  (2020/uni00A0AGM) | 1,930,172,979 |             95.84 | 83,796,656       |              4.16 | 2,013,969,635      | 1,043,445         |\n| To approve the Directors' remuneration report  (2020/uni00A0AGM) | 1,930,404,646 |             96.84 | 63,037,343       |              3.16 | 1,993,441,989      | 21,570,822        |\n\n## Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2021\n\n## Base salary\n\nExecutive Directors' remuneration packages were reviewed in 2020 with changes effective from 1 January 2021. When the Committee made these decisions, it considered the salary increases awarded to other employees in 2020 and the expected increases in 2021. The external market reference points used to provide context to the Committee were similar to those used for 2020 salaries.\n\nIn recognition of the continued focus on pay restraint and after due deliberation the Committee considered there should be no salary increases to/uni00A0the Executive Directors for 2021. The 2021 salary increase budgets for other employees across the Group's business units were between 2 per cent and 4.6 per cent. On this basis, 2021 will be the ninth consecutive year in which the increases generally offered to executives have been below or close to the bottom of the range of salary increases budgeted for the broader workforce.\n\nThe salaries effective from 1 January 2021 are set out below:\n\n- -Mark FitzPatrick: \u00a3760,000\n- -James Turner: HKD7,330,000\n- -Mike Wells: \u00a31,149,000\n\n## 2021 pension entitlements\n\nWhile the approved Directors' remuneration policy provides for a phased reduction of Executive Directors' pension benefits to the workforce rate of 13 per cent of salary, the Committee accelerated this change to be effective on 14 May 2020. Pension levels will remain at this reduced rate/uni00A0for 2021. In addition, statutory contributions will continue to be made into mandatory pension arrangements in the country in which the Executive Directors are based, in line with the local requirements.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nNo changes have been made to the bonus opportunities for Executive Directors for 2021.\n\nThe separation and divestment of Jackson will transform Prudential into a Group targeting the structural opportunities of Asia and Africa. The/uni00A0post-separation Group will focus on achieving sustained double-digit growth in embedded value per share. This will be supported by growth rates of new business profit, which are expected to substantially exceed GDP growth in the markets in which the Group operates. It is therefore imperative that the measures attached to the 2021 AIP and PLTIP awards create a clear focus within the executive team and a straightforward connection with the value to be delivered to shareholders.\n\n## 2021 AIP financial measures\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the need for the weightings of the AIP measures to be sufficiently aligned with the post-separation Group's focus on/uni00A0the high-growth Asia and Africa businesses. The proposed revised weightings of the financial performance measures are set out in the table/uni00A0below.\n\n|                                        | Weightings  (% of financial element)   | Weightings  (% of financial element)   |                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial performance measure          | 2020                                   | 2021                                   | Change and rationale                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Group EEV new business profit          | 15%                                    | 35%                                    | Increase  - to focus the executive team on driving growth in  profitable new business which is critical to the growth in embedded  value of the post-separation Prudential Group |\n| Group adjusted operating profit        | 35%                                    | 25%                                    | Reduction  - to reflect the increased emphasis on growth of new  business.

From the date on which the Group owns less than 50% of Jackson, Jackson will be removed from Group AIP targets and outcomes for the remainder of the relevant year. From this date, Group AIP weightings will be consistent with those adopted for the Asia business. The date from which Jackson is removed from the AIP targets and the resulting changes to the weighting of the bonus metrics will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which this takes place. Principles which will underpin the approach to the separation of Jackson are described in the Annual statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## 2021 share-based long-term incentive awards Award levels\n\nNo changes have been made to the PLTIP award levels for Executive Directors for 2021.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nPerformance conditions for 2021 PLTIP awards have been revised to ensure that reward remains aligned with the strategic priorities and capital allocation framework of the post-separation Group. In particular, RoE replaced with RoEV to reflect the focus on achieving sustained double-digit growth in Embedded Value per share. In addition, the TSR peer group was revised to reflect the footprint of the post-separation Prudential Group.\n\nThe weighting of measures for the 2021 PLTIP awards for all Executive Directors will be as follows:\n\n- -Relative TSR (50 per cent of award);\n- -A return on embedded value measure (30 per cent of award); and\n- -Sustainability scorecard of strategic measures (20 per cent of award).\n\nThe proportion of 2021 long-term incentive awards which will vest for threshold performance will remain at 20 per cent.\n\nThe conduct measure in the sustainability scorecard will include Jackson for 2021 awards for the period in which the Group owns at least 50% of/uni00A0Jackson, whilst the other scorecard metrics and RoEV will be calculated based on the Group excluding the US business. Principles which will underpin the approach to the separation of Jackson are described in the Annual statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Relative TSR\n\nUnder the Group TSR measure, 20 per cent of the award will vest for TSR at the median of the peer group, increasing to full vesting for performance within the upper quartile. TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of/uni00A0comparison.\n\nIn 2020 the Committee reviewed the TSR peer group to reflect the footprint post separation of Jackson. The resulting peer group for 2021 PLTIP/uni00A0awards is set out below:\n\n| AIA Group                      | Allianz                 | AXA                | China Life             |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| China Pacific Insurance (CPIC) | China Taiping Insurance | Great Eastern      | Manulife Financial     |\n| New China Life (NCl)           | Ping An Insurance       | Sun Life Financial | Zurich Insurance Group |\n\n## Return on embedded value\n\nRoEV will replace RoE as the PLTIP measure for 2021 awards. The Company believes that this measure is more relevant, considering the Asia focus of the Group, aligned to the ambition to grow EV and pivot towards EV based valuations.\n\nRoEV will be calculated as the total post-tax EEV operating profit as a percentage of the average EEV basis shareholders' equity. RoEV will be assessed at the Group level.\n\n20 per cent of the award will vest for achieving the threshold level of performance of 9 per cent, increasing to full vesting for reaching the stretch level of at least 11 per cent.",

Executive Directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their/uni00A0location.\n\n## Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes\n\nUK-based Executive Directors are normally eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) approved Prudential SavingsRelated Share Option Scheme. This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with/uni00A0the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.\n\nSince 2014 participants have been able to elect to enter into savings contracts of up to \u00a3500 per month for a period of three or five years. At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares. If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules. Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised. No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or/uni00A0which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the/uni00A0Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Company's ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.\n\nDetails of Executive Directors' rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the 'Outstanding share options' table.\n\n## Share Incentive Plan (SIP)\n\nUK-based Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company's Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Since April 2014, all UK-based employees have been able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of \u00a3150 per month from their gross salary (partnership shares) through the SIP. For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential plc on the open market. Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan. If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.\n\nThe table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with matching shares (awarded on a 1:4 basis) and/uni00A0dividend/uni00A0shares.\n\n|                  |   Year of  initial grant |   Share Incentive  Plan awards  held in Trust  at 1 Jan 2020   (number of  shares) | Partnership  shares  accumulated  in 2020   (number of  shares)   | Matching  shares  accumulated  in 2020   (number of  shares)   |   Dividend  shares  accumulated  in 2020   (number of  shares) |   Share Incentive  Plan awards  held in Trust at  31 Dec 2020   (number of  shares) |\n|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark FitzPatrick |                     2017 |                                                                                372 | 150                                                               | 37                                                             |                                                             11 |                                                                                 570 |\n| James Turner     |                     2011 |                                                                                829 | -                                                                 | -                                                              |                                                             20 |                                                                                 849 |\n| Mike Wells       |                     2015 |                                                                                719 | 150                                                               | 38                                                             |                                                             18 |                                                                                 925 |\n\n## Cash-settled long-term incentive awards\n\nThis information has been prepared in line with the reporting requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and sets out Executive Directors' outstanding share awards and share options. For details of the cash-settled long-term incentive awards held by one Executive Director, please/uni00A0see our 2019 Annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Dilution\n\nDilution Releases from the Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan and the Prudential Agency Long Term Incentive Plan are satisfied using new issue shares rather than by purchasing shares in the open market. Shares relating to options granted under all-employee share plans are also satisfied by new issue shares. The combined dilution from all outstanding shares and options at 31 December 2020 was 1 per cent of the total share capital at the time. Deferred bonus awards will continue to be satisfied by the purchase of shares in the open market.",

It is not the result attributable to shareholders principally because total corporate tax of the Group includes those on/uni00A0the/uni00A0income of consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders. These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of/uni00A0the Company under IAS 12. Consequently, the IFRS profit before tax measure is not representative of pre-tax profit attributable to shareholders as it is determined after deducting the cost of/uni00A0policyholder benefits and movements in the liability for unallocated surplus of with-profits funds after adjusting for tax borne by policyholders.\n\ns",

The Group currently has businesses in Asia, Africa and the US and head office functions in London and Hong Kong. The Group helps individuals get the most out of life through life and health insurance, and retirement and asset management solutions.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Standards as issued by the IASB, the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. At 31 December 2020, there were no differences between IFRS Standards as issued by the IASB, the international accounting standards as required by the Companies Act 2006 and/uni00A0international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.\n\nThe Group accounting policies are the same as those applied for the year ended 31 December 2019 with the exception of the adoption of/uni00A0the/uni00A0new and amended IFRS Standards as described in note A2.\n\n## Going concern basis of accounting\n\nThe Directors have made an assessment of going concern covering a period of at least 12 months from the date that these financial statements are/uni00A0approved. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered both the Group's current performance, solvency and liquidity and the Group's business plan taking into account the Group's principal risks and the mitigations available to it which are described in the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's report. The assessment also includes the consideration of the results of a number of stress and scenario testing over the business plan covering scenarios that reflect the possible impacts of Covid-19. The stress tests included the assessment of the potential impact of up/uni00A0or down interest rate movements combined with corporate credit spread widening, a rating level downgrade on part of the credit asset portfolio, falling equity values and insurance stresses (such as changes in policyholder behaviour, including lapses, and increased morbidity in Asia).\n\nBased on the above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue their operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date that these financial statements are approved. No material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern have been identified. The Directors therefore consider it/uni00A0appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements for the year ended 31 December/uni00A02020.\n\nThe parent company statement of financial position prepared in accordance with the UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (including Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework') is presented on page 302.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nThe exchange rates applied for balances and transactions in currencies other than the presentation currency of the Group, US dollars (USD) were:\n\n|                         | Closing rate at year end   | Closing rate at year end   | Average rate for the year to date   | Average rate for the year to date   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| USD : local currency    | 31 Dec 2020                | 31 Dec 2019                | 31 Dec 2020                         | 31 Dec 2019                         |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)      | 6.54                       | 6.97                       | 6.90                                | 6.91                                |\n| Hong Kong dollar (HKD)  | 7.75                       | 7.79                       | 7.76                                | 7.84                                |\n| Indian rupee (INR)      | 73.07                      | 71.38                      | 74.12                               | 70.43                               |\n| Indonesian rupiah (IDR) | 14,050.00                  | 13,882.50                  | 14,541.70                           | 14,140.84                           |\n| Malaysian ringgit (MYR) | 4.02                       | 4.09                       | 4.20                                | 4.14                                |\n| Singapore dollar (SGD)  | 1.32                       | 1.34                       | 1.38                                | 1.36                                |\n| Taiwan dollar (TWD)     | 28.10                      | 29.98                      | 29.44                               | 30.91                               |\n| Thai baht (THB)         | 30.02                      | 29.75                      | 31.29                               | 31.05                               |\n| UK pound sterling (GBP) | 0.73                       | 0.75                       | 0.78                                | 0.78                                |\n| Vietnamese dong (VND)   | 23,082.50                  | 23,172.50                  | 23,235.84                           | 23,227.64                           |\n\n## Foreign exchange translation\n\nIn order to present the consolidated financial statements in USD, the results and financial position of entities not using USD as functional currency (ie the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) must be translated into USD. The general principle for converting foreign currency transactions is to translate at the functional currency spot rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. From 2020, Prudential determines and declares its dividend in USD. All assets and liabilities of entities not operating in USD are converted at closing exchange rates while all income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on/uni00A0transaction dates. The impact of these currency translations is recorded as a separate component in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nCertain notes to the financial statements present comparative information at constant exchange rates (CER), in addition to the reporting at/uni00A0actual exchange rates (AER) used throughout the consolidated financial statements. AER are actual historical exchange rates for the specific accounting year, being the average rates over the year for the income statement and the closing rates at the balance sheet date for the statement of financial position. CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rate, ie current year average rates for the income statement and current year closing rates for the statement of financial position.\n\nThe effect of foreign exchange movements from continuing operations arising during the years shown recognised in other comprehensive income is:\n\n|                          | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|--------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Asia operations          | 235        | 194        |\n| Unallocated to a segment | (2)        | (42)       |\n|                          | 233        | 152        |\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Other accounting policies, where significant, are presented in the relevant individual notes. All accounting policies are applied consistently for both years presented and normally are not subject to changes unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.\n\n## A3.1 Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires Prudential to make accounting estimates and judgements about the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, which are both recognised and unrecognised (eg contingent liabilities) in the financial statements. Prudential evaluates its critical accounting estimates, including those related to long-term business provisioning and the fair value of assets as required. The/uni00A0notes below set out those critical accounting policies, the application of which requires the Group to make critical estimates and judgements. Also set out are further critical accounting policies affecting the presentation of the Group's results and other items that require the application of/uni00A0critical estimates and judgements.\n\n## (a) Critical accounting policies with associated critical estimates and judgements\n\n## Measurement of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of with-profits\n\nThe measurement basis of policyholder liabilities is dependent upon the classification of the contracts under IFRS 4.\n\nImpacts $462.1 billion of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of withprofits funds including those held by joint venture and associates.\n\nPolicyholder liabilities are estimated based on/uni00A0a number of actuarial assumptions (eg/uni00A0mortality, morbidity, policyholder behaviour and expenses).\n\nThe Group applies judgement in determining the actuarial assumptions to be applied to estimate the future amounts due to or from the policyholder in the measurement of the policyholder liabilities.\n\nMeasurement of insurance contract liabilities and investment contract liabilities with discretionary participation features\n\nIFRS 4 permits the continued usage of previously applied Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP) for insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features.\n\nA modified statutory basis of reporting was adopted by the Group on first time adoption of IFRS/uni00A0Standards in 2005. This was set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by/uni00A0the Association of British Insurers (ABI SORP). The ABI SORP was withdrawn for the accounting periods beginning in or after 2015. As used in these consolidated financial statements, the term 'grandfathered' ABI SORP refers to the requirements of the pronouncements prior to its withdrawal.\n\nFor investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features, IAS 39 is/uni00A0applied and, where the contract includes an investment management element, IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' applies.\n\nThe policies applied in each business unit are noted below. When measuring policyholder liabilities, a number of assumptions are applied to estimate future amounts due to or from the policyholder. The nature of assumptions varies by product and among the most significant is policyholder behaviour, particularly in the US. Additional details of valuation methodologies and assumptions applied for material product types are discussed in note C3.4.\n\n## Asia insurance operations\n\nThe policyholder liabilities for businesses in Asia are generally determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP, adjusted to comply with the modified statutory basis where necessary. Refinements to the local reserving methodology are generally treated as changes in estimates, dependent on their nature. The UK-style with-profits funds' liabilities in Hong Kong are valued under the realistic basis in accordance with the requirements of 'grandfathered' FRS/uni00A027 'Life Assurance' (issued by the Accounting Standards Board in 2004 and withdrawn in/uni00A02015). The realistic basis requires the value of liabilities to be calculated as the sum of a with-profits benefits reserve, future policy-related liabilities and the realistic current liabilities of/uni00A0the fund. In/uni00A0Taiwan and India, US GAAP principles are applied.\n\nThe sensitivity of Asia insurance operations to variations in key estimates and assumptions, including mortality and morbidity, is discussed in note C6.4.",

The Group determines qualifying costs that should be capitalised (ie those costs of acquiring new insurance contracts that meet the criteria under the Group's accounting policy for DAC). The recoverability of the DAC is measured and/uni00A0the DAC asset is deemed impaired if the projected margins (which are estimated based on/uni00A0a/uni00A0number of assumptions similar to those underlying policyholder liabilities) are less than the/uni00A0carrying value. To the extent that the future margins differ from those anticipated, an/uni00A0adjustment to the carrying value will be necessary either through a charge to the income statement (if the projected margins are lower than carrying value) or through a change in the amortisation profile.\n\n## Asia insurance operations\n\nFor those business units applying US GAAP to insurance assets and liabilities, as permitted by the 'grandfathered' ABI SORP, principles similar to those set out in the US insurance operations paragraph below are applied to the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs. For other business units in Asia, the general principles of the 'grandfathered' ABI SORP are applied. In/uni00A0general, deferral of acquisition costs is shown by an explicit carrying value in the balance sheet. However, in some Asia operations the deferral is implicit through the reserving basis.\n\n## US insurance operations\n\nThe most material estimates and assumptions applied in the measurement and amortisation of/uni00A0DAC balances relate to the US insurance operations.\n\nThe Group's US insurance operations apply FASB ASU 2010-26 on 'Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts' and capitalise only those incremental costs directly relating to successfully acquiring a contract.\n\nFor term life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums. For annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts. For fixed and fixed index/uni00A0annuity and interest-sensitive life business, the key assumption is the long-term spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders.\n\nThe majority of Jackson's DAC relates to its variable annuities business. For variable annuity business, a key assumption is the long-term investment return from the separate accounts, which for 2020 is 7.15 per cent (2019: 7.4 per cent). The impact of using this return is reflected in/uni00A0t wo principal ways, namely:\n\n- -Through the projected expected gross profits that are used to determine the amortisation of/uni00A0DAC. This is applied through the use of a mean reversion technique which is described in/uni00A0more detail below; and\n- -The required level of provision for claims for guaranteed minimum death, 'for life' withdrawal, and income benefits.\n\nThe present value of the estimated gross profit is computed using the rate of interest that accrues to policyholder balances (sometimes referred to as the contract rate).\n\nEstimated gross profits for the fixed interest rate annuities, fixed index annuities and variable annuities include estimates of the following, each of which will be determined based on the best estimate of amounts over the life of the book of contracts without provision for adverse deviation:\n\n- -Amounts expected to be assessed against policyholder balances for mortality less benefit claims in excess of related policyholder balances;\n- -Amounts expected to be assessed for contract administration less costs incurred for contract administration;\n- -Amounts expected to be earned from the investment of policyholder balances less interest credited to policyholder balances;\n- -Amounts expected to be assessed against policyholder balances upon termination of/uni00A0contracts (sometimes referred to as surrender charges);\n- -Assumptions for the long-term investment return for the separate accounts;\n- -Assumptions for future hedge costs; and\n- -Other expected assessments and credits.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Projected returns after the mean reversion period revert back to the long-term investment return. For further details on current balances, assumptions and sensitivity, refer to note C4.2.\n\nTo ensure that the methodology in extreme market movements produces future expected returns that are realistic, the mean reversion technique has a cap and floor feature whereby the/uni00A0projected returns in each of the next five years can be no more than 15 per cent per annum and no less than zero per cent per annum (both gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees) in each year.\n\nJackson makes certain adjustments to the DAC assets which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income ('shadow accounting') to match the recognition of unrealised gains or losses on available-for-sale securities causing the adjustments. More precisely, shadow DAC adjustments reflect the change in DAC that would have arisen if the assets held in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising unrealised gains or losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.\n\n## Carrying value of distribution rights intangible assets\n\nThe Group applies judgement to assess whether factors such as the financial performance of the distribution arrangement, changes in relevant legislation and regulatory requirements indicate an impairment of/uni00A0intangible assets representing distribution/uni00A0rights.\n\nTo determine the impaired value, the Group estimates the discounted future expected cash flows arising from distribution rights.\n\nAffects $4.0 billion of assets as shown in/uni00A0note/uni00A0C4.2.\n\n## Financial investments - Valuation\n\nFinancial investments held at fair value represent $412.8 billion of the Group's total/uni00A0assets.\n\nFinancial investments held at amortised cost/uni00A0represent $14.6 billion of the Group's total assets.\n\nThe Group estimates the fair value of financial investments that are not actively traded using quotations from independent third parties or/uni00A0internally developed pricing models.\n\nDistribution rights relate to bancassurance partnership arrangements for the distribution of products for the term of the contractual agreement with the bank partner, for which an asset is/uni00A0recognised based on fees paid (including fees payable in future years). Distribution rights impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nTo assess indicators of an impairment, the Group monitors a number of internal and external factors, including indications that the financial performance of the arrangement is likely to be worse than expected and changes in relevant legislation and regulatory requirements that could impact the Group's ability to continue to sell new business through the bancassurance channel, and then applies judgement to assess whether these factors indicate that an impairment has occurred.\n\nIf an impairment has occurred, a charge is recognised in the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is/uni00A0the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is calculated as the present value of future expected cash flows from the asset or the cash generating unit to which it is allocated.\n\nThe Group holds the majority of its financial investments at fair value (either through profit or/uni00A0loss or available-for-sale). Financial investments held at amortised cost primarily comprise loans and deposits.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS Standards are determined by the use of current market bid prices for exchange-quoted investments or by using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques.\n\nThe estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arm's-length transaction. This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.\n\nCurrent market bid prices are used to value investments having quoted prices. Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued using prices provided by third parties such as/uni00A0brokers or pricing services. Financial investments measured at fair value are classified into a/uni00A0three-level hierarchy as described in note C2.1.",

Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and/or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the/uni00A0price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the/uni00A0measurement date. The valuation techniques include the use of recent arm's-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option-adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation and may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates. Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments. Details of the financial investments classified as 'level 3' to which valuation techniques are applied and the sensitivity of profit before tax to a/uni00A0change in the valuation of these items, are presented in note C2.2(ii).\n\n## Financial investments - Determining impairment of 'available-for-sale' and 'amortised cost' assets\n\nThe Group applies judgement to assess whether factors such as the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, the financial condition and the prospects of the issuer indicate an impairment in value of financial investments classified as 'availablefor-sale' or 'held at amortised cost'.\n\nIf evidence for impairment exists, valuation techniques, including estimates, are then applied in determining the impaired value, which is based on its expectation of discounted future cash flows. If the impaired value is less than book cost, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nAffects $49.3 billion of assets.\n\nFor financial investments classified as 'available for sale' or 'at amortised cost', if a loss event that/uni00A0will have a detrimental effect on cash flows is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in/uni00A0the income statement. The loss recognised is determined as the difference between the book/uni00A0cost and the fair value or estimated future cash flows of the relevant impaired assets. The/uni00A0loss comprises the effect of the expected loss of contractual cash flows and any additional market-price driven temporary reductions in values.\n\n## Available-for-sale securities\n\nThe Group's available-for-sale securities are principally held by the US insurance operations. For these securities, the consideration of evidence of impairment requires management's judgement. In making this determination, a range of market and industry indicators are considered including the severity and duration of the decline in fair value and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer. The factors reviewed include economic conditions, credit loss experience, other issuer-specific developments and future cash flows. These assessments are based on the best available information at the time. Factors such as market liquidity, the/uni00A0widening of bid/ask spreads and a change in cash flow assumptions can contribute to future/uni00A0price volatility. If actual experience differs negatively from the assumptions and other considerations used in the consolidated financial statements, unrealised losses currently in/uni00A0equity may be recognised in the income statement in future periods.\n\nFor US residential mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale, impairment is estimated using a model of expected future cash/uni00A0flows. Key assumptions used in the model include assumptions about how much of/uni00A0the/uni00A0currently delinquent loans will eventually default and assumed loss severity.\n\nAdditional details on the methodology and estimates used to determine impairments of/uni00A0the/uni00A0available-for-sale securities of Jackson are described in note C1.1.\n\n## Assets held at amortised cost\n\nWhen assets held at amortised cost are subject to impairment testing, estimated future cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the asset. In estimating future cash flows, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist, or for conditions that are expected to arise. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using the financial asset's original or variable effective interest rate and exclude credit losses that have not yet been incurred.\n\n## Reversal of impairment losses\n\nIf, in subsequent periods, an impaired debt security held on an available-for-sale basis or an/uni00A0impaired loan or receivable recovers in value (in part or in full) and this recovery can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment, then any amount determined to/uni00A0have been recovered is reversed through the income statement.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## A3 Accounting policies continued\n\n## A3.2  New accounting pronouncements not yet effective\n\nThe following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued by the IASB but are not yet effective in 2020. For 2021 and beyond, the Group will prepare financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and will be reliant on the UK adoption for the new accounting pronouncements that have not been endorsed by the EU by 31 December 2020.\n\nThis is not intended to be a complete list as only those standards, interpretations and amendments that could have a material impact on the Group's financial statements are discussed.\n\n## IFRS 9 'Financial instruments: Classification and measurement'\n\nIFRS 9 became mandatorily effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted and transitional rules apply.\n\nThe Group met the eligibility criteria for temporary exemption under the Amendments to IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 and has accordingly deferred the adoption of IFRS 9 until the date when IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' is expected to be adopted upon its current mandatory effective date. The Group is eligible as its activities are predominantly to issue insurance contracts based on the criteria as set out in the amendments to IFRS 4. The required disclosure of the fair value of the Group's financial assets, showing the amounts for instruments that meet the 'Solely for Payment of Principal and Interest' (SPPI) criteria but do not meet the definition of held for trading and are not managed and evaluated on a fair value basis separately from all other financial assets, is provided below.\n\nWhen adopted IFRS 9 replaces the existing IAS 39 'Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement' and will affect the following three/uni00A0areas:\n\n## The classification and the measurement of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 redefines the classification of financial assets. Based on the way in which the assets are managed in order to generate cash flows and their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest'), financial assets are classified into one of the following categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). An option is also available at initial recognition to irrevocably designate a financial asset as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces accounting mismatches.\n\nUnder IAS 39, 88 per cent of the Group's investments are valued at FVTPL and the Group's current expectation is that a significant proportion of its investments will continue to be designated as such under IFRS 9. The Group is currently evaluating whether some of the assets held at amortised cost today should be designated at FVTPL in conjunction with the required changes in classification to the relevant underlying liabilities upon adoption of IFRS 17.\n\nThe existing IAS 39 amortised cost measurement for financial liabilities is largely maintained under IFRS 9. For financial liabilities designated at/uni00A0F V TPL IFRS 9 requires changes in fair value due to changes in entity's own credit risk to be recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## The calculation of the impairment charge relevant for financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI\n\nA new impairment model based on an expected credit loss approach replaces the existing IAS 39 incurred loss impairment model, resulting in earlier recognition of credit losses compared to IAS 39. This aspect is the most complex area of IFRS 9 to implement and will involve significant judgements and estimation processes. The Group is currently assessing the scope of assets to which these requirements will apply but as noted above it is currently expected that the majority of assets will be held at FVTPL to which these requirements will not apply.\n\n## The hedge accounting requirements which are more closely aligned with the risk management activities of the Company\n\nNo significant change to the Group's hedge accounting is currently anticipated, but this remains under review.\n\nThe Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and implementing this standard in conjunction with IFRS 17 as permitted. Further details on/uni00A0IFRS/uni00A017 are provided below.\n\nThe parent company and a number of intermediate holding companies in the UK and non-insurance subsidiaries in Asia adopted IFRS 9 in/uni00A02018 in their individual or separate financial statements where these statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, including the UK Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. The public availability of the financial statements for these entities varies according to/uni00A0the local laws and regulations of each jurisdiction. The results for these entities continue to be accounted for on an IAS 39 basis in/uni00A0these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's directly held financial assets at 31 December 2020 and 2019 are shown below. Financial assets with contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) as defined by IFRS 9 are shown separately. This excludes financial assets that meet the definition of held for trading or are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.",

In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17, including delaying the effective date to reporting periods on or after 1 January 2023. The/uni00A0standard is subject to endorsement in the UK via the UK Endorsement Board which is currently being established. The Group intends to adopt the new standard on/uni00A0its/uni00A0mandatory effective date, alongside the adoption of IFRS 9.\n\nIFRS 4 permitted insurers to continue to use the statutory basis of accounting for insurance assets and liabilities that existed in their jurisdictions prior to January 2005. IFRS 17 replaces this with a new measurement model for all insurance contracts.\n\nIFRS 17 requires liabilities for insurance contracts to be recognised as the present value of future cash flows, incorporating an explicit risk adjustment, which is updated at each reporting date to reflect current conditions, and a contractual service margin (CSM) that is initially set equal/uni00A0and opposite to any day-one gain arising on initial recognition. Losses are recognised directly into the income statement. For measurement purposes, contracts are grouped together into contracts of similar risk, profitability profile and issue year, with further divisions for contracts that/uni00A0are managed separately.\n\nProfit for insurance contracts under IFRS 17 is represented by the recognition of the services provided to policyholders in the period (release/uni00A0of the CSM), release from non-economic risk (release of risk adjustment) and investment profit.\n\nThe CSM is released as profit over the coverage period of the insurance contract, reflecting the delivery of services to the policyholder. For/uni00A0certain contracts with participating features (where a substantial share of the fair value of the related investments and other underlying items/uni00A0is paid to policyholders), the CSM reflects the variable fee to shareholders. For these contracts, the CSM is adjusted to reflect the changes in economic experience and assumptions. For all other contracts the CSM is only adjusted for non-economic assumptions.\n\nIFRS 17 introduces a new measure of insurance revenue, based on the delivery of services to policyholders and excluding any premiums related to the investment elements of policies, which will be significantly different from existing premium revenue measures, currently reported in the income statement.\n\nIn order to transition to IFRS 17, the amount of deferred profit, being the CSM at transition date, needs to be determined. IFRS 17 requires this/uni00A0CSM to be calculated as if the standard had applied retrospectively. However, if this is not practical an entity is required to choose either a/uni00A0modified retrospective approach or to determine the CSM by reference to the fair value of the liabilities at the transition date. The approach for/uni00A0determining the CSM will have a significant impact on both shareholders' equity and on the amount of profits on in-force business in future reporting periods.",

        "page_content": "## IFRS 17 implementation programme\n\nIFRS 17 is expected to have a significant impact as the requirements of the new standard are complex and requires a fundamental change to accounting for insurance contracts as well as the application of significant judgement and new estimation techniques. The effect of changes required to the Group's accounting policies as a result of implementing these standards, that are expected to alter the timing of IFRS profit recognition, are currently uncertain, particularly as amendments were issued by the IASB in June 2020 to IFRS 17. The implementation of this/uni00A0standard will involve significant enhancements to IT, actuarial and finance systems of the Group.\n\nThe Group has a Group-wide implementation programme to implement IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. The programme is responsible for setting Group-wide accounting policies and developing application methodologies, establishing appropriate processes and controls, sourcing appropriate data and implementing actuarial and finance system changes.\n\nA Group-wide Steering Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer with participation from the/uni00A0Group Risk function and the Group's and business units' senior finance managers, provides oversight and strategic direction to the implementation programme. A number of sub-committees are also in place to provide governance over the technical interpretation and accounting policies selected, design and delivery of the programme. During 2020, the Group has made significant progress with the development of the accounting policies and application methodologies and the build of the actuarial and finance systems. The Group is/uni00A0also/uni00A0assessing the IASB amendments issued in June 2020 and incorporating the changes into the delivery of the programme.\n\n## Other new accounting pronouncements\n\nIn addition to the above, the following new accounting pronouncements have also been issued and are not yet effective but the Group is/uni00A0not/uni00A0expecting them to have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements:\n\n- -Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 and IFRS 16 'Interest rate benchmark reform - phase 2' issued in August 2020 and effective from 1 January 2021;\n- -Amendments to IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use' issued in May 2020 and effective from 1 January 2022;\n- -Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IFRS 3, 'Business combination' issued in May 2020 and effective from 1 January 2022;\n- -Amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous contracts - Cost of fulfilling a contract' issued in May 2020 and effective from 1 January 2022;\n- -Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 issued in May 2020 and effective from 1 January 2022;\n- -Amendments to IAS 1 'Classification of liabilities as current or non-current' issued in January 2020 and effective from 1 January 2023;\n- -Amendments to IAS 1 'Disclosure of accounting policies' issued in February 2021 and effective from 1 January 2023; and\n- -Amendments to IFRS 8 'Definition of Accounting Estimates' issued in February 2021 and effective from 1 January 2023.\n\nt\n\nE",

In 2020, falling interest rates in certain parts of Asia led to lower discount rates on policyholder liabilities under the local reserving basis applied, which were not fully offset by unrealised bond and equity gains in the year and this led to the overall negative short-term investment fluctuations in Asia.\n\n## (ii) US operations\n\nThe short-term fluctuations in investment returns in the US are reported net of the related charge for amortisation of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) credit of $812 million as shown in note C4.2 (2019: credit of $1,248 million) and comprise amounts in respect of the following items: 2020 $m 2019 $m\n\n| Net equity hedge result  note (a)                       | (6,334)   | (4,582)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other than equity-related derivatives  note (b)         | 1,682     | 678       |\n| Debt securities  note (c)                               | 474       | 156       |\n| Equity-type investments: actual less longer-term return | (40)      | 18        |\n| Other items                                             | (44)      | (27)      |\n| Total net of related DAC amortisation                   | (4,262)   | (3,757)   |\n\n## Notes\n\n(a)\n\nThe purpose of the inclusion of the net equity hedge result in short-term fluctuations in investment returns is to segregate the amount included within pre-tax profit that relates to the accounting effect of market movements on both the value of guarantees in Jackson's products including variable annuities and on the related derivatives used to manage the exposures inherent in these guarantees. The level of fees recognised in short-term fluctuations in investment returns is determined by reference to that allowed for within the reserving basis. The/uni00A0variable annuity guarantees are valued in accordance with either Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures or ASC Topic 944, Financial Services - Insurance depending on the type of guarantee. Both approaches require an entity to determine the total fee ('the fee assessment') that is expected to fund future projected benefit payments arising using the assumptions applicable for that method. The method under ASC Topic 820 requires this fee assessment to be fixed at the time of issue. As/uni00A0the/uni00A0fees included within the initial fee assessment are earned, they are included in short-term fluctuations in investment returns to match the corresponding movement in the guarantee liability. Other guarantee fees are included in adjusted operating profit, which in 2020 were $704 million (2019: $699 million), pre-tax and net of related DAC amortisation. As the Group applies US GAAP for the measured value of/uni00A0the product guarantees, the net equity hedge result also includes asymmetric impacts where the measurement bases of the liabilities and associated derivatives used to manage the Jackson annuity business differ.\n\nThe net equity hedge result therefore includes significant accounting mismatches and other factors that do not represent the economic result. These other factors include:\n\n- - The variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity embedded options being only partially fair valued under 'grandfathered' US GAAP;\n- - The interest rate exposure being managed through the other than equity-related derivative programme explained in note (b) below; and\n- - Jackson's management of its economic exposures for a number of other factors that are treated differently in the accounting frameworks such as future fees and assumed volatility levels. The net equity hedge result can be summarised as follows: 2020 $m 2019 $m\n\n| Fair value movements on equity hedge instruments *                                         | (5,219)   | (5,314)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accounting value movements on the variable and fixed index annuity guarantee liabilities * | (2,030)   | (22)      |\n| Fee assessments net of claim payments                                                      | 915       | 754       |\n| Total net of related DAC amortisation                                                      | (6,334)   | (4,582)   |\n\n- * The value movements on the variable annuity guarantees and fixed indexed annuity options and the derivative instruments held to manage their equity exposures are discussed in the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report.\n- (b)  The fluctuations for other than equity-related derivatives comprise the net effect of:\n- - Fair value movements on free-standing, other than equity-related derivatives;\n- -  Fair value movements on the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB) reinsurance asset that are not matched by movements in the underlying GMIB liability, which is not fair valued; and\n- - Related amortisation of DAC.\n\nThe free-standing, other than equity-related derivatives, are held to manage interest rate exposures and durations within the general account and the variable annuity guarantees and fixed index annuity embedded options described in note (a) above. Accounting mismatches arise because of differences between the measurement basis and presentation of the derivatives, which are fair valued with movements recorded in the income statement, and the exposures they are intended to manage.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

addition to the accounting for realised gains and losses described above for Jackson general account debt securities, included within the statement of other comprehensive income is a pre-tax net unrealised gain of $2,676 million, net of related amortisation of DAC, arising in the year/uni00A0(2019: $3,392 million) on debt securities classified as available-for-sale, partially offset by the recycling of $2,282 million gains, net of related amortisation of DAC, to the income statement on transfer of debt securities to Athene (see note D1.1). Temporary market value movements do/uni00A0not reflect defaults or impairments. Additional details of the movement in the value of the Jackson portfolio are included in note C1.1.\n\n## B1.3 Determining operating segments and performance measure of operating segments\n\n## Operating segments\n\nThe Group's operating segments for financial reporting purposes are defined and presented in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' on/uni00A0the basis of the management reporting structure and its financial management information.\n\nUnder the Group's management and reporting structure, its chief operating decision maker is the Group Executive Committee (GEC). In the management structure, responsibility is delegated to the Chief Executive Officers of the Group's Asia and US business units for the day-to-day management of their business units (within the framework set out in the Group Governance Manual). Financial management information used by/uni00A0the GEC aligns with these business segments. These operating segments, Asia operations and US operations, derive revenue from both insurance and asset management activities.\n\nOperations which do not form part of any business unit are reported as 'Unallocated to a segment'. These include head office costs in London and Hong Kong. The Group's Africa operations do not form part of any operating segment under the structure, and their assets and liabilities and profit or loss before tax are not material to the overall financial position of the Group. The Group's Africa operations are therefore also reported as/uni00A0'Unallocated to a segment'.\n\nIn preparation for the planned separation of Jackson, the management information received by the GEC has been revised in 2021, leading to a/uni00A0change in the Group's operating segments which will be presented in the 2021 half year report as discussed in the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report.",

        "page_content": "## Performance measure\n\nThe performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Group is adjusted IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns (adjusted operating profit), as described below. This measurement basis distinguishes adjusted operating profit from other constituents of total profit or loss for the year as follows:\n\n- -Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business. This includes the impact of short-term market effects on/uni00A0the/uni00A0carrying value of Jackson's guarantee liabilities and related derivatives as explained below;\n- -Amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business. This comprises principally the charge for the adjustments arising on the purchase of REALIC in 2012; and\n- -Gain or loss on corporate transactions, such as in 2020 the effect of certain of the Group's reinsurance arrangements and costs associated with/uni00A0the work to plan for the separation of Jackson, and in 2019 disposals undertaken and costs connected to the demerger of M&G plc from Prudential plc.\n\n## Determination of adjusted operating profit for investment and liability movements (a)  With-profits business\n\nFor Asia's with-profits business in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, the adjusted operating profit reflects the shareholders' share in the bonuses declared to policyholders. Value movements in the underlying assets of the with-profits funds only affect the shareholder results through indirect effects of investment performance on declared policyholder bonuses and therefore, do not affect directly the determination of/uni00A0adjusted operating profit.\n\n## (b)  Unit-linked business including the US variable annuity separate accounts\n\nThe policyholder unit liabilities are directly reflective of the underlying asset value movements. Accordingly, the adjusted operating profit reflect/uni00A0the current year value movements in both the unit liabilities and the backing assets.\n\n## (c)  US general account business\n\nThe adjusted operating profit for Jackson included in the Group's accounts is based on information reviewed by the GEC on an IFRS basis. This/uni00A0will differ from the financial information that Jackson will report as part of the demerger process, which will be prepared under US GAAP and/uni00A0will be based on the information local management reviews in preparation for them becoming a standalone entity.\n\nJackson's variable and fixed index annuity business has guarantee liabilities which are measured on a combination of fair value and other US GAAP derived principles. These liabilities are subject to an extensive derivative programme to manage equity and interest rate exposures whose fair value movements pass through the income statement each year.\n\nThe following value movements for Jackson's variable and fixed index annuity business are excluded from adjusted operating profit. See note B1.2:\n\n- -Fair value movements for equity-based derivatives;\n- -Fair value movements for guaranteed benefit options for the 'not for life' portion of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) and/uni00A0fixed index annuity business, and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB) reinsurance (see below);\n- -Movements in the accounts carrying value of Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB), GMIB and the 'for life' portion of GMWB liabilities, (see below) for which, under the 'grandfathered' US GAAP applied under IFRS for Jackson's insurance assets and liabilities, the/uni00A0measurement basis gives rise to a muted impact of current year market movements (ie they are relatively insensitive to the effect of/uni00A0current/uni00A0year equity market and interest rate changes);\n- -A portion of the fee assessments as well as claim payments, in respect of guarantee liabilities; and\n- -Related amortisation of DAC for each of the above items.\n\n## Guaranteed benefit options for the 'not for life' portion of GMWB and equity index options for the fixed index annuity business\n\nThe 'not for life' portion of GMWB guaranteed benefit option liabilities is measured under the US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39 under which the projected future growth rate of the account balance is based on the greater of US Treasury rates and current swap rates (rather than expected rates of return) with only a portion of the expected future guarantee fees included. The discount rates applied in determining the value of these liabilities is actively updated each year based on market observed rates and after allowing for Jackson's own credit risk. Reserve value movements on these liabilities are sensitive to changes to levels of equity markets, implied volatility and interest rates. The equity index option for/uni00A0fixed index annuity business is measured under the US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39 under which the projected future growth is based on current swap rates.\n\n## Guaranteed benefit option for variable annuity guarantee minimum income benefit\n\nThe GMIB liability, which is substantially reinsured, subject to a deductible and annual claim limits, is accounted for using 'grandfathered' US GAAP. This accounting basis substantially does not recognise the effects of market movements. The corresponding reinsurance asset is measured under the 'grandfathered' US GAAP basis applied for IFRS in a manner consistent with IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and/uni00A0Measurement', and the asset is therefore recognised at fair value. As the GMIB is economically reinsured, the mark-to-market element of/uni00A0the/uni00A0reinsurance asset is included as a component of short-term fluctuations in investment returns.\n\n## (d)  Policyholder liabilities that are sensitive to market conditions\n\nUnder IFRS, the degree to which the carrying values of liabilities to policyholders are sensitive to current market conditions varies between business units depending upon the nature of the 'grandfathered' measurement basis.\n\nMovements in liabilities for some types of business do require bifurcation between the elements that relate to longer-term market condition and short-term effects to ensure that at the net level (ie after allocated investment return and charge for policyholder benefits) the adjusted operating profit reflects longer-term market returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## B1 Analysis of performance by segment continued\n\n## B1.3 Determining operating segments and performance measure of operating segments continued\n\nFor certain Asia non-participating business, for example in Hong Kong, the economic features are more akin to asset management products with/uni00A0policyholder liabilities reflecting asset shares over the contract term. Consequently, for these products, the charge for policyholder benefits in the adjusted operating profit reflects the asset share feature rather than volatile movements that would otherwise be reflected if the local regulatory basis (as applied for the IFRS balance sheet) was used.\n\nFor other types of Asia non-participating business, expected longer-term investment returns and interest rates are used to determine the movement in policyholder liabilities for determining adjusted operating profit. This ensures assets and liabilities are reflected on a consistent basis.\n\n## (e)  Assets backing other shareholder-financed long-term insurance business\n\nExcept in the case of assets backing liabilities which are directly matched (such as unit-linked business) adjusted operating profit for assets backing shareholder-financed business is determined on the basis of expected longer-term investment returns. Longer-term investment returns comprise actual income receivable for the year (interest/dividend income) and for both debt and equity-type securities longer-term capital returns.\n\n## Debt securities and loans\n\nAs a general principle, for debt securities and loans, the longer-term capital returns comprise two elements:\n\n- -Risk margin reserve based charge for the expected level of defaults for the period, which is determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio. The difference between impairment losses in the reporting period and the risk margin reserve charge to the adjusted operating profit is reflected in short-term fluctuations in investment returns; and\n- -The amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses to adjusted operating profit to the date when sold bonds would have otherwise matured.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the level of unamortised interest-related realised gains and losses related to previously sold bonds for the Group's insurance operations in Asia and the US was a net gain of $1,725 million (31 December 2019: net gain of $916 million).\n\nFor Asia insurance operations, realised gains and losses are principally interest related. Accordingly, all realised gains and losses to date for/uni00A0these operations are amortised over the period to the date those securities would otherwise have matured, with no explicit risk margin reserve/uni00A0charge.\n\nFor US insurance operations, Jackson has used the ratings by Nationally Recognised Statistical Ratings Organisations (NRSRO) or ratings resulting from the regulatory ratings detail issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to determine the average annual risk margin reserve to apply to debt securities held to back general account business. Debt securities held to back separate account and/uni00A0reinsurance funds withheld are not subject to risk margin reserve charge. Further details of the risk margin reserve charge, as well as the amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses, for Jackson are shown in note B1.2.\n\n## Equity-type securities\n\nFor equity-type securities, the longer-term rates of return are estimates of the long-term trend investment returns for income and capital having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations. Different rates apply to different categories of equity-type securities.\n\nFor Asia insurance operations, investments in equity securities held for non-linked shareholder-backed business amounted to $4,954 million as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $3,473 million). The longer-term rates of return applied in 2020 ranged from 5.1 per cent to 16.9 per cent (31 December 2019: 5.0 per cent to 17.6 per cent) with the rates applied varying by business unit. These rates are broadly stable from year to year but may be different between regions, reflecting, for example, differing expectations of inflation in each local business unit. The/uni00A0assumptions are for the returns expected to apply in equilibrium conditions. The assumed rates of return do not reflect any cyclical variability in economic performance and are not set by reference to prevailing asset valuations. The longer-term investment returns for the Asia insurance joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method are determined on a similar basis as the other Asia insurance operations described above.\n\nFor US insurance operations, as at 31 December 2020, the equity-type securities for non-separate account operations amounted to $2,128 million (31 December 2019: $1,481 million). For these operations, the longer-term rates of return for income and capital applied in 2020 and 2019, which reflect the combination of the average risk-free rates over the year and appropriate risk premiums are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2020         | 2019         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Equity-type securities such as common and preferred stock and portfolio holdings in mutual funds  | 4.8% to 5.8% | 5.5% to 6.7% |\n| Other equity-type securities such as investments in limited partnerships and private equity funds | 6.8% to 7.8% | 7.5% to 8.7% |\n\n## Derivative value movements\n\nGenerally, derivative value movements are excluded from adjusted operating profit. The exception is where the derivative value movements broadly offset changes in the accounting value of other assets and liabilities included in adjusted operating profit. The principal example of derivatives whose value movements are excluded from adjusted operating profit arises in Jackson.\n\nEquity-based derivatives held by Jackson are as discussed in section (c) above. Non-equity based derivatives held by Jackson are part of a/uni00A0broad-based hedging programme for features of Jackson's bond portfolio (for which value movements are booked in the statement of other comprehensive income rather than the income statement), product liabilities (for which US GAAP accounting as 'grandfathered' under IFRS 4 does not fully reflect the economic features being hedged), and the interest rate exposure attaching to equity-based product options.",

Generally,/uni00A0realised gains and losses are included in adjusted operating profit with temporary unrealised gains and losses being included in short-term fluctuations. In some instances, realised gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments are amortised to adjusted operating profit over a time period that reflects the underlying economic substance of the arrangements.\n\n## B1.4 Segmental income statement\n\nPremiums and annuity considerations for conventional and other protection type insurance policies are recognised as revenue when due. Premiums and annuity considerations for linked policies and other investment type policies are recognised as revenue when received or, in the case of unitised or unit-linked policies, when units are issued. These amounts exclude premium taxes and similar duties where Prudential collects and settles taxes borne by the policyholder.\n\nPolicy fees charged on linked policies for mortality, morbidity, asset management and policy administration are recognised when related services are provided.\n\nClaims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders, deaths and other claim events. Maturity claims are recorded as charges on the policy maturity date. Annuity claims are recorded when each annuity instalment becomes due for payment. Surrenders are charged to the income statement when paid. Death and other claims are generally recorded when notified with additional contract liabilities held, where appropriate, for/uni00A0' incurred but not reported' (IBNR) claims.\n\n|                                                                                                                       | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m        | 2020  $m                 | 2020  $m    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n|                                                                                                                       | Asia       | US         | Total   segment | Unallocated to a segment | Group total |\n| Gross premiums earned                                                                                                 | 23,341     | 19,026     | 42,367          | 154                      | 42,521      |\n| Outward reinsurance premiums  note (i)                                                                                | (1,615)    | (30,584)   | (32,199)        | (10)                     | (32,209)    |\n| Earned premiums, net of reinsurance                                                                                   | 21,726     | (11,558)   | 10,168          | 144                      | 10,312      |\n| Other income  note (ii)                                                                                               | 609        | 55         | 664             | 6                        | 670         |\n| Total external revenue  notes (iii), (iv)                                                                             | 22,335     | (11,503)   | 10,832          | 150                      | 10,982      |\n| Intra-group revenue                                                                                                   | -

Movements in unrealised appreciation or depreciation of debt securities designated as available-for-sale are recorded in other comprehensive income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on investments. Dividends on equity securities are recognised on the ex-dividend date and rental income is recognised on an accrual basis.\n\n|                                                                                                                                     | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Realised and unrealised gains (losses) on securities at fair value through profit or loss                                           | 40,070     | 49,809     |\n| Realised and unrealised (losses) gains on derivatives at fair value through profit or loss                                          | (3,691)    | (5,825)    |\n| Realised gains on available-for-sale securities, including impairment previously recognised in other  comprehensive/uni00A0income * | 3,371      | 185        |\n| Realised gains (losses) on loans                                                                                                    | 43         | (3)        |\n| Dividends                                                                                                                           | 1,249      | 1,000      |\n| Other investment (loss) income                                                                                                      | (428)      | (218)      |\n| Other investment return                                                                                                             | 40,614     | 44,948     |\n\nRealised gains and losses on the Group's investments for 2020 recognised in the income statement amounted to a net gain of $2.8 billion (2019:/uni00A0a/uni00A0net loss of $2.0 billion).\n\n## B1.6 Additional analysis of performance by segment components\n\n## (a) Asia\n\n|                                                                                                            | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m         | 2020  $m     | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                                                            | Insurance  | Asset management | Eliminations | Total      | Total      |\n| Earned premiums, net of reinsurance                                                                        | 21,726     | -

The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to value all options, and financial equivalence to value all awards other than those which have TSR performance conditions attached (some Prudential LTIP and RSP awards) for which the Group uses a Monte Carlo model in order to allow for the impact of these conditions. These models are used to calculate fair values for share options and awards at the grant date based on the quoted market price of the/uni00A0stock at the measurement date, the amount, if any, that the employees are required to pay, the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and exercise prices.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The Prudential specific at-the-money implied volatilities are adjusted to allow for the different terms and discounted exercise price on SAYE options by using information on the volatility surface of the FTSE 100.\n\nRisk-free interest rates are taken from swap spot rates with projection terms matching the corresponding vesting periods. For awards with a/uni00A0TSR condition, volatilities and correlations between Prudential and a basket of 12 competitor companies is required. For grants in 2020, the/uni00A0average volatility for the basket of competitors was 41.40 per cent (2019: 23.10 per cent). Correlations for the basket are calculated for each pairing from the log of daily TSR returns for the three years prior to the valuation date. Market implied volatilities are used for both Prudential and/uni00A0the basket of competitors.

        "page_content": "## B3 Tax charge\n\nPrudential is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years. The positions taken in tax returns where applicable tax regulation is/uni00A0subject to interpretation are recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept those positions. Otherwise, provisions are established based on management's estimate and judgement of the likely amount of the liability, or recovery, by providing for the single best estimate of the most likely outcome or the weighted average expected value where there are multiple outcomes.\n\nThe total tax charge includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders. The tax expense attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds. In certain jurisdictions, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders' profits and on their policyholders' insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products. Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Group's consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.\n\nDeferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences. IAS 12 'Income Taxes' does not require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax/uni00A0rates (and laws) that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## B3.1 Total tax charge by nature\n\nThe total tax (charge) credit in the income statement is as follows:\n\n|                                                           | 2020        | 2020         | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Tax charge                                                | Current tax | Deferred tax | Total      | Total      |\n| Attributable to shareholders:                             |             |              |            |            |\n| Asia operations                                           | (229)       | (209)        | (438)      | (468)      |\n| US operations                                             | 59          | 408          | 467        | 345        |\n| Other operations                                          | 8           | -            | 8          | 154        |\n| Tax (charge) credit attributable to shareholders' returns | (162)       | 199          | 37         | 31         |\n| Attributable to policyholders:                            |             |              |            |            |\n| Asia operations                                           | (152)       | (119)        | (271)      | (365)      |\n| Total tax (charge) credit                                 | (314)       | 80           | (234)      | (334)      |\n\nThe tax credit attributable to shareholders' returns of $37 million is consistent with the tax credit arising in 2019 ($31 million), reflecting the tax credit on US derivative losses largely offsetting the tax charge on Asia profits.\n\nThe reconciliation of the expected to actual tax charge attributable to shareholders is provided in B3.2 below. The tax charge attributable to policyholders of $271 million above is equal to the profit before tax attributable to policyholders of $271 million. This is the result of accounting for policyholder income after the deduction of expenses and movement on unallocated surpluses on an after-tax basis.\n\nThe total tax (charge) credit comprises:\n\n|                                                                                                                 | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current tax expense:                                                                                            |            |            |\n| Corporation tax                                                                                                 | (445)      | (589)      |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                                                           | 131        | 28         |\n| Total current tax charge                                                                                        | (314)      | (561)      |\n| Deferred tax arising from:                                                                                      |            |            |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                                                               | 33         | 235        |\n| Impact of changes in local statutory tax rates                                                                  | (1)        | 7          |\n| Credit in respect of a previously unrecognised tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference from a prior period | 48         | (15)       |\n| Total deferred tax credit                                                                                       | 80         | 227        |\n| Total tax charge                                                                                                | (234)      | (334)      |\n\nThe $131 million of adjustments in respect of prior years primarily relates to US operations from the true up of the 2019 tax provision following finalisation and submission of the 2019 corporate income tax return during 2020 and the carry back of losses under the CARES Act.\n\nIn 2020, a tax charge of $102 million (2019: charge of $709 million) has been taken through other comprehensive income. The tax charge principally relates to an increase in the market value on securities of US insurance operations classified as available-for-sale partially offset by/uni00A0a/uni00A0ta x/uni00A0credit arising on the recycling of gains to the income statement arising on the transaction with Athene.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The $106 million (2019: $125 million) reconciling item in US operations reflects the impact of the dividend received deduction on the taxation of profits from variable annuity business.\n- (iii) The $146 million (2019: $46 million) adverse reconciling item in unrecognised tax losses reflects losses arising where it is unlikely that relief for the losses will be available in future periods. (iv) Profit before tax includes Prudential's share of profit after tax from the joint ventures and associates. Therefore, the actual tax charge does not include tax arising from profit or loss of joint ventures and associates and is reflected as a reconciling item.\n- (v) The $158 million prior year adjustment in US operations comprises the truing up from the 2019 tax provision computed in the 2019 accounts to the submitted 2019 tax return and a/uni00A0number of/uni00A0one-off adjustments to prior year deferred tax balances.\n\n|                                                                                   | 2020  $m

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group's only class of potentially dilutive ordinary shares are those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the year. No/uni00A0adjustment is made if the impact is anti-dilutive overall.\n\nThe weighted average number of shares for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share in 2020 is set out as below:\n\n| Number of shares (in millions)                                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Weighted average number of shares for calculation of basic earnings per share           | 2,597  | 2,587  |\n| Shares under option at end of year                                                      | 2      | 4      |\n| Shares that would have been issued at fair value on assumed option price at end of year | (2)    | (4)    |\n| Weighted average number of shares for calculation of diluted earnings per share         | 2,597  | 2,587  |\n\n## B5 Dividends\n\n|                                                 | 2020            | 2020   | 2019            | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|--------|\n|                                                 | Cents per share | $m     | Cents per share | $m     |\n| Dividends relating to reporting year:           |                 |        |                 |        |\n| First interim ordinary dividend                 | 5.37\u00a2           | 140    | 20.29\u00a2          | 528    |\n| Second interim ordinary dividend                | 10.73\u00a2          | 280    | 25.97\u00a2          | 675    |\n| Total                                           | 16.10\u00a2          | 420    | 46.26\u00a2          | 1,203  |\n| Dividends paid in reporting year:               |                 |        |                 |        |\n| Current year first interim ordinary dividend    | 5.37\u00a2           | 140    | 20.29\u00a2          | 526    |\n| Second interim ordinary dividend for prior year | 25.97\u00a2          | 674    | 42.89\u00a2          | 1,108  |\n| Total                                           | 31.34\u00a2          | 814    | 63.18\u00a2          | 1,634  |\n\nFirst and second interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.

The second interim ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 December 2020 of 10.73 cents per ordinary share will be paid on 14 May 2021 to/uni00A0shareholders included on the UK and HK registers respectively, on 26 March 2021 (Record Date) and to the Holders of US American Depositary Receipts as at 26 March 2021. The second interim ordinary dividend will be paid on or about 21 May 2021 to shareholders with shares standing to the credit of their securities accounts with The Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP) on the Record Date.\n\nShareholders holding shares on the UK or Hong Kong share registers will continue to receive their dividend payments in either GBP or HKD respectively, unless they elect otherwise. Shareholders holding shares on the UK or Hong Kong registers may elect to receive dividend payments in USD. Elections must be made through the relevant UK or Hong Kong share registrar on or before 23 April 2021. The corresponding amount per share in GBP and HKD is expected to be announced on or about 5 May 2021. The USD to GBP and HKD conversion rates will be determined by the actual rates achieved by Prudential buying those currencies prior to the subsequent announcement. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) will continue to receive their dividend payments in USD. Shareholders holding an interest in Prudential shares through The Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP) in Singapore will continue to receive their dividend payments in SGD at an exchange rate determined by CDP. Shareholders on the UK register are eligible to participate in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.",

The 2019 comparative information, in particular that relating to investments, has been re-presented from previously published information to conform to the current year format and the altered approach to credit ratings analysis described below.\n\nDebt securities are analysed below according to the issuing government for sovereign debt and to credit ratings for the rest of the securities. From half year 2020, to align more closely with the internal risk management analysis, the Group altered the compilation of its credit ratings analysis to use the middle of the Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch ratings, where available. Where ratings are not available from these rating agencies, NAIC ratings (for the US), local external rating agencies' ratings and lastly internal ratings have been used. Securities with none of the ratings listed above are classified as unrated and included under the 'below BBB- and unrated' category. The total securities (excluding sovereign debt) that were unrated at 31 December 2020 were $780  million (31 December 2019: $648 million). Previously, Standard & Poor's ratings were used where available and if not, Moody's and then Fitch were used as alternatives. Additionally, government debt is shown separately from the rating breakdowns in order to provide a more focused view of the credit portfolio.\n\nIn the table below, AAA is the highest possible rating. Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB- ratings. Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as below BBB-.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Investments in structured securities are subject to a review of their future estimated cash flows, including expected and stress case scenarios, to identify potential shortfalls in contractual payments (both interest and principal). Impairment charges are recorded on structured securities when the Company forecasts a contractual payment shortfall. Situations where such a shortfall would not lead to a recognition of a loss are rare. The impairment loss reflects the difference between the fair value and book value.\n\nIn 2020, the Group realised gross losses on sales of available-for-sale securities of $193 million (2019: $70 million) with 69 per cent (2019: 51 per cent) of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of the top 10 individual issuers, which were disposed of to limit future credit loss exposure. Of the $193 million (2019: $70 million), $148 million (2019: $28 million) relates to losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating securities.\n\nThe effect of changes in the key assumptions that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3.1. A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities accounted for on an available-for-sale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.\n\nFor 2020, the amount of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale under IFRS in an unrealised loss position was $144 million (2019: $27 million). Note B1.2 provides further details on the impairment charges and unrealised losses of Jackson's available-for-sale securities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## C1 Group assets and liabilities by business type continued\n\n## C1.2 Additional analysis of US mortgage loans\n\nIn the US, mortgage loans of $7,833 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $9,904 million) are all commercial mortgage loans that are secured by the following property types: industrial, multi-family residential, suburban office, retail or hotel. The average loan size is $18.5 million (31 December 2019: $19.3 million). The portfolio has a current estimated average loan to value of 54 per cent (31 December 2019: 54 per cent).\n\nAt 31 December 2020, Jackson had mortgage loans with a carrying value of $493 million (31 December 2019: nil) where the contractual terms of the agreements had been restructured to grant forbearance for a period of six to fourteen months. Under IAS 39, restructured loans are reviewed for impairment with an impairment recorded if the expected cash flows under the newly restructured terms discounted at the original yield (the pre-structured interest rate) are below the carrying value of the loan. No impairment is recorded for these loans in 2020 as the expected cash flows and interest rate did not materially change under the restructured terms.\n\n## C2 Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group holds financial investments in accordance with IAS 39, whereby subject to specific criteria, financial instruments are required to be accounted for under one of the following categories:\n\n- -Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - this comprises assets and liabilities designated by management as fair value through profit or loss on inception and derivatives. This includes instruments that are managed and the performance evaluated on a fair value basis and includes liabilities related to net assets attributable to unit holders of consolidated investment funds and, in/uni00A0Asia, policyholder liabilities for investment contracts without discretionary participation features. All investments within this category are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment return in the income statement;\n- -Financial investments on an available-for-sale basis - this comprises assets that are designated by management as available-for-sale and/or do not fall into any of the other categories. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs. Available-for-sale assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income is recognised on an effective interest basis in the income statement. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Except for foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost of the debt securities, which are included in the income statement, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. Upon disposal or impairment, accumulated unrealised gains and losses are transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement as realised gains or losses; and\n- -Loans and receivables - except for those designated as fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale, these instruments comprise non-quoted investments that have fixed or determinable payments. These instruments include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits, loans to policyholders and other unsecured loans and receivables. These investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, these instruments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nThe Group uses the trade date method to account for regular purchases and sales of financial assets.\n\n## C2.1 Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair values of the financial instruments for which fair valuation is required under IFRS Standards are determined by the use of current market bid prices for exchange-quoted investments, or by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers and pricing services or by using appropriate valuation techniques.\n\nThe estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arm's-length transaction. This amount is determined using quoted prices if exchange listed, quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.\n\nOther than the loans which have been designated at fair value through profit or loss, the carrying value of loans and receivables is presented net of provisions for impairment. The fair value of loans is estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received. The discount rate used is updated for the market rate of interest where applicable.\n\nThe fair value of the subordinated and senior debt issued by the parent company is determined using quoted prices from independent third parties.\n\nThe fair value of financial liabilities (other than subordinated debt, senior debt and derivative financial instruments) is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.\n\n## Valuation approach for level 2 fair valued assets and liabilities\n\nA significant proportion of the Group's level 2 assets are corporate bonds, structured securities and other non-national government debt securities. These assets, in line with market practice, are generally valued using a designated independent pricing service or quote from third-party brokers. These valuations are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as comparison to multiple pricing sources where available, monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis on prices achieved on subsequent trades.\n\nWhen prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced directly from brokers. Prudential seeks to obtain a number of quotes from different brokers so as to obtain the most comprehensive information available on their executability. Where quotes are sourced directly from brokers, the price used in the valuation is normally selected from one of the quotes based on a number of factors, including the timeliness and regularity of the quotes and the accuracy of the quotes considering the spreads provided. The selected quote is the one which best represents an executable quote for the security at the measurement date.",

        "page_content": "Generally, no adjustment is made to the prices obtained from independent third parties. Adjustment is made in only limited circumstances, where it is determined that the third-party valuations obtained do not reflect fair value (eg either because the value is stale and/or the values are/uni00A0extremely diverse in range). These are usually securities which are distressed or that could be subject to a debt restructure or where reliable market prices are no longer available due to an inactive market or market dislocation. In these instances, prices are derived using internal valuation techniques including those as described below in this note with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date. The techniques used require a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates. Examples of such variables include an average credit spread based on the corporate bond universe and the relevant duration of the asset being valued. Prudential determines the input assumptions based on the best available information at the measurement dates. Securities valued in such manner are classified as level 3 where these significant inputs are not based on observable market data.\n\n## Valuation approach for level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities\n\nInvestments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which by their nature do not have an externally quoted price based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions, eg market illiquidity. The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arm's-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option-adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.\n\nThe Group's valuation policies, procedures and analyses for instruments categorised as level 3 are overseen by Business Unit committees as part of the Group's wider financial reporting governance processes. The procedures undertaken include approval of valuation methodologies, verification processes, and resolution of significant or complex valuation issues. In undertaking these activities, the Group makes use of the extensive expertise of its asset management functions. In addition, the Group has minimum standards for independent price verification to ensure valuation accuracy is regularly independently verified. Adherence to this policy is monitored across the business units.\n\n## C2.2 Fair value measurement hierarchy of Group assets and liabilities\n\n## (i) Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the statement of financial position\n\nThe table below shows the assets and liabilities carried at fair value analysed by level of the IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' defined fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy is based on the inputs to the fair value measurement and reflects the lowest level input that is significant to that measurement.\n\nAll assets and liabilities held at fair value are classified as fair value through profit or loss, except for $34,650 million (31 December 2019: $58,302 million) of debt securities classified as available-for-sale, principally in the US operations. All assets and liabilities held at fair value are measured on a recurring basis. As of 31 December 2020, the Group did not have any financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\n|                                                                                                   | 31 Dec 2020  $m                                       | 31 Dec 2020  $m                                                              | 31 Dec 2020  $m                                                              | 31 Dec 2020  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                                   | Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets | Level 2 Valuation  based on  significant unobservable market inputs note (i) | Level 3 Valuation  based on  significant  observable market inputs note (ii) | Total             |\n| Loans                                                                                             | -

 Liabilities of $(494) million (31 December 2019: $(2) million) for the net asset value attributable to external unit holders in respect of consolidated investment funds, which are non-recourse to the Group. These liabilities are valued by reference to the underlying assets; and\n\n- -  A net assets of $395 million (31 December 2019: $258 million) is held by the Group's Asia participating funds and therefore shareholders' profit and equity are not impacted by movements in/uni00A0the valuation of these financial instruments; and\n- -  A net asset of $1,613 million (31 December 2019: $1,323 million) is held to support non-linked shareholder-backed business, all of which are externally valued and are therefore inherently less subjective than internal valuations. These instruments consist primarily of private equity investments held by Jackson as described above. If the value of all these level 3 financial instruments decreased by 20 per cent, the change in valuation would be $(319) million (31 December 2019: $(264) million), which would reduce shareholders' equity by this amount before tax. All of this amount would pass through the income statement substantially as part of short-term fluctuations in investment returns outside of/uni00A0adjusted operating profit.",

Transfers are deemed to have occurred when there is/uni00A0a/uni00A0material change in the observed valuation inputs or a change in the level of trading activities of the securities.\n\nDuring 2020, the transfers between levels within the Group's portfolio, were primarily transfers from level 1 to level 2 of $3,927 million (2019:/uni00A0$678 million) and transfers from level 2 to level 1 of $1,631 million (2019: $1,121 million). These transfers which relate to equity securities and debt securities arose to reflect the change in/uni00A0the observed valuation inputs and in certain cases, the change in the level of trading activities of/uni00A0the securities. There were transfers into level 3 of $53 million in the year (2019: nil).\n\n## Reconciliation of movements in level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\nThe following table reconciles the value of level 3 fair valued assets and liabilities at 1 January 2020 to that presented at 31 December 2020. Total investment return recorded in the income statement represents interest and dividend income, realised gains and losses, unrealised gains and losses on the assets classified at fair value through profit and loss and foreign exchange movements on an individual entity's overseas investments.\n\nTotal gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income includes unrealised gains and losses on debt securities held as available-forsale principally within Jackson and foreign exchange movements arising from the retranslation of the Group's overseas subsidiaries and branches.\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m                                                             | 2020  $m         | 2020  $m                                            | 2020  $m                                                                             | 2020  $m                      | 2020  $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n| Reconciliation of movements   in/uni00A0level 3 assets and liabilities   measured at fair value | Loans      | Equity  securities  and holdings  in collective  investment  schemes | Debt  securities | Other  investments  (including  derivative  assets) | Net asset  value  attributable  to unit  holders of  consolidated  investment  funds | Other  financial  liabilities | Total      |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                                                                | 3,587      | 276                                                                  | 6                | 1,301                                               | (2)                                                                                  | (3,760)                       | 1,408      |\n| Total gains (losses) in income statement  note                                                  | (2)        | 4                                                                    | (5)              | (37)                                                | 15                                                                                   | (1)                           | (26)       |\n| Total gains (losses) recorded in other  comprehensive income                                    | -

The Group has no cash flow hedges and, in general, contractual maturities are not considered essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows for these instruments.\n\n## Maturity analysis of investment contracts\n\nThe table below shows the maturity profile for investment contracts based on undiscounted cash flow projections of expected benefit payments.\n\n|             | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   | Maturity profile for investment contracts  $m   |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|             | Total carrying value                            | 1 year  or less                                 | After 1  year to  5 years                       | After 5  years to  10 years                     | After 10  years to  15 years                    | After 15  years to  20 years                    | Over  20 years                                  | T otal  undis- counted  cash flows              |\n| 31 Dec 2020 | 3,658                                           | 519                                             | 1,713                                           | 215                                             | 575                                             | 710                                             | 17                                              | 3,749                                           |\n| 31 Dec 2019 | 4,366                                           | 600                                             | 2,015                                           | 534                                             | 350                                             | 961                                             | 12                                              | 4,472                                           |\n\nThe undiscounted cash flows in the maturity profile shown above excludes contracts which have no stated maturity but which are repayable on/uni00A0demand. 2019 cash flows have been adjusted to show them on a consistent basis.\n\nMost investment contracts have options to surrender early, often subject to surrender or other penalties. Therefore, most contracts can be/uni00A0said to/uni00A0have a contractual maturity of less than one year, but the additional charges and term of the contracts mean these are unlikely to be exercised in/uni00A0practice and the more useful information is to present information on expected payment.\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's financial assets are held to back the Group's policyholder liabilities. Although asset/liability matching is an important component of managing policyholder liabilities (both those classified as insurance and those classified as investments), this profile is/uni00A0mainly relevant for managing market risk rather than liquidity risk. Within each business unit, this asset/liability matching is performed on a/uni00A0portfolio-by-portfolio basis.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk, a large proportion of the policyholder liabilities contain discretionary surrender values or surrender charges, meaning that many of the Group's liabilities are expected to be held for the long term. Much of the Group's investment portfolios are in marketable securities, which can therefore be converted quickly to liquid assets.\n\nFor the reasons provided above, an analysis of the Group's assets by contractual maturity is not considered meaningful to evaluate the nature and extent of the Group's liquidity risk.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

The collateral in place in relation to derivatives is described in note (iii) below. Note C1.2 describes the security for the loans held by the Group. The Group's exposure to credit risk is further discussed in note C6 below.\n\nOf the total loans and receivables held, $8 million (31 December 2019: $7 million) are past their due date but are not impaired. Of the total past due but not impaired, $1 million are less than one year past their due date (31 December 2019: $1 million). The Group expects full recovery of these loans and receivables.\n\nThere are no financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated in both years.\n\nIn addition, the Group did not take possession of any other collateral held as security in both years.\n\nFurther details of collateral in place in relation to derivatives, securities lending, repurchase agreements and other transactions are provided in/uni00A0note (iii) below.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group held 9 per cent (31 December 2019: 8 per cent) of its financial assets and 30 per cent (31 December 2019: 25 per cent) of its financial liabilities in currencies, mainly USD, other than the functional currency of the relevant business units or the currency to/uni00A0which the functional currency is pegged (eg financial assets and liabilities of USD denominated business in Hong Kong). The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts and currency swaps as described in/uni00A0note (ii) below.\n\nThe amount of exchange loss recognised in the income statement in 2020, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, is $33 million (2019: $72 million).\n\n## (ii) Derivatives and hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.\n\nThe Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IAS 39. The Group has no fair value and cash flows hedges under IAS 39 at 31 December 2020 and 2019. All derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried at fair value, with/uni00A0movements in fair value being recorded in the income statement.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are embedded within other non-derivative host financial instruments and insurance contracts to create hybrid instruments. Embedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are accounted for under IFRS 4. Where economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host instrument, and/uni00A0where the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value as a derivative measured in accordance with IAS 39.\n\nIn addition, the Group applies the option under IFRS 4 to not separate and fair value surrender options embedded in host contracts and with-profits investment contracts whose strike price is either a fixed amount or a fixed amount plus interest.\n\n## Derivatives held and their purpose\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of exchange traded and over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, including futures, options, forward contracts, swaps and swaptions.\n\nAll over-the-counter derivative transactions, with the exception of transactions in some Asia operations, are conducted under standardised ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc) master agreements and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.\n\nThe majority of the Group's derivatives are held by Jackson. Derivatives are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and management of exposure to various markets in accordance with the Group's investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks. The Group also uses interest rate derivatives to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility. In particular:\n\n- -US operations hold large amounts of interest-rate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of defaults is expected. These businesses have purchased some swaptions to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets; and\n- -Some products, especially in the US, have guarantee features linked to equity indices. A mismatch between guaranteed product liabilities and/uni00A0the performance of the underlying assets exposes the Group to equity index risk. In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to better match asset performance with liabilities under equity-indexed products.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information on Jackson derivative programme\n\nJackson enters into financial derivative transactions, including those noted below, to reduce and manage business risks. These transactions manage the risk of a change in the value, yield, price, cash flows or quantity of, or a degree of exposure, with respect to assets, liabilities or future cash flows, which Jackson has acquired or incurred.\n\nJackson uses free-standing derivative instruments for hedging purposes. Additionally, certain liabilities, primarily trust instruments supported by funding agreements, fixed index annuities, certain variable annuity guaranteed benefit features and reinsured Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit variable annuity features are similar to derivatives. Jackson does not account for such items as either fair value or cash flow hedges as might be permitted if the specific hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were followed. Financial derivatives are carried at fair value, including derivatives embedded in certain host liabilities where these are required to be valued separately.\n\nThe principal types of derivatives used by Jackson and their purpose are as follows:\n\n| Derivative                                                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps                                       | These generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating payments over the period for which Jackson holds the  instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These agreements are used to hedge Jackson's  exposure to movements in interest rates.                                                                                   |\n| Swaption contracts                                        | These contracts provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to require the writer to pay the present  value of a long-duration interest rate swap at future exercise dates. Jackson both purchases and writes swaptions  in/uni00A0order to hedge against significant movements in interest rates.                                         |\n| Treasury futures  contracts                               | These derivatives are used to hedge Jackson's exposure to movements in interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Equity index futures  contracts and equity  index options | These derivatives (including various call and put options and options contingent on interest rates and currency exchange  rates) are used to hedge Jackson's obligations associated with its issuance of certain VA guarantees. Some of these  annuities and guarantees contain embedded options that are fair valued for financial reporting purposes.      |\n| Cross-currency  swaps                                     | Cross-currency swaps, which embody spot and forward currency swaps and additionally, in some cases, interest rate  swaps and equity index swaps, are entered into for the purpose of hedging Jackson's foreign currency denominated  funding agreements supporting trust instrument obligations.                                                             |\n| Credit default swaps                                      | These swaps represent agreements under which the buyer has purchased default protection on certain underlying  corporate bonds held in its portfolio. These contracts allow Jackson to sell the protected bonds at par value to the  counterparty if a default event occurs in exchange for periodic payments made by Jackson for the life of the agreement. |\n\n## Hedging\n\nUp to 31 December 2019, the Group had designated perpetual subordinated capital securities totalling $3.7 billion as a net investment hedge under IAS 39 to hedge the currency risks related to the net investment in Jackson. This net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective in 2019. The Group had no net investment, cash flow or fair value hedges in place during 2020.\n\n## (iii) Derecognition, collateral and offsetting\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group's policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe Group is party to various reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an obligation to resell the securities. The securities are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position but the right to receive the cash paid is recognised as deposits.\n\nThe Group has entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the/uni00A0securities. At 31 December 2020, the fair value of the collateral held in respect of these transactions, which is represented by the purchased securities, was $603 million (31 December 2019: $1,011 million).\n\n## Securities lending and repurchase agreements\n\nThe Group is also party to various securities lending agreements (including repurchase agreements) under which securities are loaned to third/uni00A0parties on a short-term basis. The loaned securities are not derecognised; rather, they continue to be recognised within the appropriate investment classification. To the extent cash collateral is received it is recognised on the statement of financial position with the obligation to repay the cash paid recognised as a liability. Other collateral is not recognised.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group had $2,007 million (31 December 2019: $90 million) of lent securities and assets subject to repurchase agreements. The cash and securities collateral held or pledged under such agreements were $2,047 million (31 December 2019: $95 million).\n\nw\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and repurchase agreements.\n\nThe Group has entered into collateral arrangements in relation to over-the-counter derivative transactions, which permit sale or re-pledging of/uni00A0underlying collateral. The Group has not sold any collateral held or re-pledged any collateral. All over-the-counter derivative transactions, with/uni00A0the exception of transactions in some Asia operations, are conducted under standardised International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements. The collateral management for these transactions is conducted under the usual and customary terms and conditions set out in the Credit Support Annex to the ISDA master agreement.\n\n## Other collateral\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group had pledged collateral of $2,614 million (31 December 2019: $3,299 million) in respect of other transactions. This principally arises from Jackson's membership of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLBI) primarily for the purpose of participating in the bank's collateralised loan advance programme with short-term and long-term funding facilities. The membership requires Jackson to purchase and hold a minimum amount of FHLBI capital stock, plus additional stock based on outstanding advances in the form of either short-term or long-term notes or funding agreements issued to FHLBI.\n\n## Offsetting assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group's derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and due from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. The Group recognises amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe following tables present the gross and net information about the Group's financial instruments subject to master netting arrangements:\n\n|                                              | 31 Dec 2020  $m                          | 31 Dec 2020  $m                                   | 31 Dec 2020  $m                                   | 31 Dec 2020  $m                                   | 31 Dec 2020  $m        |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                              | Gross amount                             | Related amounts not offset in the   balance sheet | Related amounts not offset in the   balance sheet | Related amounts not offset in the   balance sheet |                        |\n|                                              | included in the  balance sheet  note (i) | Financial  instruments  note (ii)                 | Cash  collateral                                  | Securities  collateral  note (iii)                | Net  amount  note (iv) |\n| Financial assets:                            |                                          |                                                   |                                                   |                                                   |                        |\n| Derivative assets                            | 2,523                                    | (122)                                             | (1,249)                                           | (890)                                             | 262                    |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements                | 588                                      | -

Although the ceding of insurance does not relieve the Group from its liability to/uni00A0its policyholders, the Group participates in such agreements largely for the purpose of managing its loss exposure. The Group evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimise its exposure from reinsurer insolvencies. Of the reinsurers' share of insurance contract liabilities balance of $46,595 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $13,856 million), 99 per cent (31 December 2019: 97 per cent) was from reinsurers with rating A- and/uni00A0above by Standard & Poor's or other external rating agencies.\n\nDuring 2020, net commissions received on ceded business for Asia totalled $1,005 million (2019: $355 million) and claims incurred ceded to/uni00A0external reinsurers totalled $432 million (2019: $552 million). The 2020 net commissions received includes $770 million in respect of the reinsurance transaction entered into by the Hong Kong business as discussed in note D1.1. There was $1 million (2019: nil) of deferred gains in/uni00A0the year.\n\nNet commissions received on ceded business for Jackson totalled $1,223 million (2019: $20 million) and claims incurred ceded to external reinsurers totalled $1,663 million (2019: $630 million). The 2020 net commissions received includes $1,203 million in respect of the Athene reinsurance transaction entered into by Jackson as discussed in note D1.1. There was no deferred gains in the year (2019: nil).\n\nF\n\nE",

This is discussed further in the Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer's report.\n- (b) Positive investment-related items and other movements in variable annuity separate account liabilities of $24,346 million for 2020 largely represent positive separate account return following the increase in the US equity market growth in the year and asset gains arising from declining bond yields.\n- (c) Average policyholder liabilities have been based on opening and closing balances, adjusted for any acquisitions, disposals and other corporate transactions arising in the year.

The classification of the contract/uni00A0determines its accounting.\n\nContracts that transfer significant insurance risk to the Group are classified as insurance contracts. This judgement is applied in considering whether the material features of a contract gives rise to the transfer of significant insurance risk, which is made at the point of contract inception and not revisited.\n\nFor the majority of the Group's contracts, classification is based on a readily identifiable scenario that demonstrates a significant difference in cash flows if the covered event occurs (as opposed to does not occur) reducing the level of judgement involved.\n\nContracts that transfer financial risk to the Group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts. Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 4. Investment contracts without such discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39.\n\n| Insurance   business units   | Insurance contracts and   investment contracts with  discretionary participation features                               | Investment contracts without   discretionary participation features                       |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Asia                         | -With-profits contracts -Unit-linked policies -Health and protection  policies -Non-participating term   contracts      | -Minor amounts for a number  of/uni00A0small/uni00A0categories of business                |\n| US                           | -Variable annuity contracts -Fixed annuity contracts -Fixed index annuity   contracts -Group pay-out annuity  contracts | -Guaranteed investment contracts  (GICs)  -Minor amounts of 'annuity  certain'  contracts |\n\n## C3.4(a) Asia\n\n| Contract type   | Description and material features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Determination of liabilities                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| With-profits    | Provides savings and/or protection where the basic sum  assured can be enhanced by a profit share (or bonus)  from the underlying fund as determined at the discretion  of the local business unit.

        "page_content": "## C4 Intangible assets\n\n## C4.1 Goodwill\n\n## Business combination\n\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to/uni00A0fair value at the date of purchase. The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. The Group chooses the full goodwill method or the partial goodwill method to calculate goodwill on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Expenses related to acquiring new subsidiaries are charged to the income statement in the period in which they/uni00A0are incurred and not included in goodwill. Income and expenses of acquired businesses are included in the income statement from the date/uni00A0of/uni00A0acquisition.\n\nWhere the Group writes a put option, which if exercised triggers the purchase of non-controlling interests as part of its business acquisition, the put option is recognised as a financial liability at the acquisition date. Where risks and rewards remain with the non-controlling interests, a/uni00A0corresponding amount is deducted from equity. Any subsequent changes to the carrying amount of the put option liability are also recognised/uni00A0within equity.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is capitalised and carried on the Group consolidated statement of financial position as an intangible asset at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nGoodwill shown on the consolidated statement of financial position represents amounts attributable to shareholders and are allocated to/uni00A0businesses in Asia and Africa in respect of both acquired asset management and life businesses. There has been no impairment as at 31 December 2020 and 2019.\n\n|                                                  | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Carrying value at 1 Jan                          | 969        | 2,365      |\n| Removal of discontinued UK and Europe operations | -          | (1,731)    |\n| Additions in the year                            | -          | 299        |\n| Exchange differences                             | (8)        | 36         |\n| Carrying value at 31 Dec                         | 961        | 969        |\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other groups of assets and thus is assigned to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. These cash-generating units (CGUs) are based upon how management monitors the business and represent the lowest level to which goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Of the carrying value at 31 December 2020, $513 million relates to asset management business in Thailand. Other goodwill amounts are allocated across CGUs in Asia and Africa operations, which are not individually material.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the CGU's carrying amount, including any goodwill, with its recoverable amount. The/uni00A0Group's/uni00A0methodology of assessing whether goodwill may be impaired for acquired life and asset management operations is discussed below.\n\nFor acquired life businesses, the Group routinely compares the aggregate of net asset value and acquired goodwill on an IFRS basis of the acquired life business with the value of the current in-force business as determined using the EEV methodology. Any excess of IFRS value over EEV carrying value is then compared with EEV basis value of current and projected future new business to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill in the IFRS statement of financial position may be impaired. The methodology and assumptions underpinning the/uni00A0Group's EEV basis of reporting are included in the EEV basis supplementary information in this Annual Report.\n\nThe goodwill in respect of asset management businesses comprises mainly the goodwill arising from the acquisition of Thanachart Fund Management Co., Ltd (TFund) in 2019 and TMB Asset Management Co., Ltd (TMBAM) in Thailand in 2018. At 31 December 2020, the recoverable amount of these businesses has been determined by calculating the value in use of combined business given the business units are/uni00A0planned to/uni00A0be/uni00A0merged and future forecasts prepared by management assume the combination has been completed, and hence have been prepared as/uni00A0a/uni00A0single CGU. The value in use for Thailand asset management businesses has been calculated using a discounted cash flow valuation.\n\nFor the combined Thailand asset management business, the valuation is based on a number of key assumptions as follows:\n\n- -Cash flow projections based on the latest five-year business plan/forecast;\n- -A constant growth rate of 2.3 per cent on forecast cash flows beyond the terminal year of the cash flow projection period (31 December/uni00A02019:/uni00A02.3 per cent);\n- -The risk discount rate applied in accordance with the nature of the businesses. The pre-tax discount rate applied at/uni00A031 December/uni00A02020/uni00A0is/uni00A09 per cent (31 December 2019: 9 per cent); and\n- -The continuation of asset management contracts on similar terms.\n\nManagement believes that any reasonable change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the asset management businesses acquired to fall below its carrying amount.",

DAC are accounted for as described in note A3.1(c). Other intangible assets, such as distribution rights and software, are valued initially at the price paid to acquire them and are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. For intangibles other than DAC, amortisation follows the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. If the pattern cannot be determined reliably, a straightline method is applied. For software, the amortisation generally represents the licence period of the software acquired. Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the 'acquisition costs and other expenditure' line in the consolidated income statement. Impairment testing is conducted when there is an indication of impairment .\n\n|                                                                                          | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| DAC and other intangible assets attributable to shareholders                             | 20,275            | 17,409            |\n| Other intangible assets, including computer software, attributable to with-profits funds | 70                | 67                |\n| Total of DAC and other intangible assets                                                 | 20,345            | 17,476            |\n\n## (i) DAC and other intangible assets attributable to shareholders\n\nThe DAC and other intangible assets attributable to shareholders comprise:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                          | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| DAC related to insurance contracts as classified under IFRS 4                                                                                                            | 16,182            | 14,206            |\n| DAC related to investment management contracts, including life assurance contracts classified as financial  instruments and investment management contracts under IFRS 4 | 34                | 33                |\n| DAC related to insurance and investment contracts  note (ii)                                                                                                             | 16,216            | 14,239            |\n| Present value of acquired in-force policies for insurance contracts as classified under IFRS 4 (PVIF)                                                                    | 34                | 38                |\n| Distribution rights and other intangibles                                                                                                                                | 4,025             | 3,132             |\n| Present value of acquired in-force (PVIF) and other intangibles attributable to shareholders  note (iii)                                                                 | 4,059             | 3,170             |\n| Total of DAC and other intangible assets  note (a)                                                                                                                       | 20,275            | 17,409            |\n\n## Notes\n\n(a) Total DAC and other intangible assets attributable to shareholders can be further analysed by business operations as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m      | 2020  $m                        |        |        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                | DAC        | DAC           | PVIF and                        |        |        |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                | Asia       | US * note (b) | other  intangibles \u2020 note (iii) | Total  | Total  |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                                                                                                                                               | 1,999      | 12,240        | 3,170                           | 17,409 | 15,008 |\n| Removal of discontinued UK and Europe operations                                                                                                                               | -

Nevertheless, extreme market movements can cause material acceleration or deceleration of amortisation in spite of this dampening effect. It is currently estimated that DAC amortisation will accelerate (decelerate) by $17 million for every 1 per cent under (over) the mean reversion rate (set using the calculation described below to give an average over an 8-year period of 7.15 per cent (2019: 7.4 per cent)) the actual separate account growth rate differs by.\n\nFurthermore, in those periods where the cap or floor is relevant, the mean reversion technique provides no further dampening and additional volatility may result.\n\nIn 2020, the DAC amortisation charge for adjusted operating profit was determined after including a credit for decelerated amortisation of $330 million (2019: credit for deceleration: $280 million). DAC amortisation for variable annuities is sensitive to separate account performance. The deceleration arising in 2020 reflected a mechanical decrease in the projected separate account return for the next five years under the mean-reversion technique. Under this technique, the projected level of return for each of the next five years is adjusted so that in combination with the actual rates of return for the preceding three years (including the current year) the assumed long-term annual separate account return of 7.15 per cent is realised on average over the entire eight-year period.\n\nThe application of the mean reversion formula (described in note A3.1) has the effect of dampening the impact of equity market movements on DAC amortisation while the mean reversion assumption lies within the corridor. At 31 December 2020, it would take approximate movements in separate account values of more than either negative 40 per cent or positive 19 per cent for mean reversion assumption to move outside the corridor.\n\nChanges to the assumed long-term separate account return will also impact the calculation of the DAC balance and could increase or decrease the DAC amortisation charge in a given period. If the assumption for the long-term separate account investment returns (net of external fund management fees) was reduced by 0.5 per cent from 7.15 per cent to 6.65 per cent at/uni00A031 December 2020, the 2020 amortisation charge for adjusted operating profit would have increased by around $70 million with a corresponding reduction in the DAC balance at 31 December 2020. In addition, pre-tax short-term fluctuations in investment returns would reduce by circa $64 million following changes to the policyholder liabilities valued using longer-term equity assumptions under SOP03-1, resulting in a total impact on profit before tax of $134 million.\n\n## (ii) DAC related to insurance and investment contracts\n\nThe movements in DAC relating to insurance and investment contracts are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                          | 2020  $m             | 2020  $m             | 2019  $m             | 2019  $m             |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                                          | Insurance  contracts | Investment contracts | Insurance  contracts | Investment contracts |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                                                                                         | 14,206               | 33                   | 12,758               | 99                   |\n| Removal of discontinued UK and Europe operations                                                                         | -                    | -                    | (62)                 | (72)                 |\n| Additions                                                                                                                | 1,354                | 3                    | 1,411                | 11                   |\n| Amortisation                                                                                                             | 85                   | (4)                  | 699                  | (5)                  |\n| Exchange differences                                                                                                     | 43                   | 2                    | 31                   | -                    |\n| Change in shadow DAC related to movement in unrealised appreciation of debt  securities classified as available-for-sale | 494                  | -                    | (631)                | -                    |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                                                                                                        | 16,182               | 34                   | 14,206               | 33                   |\n\n## Note\n\nAll of the additions for investment contracts are through internal development.

        "page_content": "## C6 Risk and sensitivity analysis continued\n\n## C6.1 Group overview continued\n\nThe profit for the year of asset management operations is sensitive to the level of assets under management, as this significantly affects the value/uni00A0of management fees earned by the business in the current and future periods. Assets under management will rise and fall as market conditions change, with a consequential impact on profitability. Other than this, there is limited sensitivity to market risks since the Group's asset management and other operations do not hold significant financial investments. At 31 December 2020, the financial investments of the other operations are principally short-term investments held by the Group's treasury function for liquidity purposes and so there is limited sensitivity to/uni00A0interest rate movements.\n\nSensitivity analyses of IFRS shareholders' equity to key market and other risks by business unit are provided below. The sensitivity analyses provided show the effect on shareholders' equity to changes in the relevant risk variables, all of which are considered to be reasonably possible at/uni00A0the relevant balance sheet date.\n\nThe sensitivities reflect all consequential impacts from market movements at the valuation date. The sensitivities below only allow for limited management actions such as changes to policyholder bonuses, where applicable. If the economic conditions set out in the sensitivities persisted, the/uni00A0financial impacts may differ to the instantaneous impacts. Given the continuous risk management processes in place, management could take/uni00A0additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses, including (but not limited to) rebalancing investment portfolios, further market risk hedging, increased use of reinsurance, repricing of in-force benefits, changes to new business pricing and the mix of new business being sold.\n\nOther limitations of the sensitivities include: the use of hypothetical market movements that cannot be predicted with any certainty to demonstrate potential risk, which only represent Prudential's view of reasonably possible near-term market changes; the assumption that interest rates in all countries move identically; and the lack of consideration of the inter-relation of interest rates, equity markets and foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Group benefits from diversification benefits achieved through the geographical spread of the Group's operations and, within those operations, through a broad mix of product types. These benefits are not reflected in the simplified sensitivities below. Relevant correlation factors include:\n\n- -Correlation across geographic regions for both financial and non-financial risk factors; and\n- -Correlation across risk factors for longevity risk, expenses, persistency and other risks.\n\nThe geographical diversity of the Group's business means that it has some exposure to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Group has no exposure to currency fluctuation from business units that operate in USD, or currencies pegged to the USD (such as HKD), and reduced exposure to currencies partially managed to the USD within a basket of currencies (such as SGD). Sensitivities to exchange rate movements in the/uni00A0Group's key markets are therefore expected to be limited.\n\n## C6.2 Sensitivity to interest rate risk\n\nThe sensitivities shown below are for movements in risk-free rates (based on local government bond yields at the valuation date) in isolation and/uni00A0are subject to a floor of zero. They do not include movements in credit risk that may affect credit spreads and hence the valuation of debt securities and policyholder liabilities. A one-letter credit downgrade in isolation (ie ignoring any consequential change in valuation) would not have a material impact on IFRS profit or shareholders' equity.\n\nTo reflect the substantial fall and current level of low interest rates in 2020, the estimated sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates at/uni00A031 December 2020 has been updated to a decrease of 0.5 per cent. This compares to a 1 per cent change at 31 December 2019. The/uni00A0estimated/uni00A0sensitivity to a decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2020 is as follows:\n\n|                                      | Asia insurance  $m   | Asia insurance  $m   | US insurance  $m   | US insurance  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| 31 December 2020                     | Decrease  of 0.5%    | Increase  of 1%      | Decrease  of 0.5%  | Increase  of 1%    |\n| Net effect on shareholders' equity * | (1,274)              | (318)                | (594)              | (68)               |\n\nThe estimated sensitivity to a decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2019 was as follows:\n\n|                                      | Asia insurance  $m   | Asia insurance  $m   | US insurance  $m   | US insurance  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| 31 December 2019                     | Decrease  of 1%      | Increase  of 1%      | Decrease  of 1%    | Increase  of 1%    |\n| Net effect on shareholders' equity * | (702)                | (718)                | 20                 | (553)              |",

        "page_content": "## Asia insurance operations\n\nThe degree of sensitivity of the results of the non-linked shareholder-backed business of the Asia operations to movements in interest rates depends upon the degree to which the liabilities under the 'grandfathered' IFRS 4 measurement basis reflects market interest rates from year to/uni00A0year. This varies by local business unit. For example:\n\n- -Certain Asia businesses apply US GAAP, for which the results can be more sensitive as the effect of interest rate movements on the backing investments may not be offset by liability movements;\n- -The level of options and guarantees in the products written in the particular business unit will also affect the degree of sensitivity to interest rate movements; and\n- -The degree of sensitivity of the results is dependent on the interest rate level at that point of time.\n\nThe sensitivity of the Asia operations presented as a whole at a given point in time will also be affected by a change in the relative size of the individual businesses.\n\nFor many operations the sensitivities are dominated by the impact of interest rate movements on the value of government and corporate bond/uni00A0investments, which are expected to increase in value as interest rates fall to a greater extent than the offsetting increase in liabilities (and/uni00A0vice versa if rates rise). This arises because the discount rate in some operations does not fluctuate in line with interest rate movements. At/uni00A0higher levels of interest rates the liabilities become less sensitive to interest rate movements and the effects on assets becomes more dominant. This/uni00A0pattern is evident in the 'increase of 1 per cent' sensitivity at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe 'decrease of 0.5%' sensitivities reflects that some local business units' liabilities become more sensitive at lower interest rates and the fluctuations in liabilities begin to exceed asset gains. The liability movements also reflect the prudent nature of some of the regulatory regimes which leads to duration of liabilities that are longer than would be expected on a more economic basis and hence results in a mismatch with the assets that are managed on a more realistic basis. Following the substantial fall in interest rates over 2020, at 31 December 2020, the 'decrease of 0.5 per cent' sensitivity is dominated by the impact of interest rate movements on some local business units' policyholder liabilities, which are expected to increase more than the offsetting increase in the value of government and corporate bond investments, if interest rates were to fall further from the historically low levels seen at 31 December 2020. As noted above, the results only allow for limited management actions, and if such economic conditions persisted management could take additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses, including (but not limited to) rebalancing investment portfolios, increased use of reinsurance, changes to new business pricing and the mix of new business being sold.\n\n## US insurance operations\n\nThe GMWB features attached to variable annuity business (other than 'for life' components) are accounted for under US GAAP at fair value and,/uni00A0therefore, will be sensitive to changes in interest rates. Debt securities and related derivatives are marked to fair value. Value movements on/uni00A0derivatives, net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within the income statement. Fair value movements on/uni00A0debt securities, net of related changes to amortisation of DAC and deferred tax, are recorded within other comprehensive income.\n\nAs at 1 June 2020, the interest rate risks relating to Jackson's fixed and fixed index annuity products have been substantially transferred as/uni00A0part/uni00A0of the reinsurance transaction with Athene described in note D1.1, leaving only a limited exposure from residual policies and new policies written post 1 June 2020. Jackson is exposed primarily to the following interest rate risks:\n\n- -Related to meeting guaranteed rates of accumulation on general account annuity and interest sensitive life products following a sustained fall/uni00A0in interest rates;\n- -Related to increases in the present value of projected benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts following a sustained fall in interest rates especially if in conjunction with a fall in equity markets;\n- -Related to the surrender value guarantee features attached to the Company's general account annuity and interest sensitive life products and/uni00A0to policyholder withdrawals following a sharp and sustained increase in interest rates; and\n- -The risk of mismatch between the expected duration of certain annuity liabilities and prepayment risk and extension risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities.\n\nA prolonged low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of maturities of the general account annuity and interest-sensitive life contract holder liabilities from initial estimates, primarily due to lower policy lapses. As interest rates remain at low levels, Jackson may also have to reinvest the cash it receives as interest or proceeds from investments that have matured or that have been sold at lower yields, reducing its investment margins. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the securities in their investment portfolios with greater frequency in order to/uni00A0borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. The majority of Jackson's general account business was designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be re-set annually, subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees.\n\nThe sensitivity movements provided in the table above are at a point in time and reflect the hedging programme in place on the balance sheet date, while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon a number of factors. Jackson's hedging programme is primarily focused on managing the economic risks in the business and protecting statutory solvency under larger market movements, and does not explicitly aim to hedge the IFRS accounting results. The magnitude of the impact of the sensitivities on profit after tax at 31 December 2020 is/uni00A0larger than the impact at 31 December 2019, reflecting the liabilities being more sensitive to further interest rate movements at the current low/uni00A0interest rate levels (after taking into account the impact of interest rate movements on derivatives). In determining the value of liabilities, assumed future separate account return is based on risk-free rates under 'grandfathered' US GAAP. The reduction in the magnitude of the impact of the sensitivities on other comprehensive income, and hence shareholders' equity, reflects the impact of the Athene reinsurance transaction described in note D1.1 on the profile of Jackson's general account liabilities and the consequential reduction in available-for-sale debt securities.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

If equity markets were to fall by more than 20 per cent, the Group believes that this would not be an instantaneous fall but rather would be expected to occur over a longer period of time, during which the hedge positions within Jackson, where the underlying equity risk is greatest, would be rebalanced. The equity risk sensitivity analysis provided assumes that all equity indices fall by the same percentage.\n\n## Asia insurance operations\n\nThe estimated sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase and 20 per cent decrease in equity and property prices is as follows:\n\n|                                      | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                      | Decrease  of 20%  | Increase  of 10%  | Decrease  of 20%  | Increase  of 10%  |\n| Net effect on shareholders' equity * | (848)             | 410               | (816)             | 408               |\n\nGenerally, changes in equity and property investment values are not directly offset by movements in non-linked policyholder liabilities. Movements in equities backing with-profits and unit-linked business have been excluded as they are generally matched by an equal movement in/uni00A0insurance liabilities (including unallocated surplus of with-profits funds). The impact on changes to future profitability as a result of changes to the asset values within unit-linked or with-profits funds have not been included in the instantaneous sensitivity above. The estimated sensitivities shown above include equity and property investments held by the Group's joint venture and associate businesses.\n\n## US insurance operations\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company provided variable annuity contracts with guarantees, for which the net amount at risk ('NAR') is/uni00A0defined as the amount of guaranteed benefit in excess of current account value, as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n|                                                                                                                               | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2020  $m     | 31 Dec 2019  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                                                               | Account  value    | Net amount  at risk | Account  value    | Net amount  at risk |\n| Return of net deposits plus a minimum return                                                                                  |                   |                     |                   |                     |\n| GMDB                                                                                                                          | 170,510           | 2,340               | 150,576           | 2,477               |\n| GMWB - premium only                                                                                                           | 2,858             | 12                  | 2,753             | 16                  |\n| GMWB                                                                                                                          | 248               | 11                  | 257               | 14                  |\n| GMAB - premium only                                                                                                           | 39                | -                   | 37                | -                   |\n| Highest specified anniversary account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary                                                |                   |                     | -                 | -                   |\n| GMDB                                                                                                                          | 13,512            | 86                  | 12,547            | 69                  |\n| GMWB - highest anniversary only                                                                                               | 3,459             | 41                  | 3,232             | 51                  |\n| GMWB                                                                                                                          | 646               | 55                  | 698               | 52                  |\n| Combination net deposits plus minimum return, highest specified anniversary  account value minus withdrawals post-anniversary |                   |                     | -                 | -                   |\n| GMDB                                                                                                                          | 8,891             | 615                 | 8,159             | 687                 |\n| GMIB                                                                                                                          | 1,675             | 556                 | 1,688             | 616                 |\n| GMWB                                                                                                                          | 159,857           | 5,656               | 140,529           | 7,160               |",

        "page_content": "Jackson is primarily exposed to equity risk through the guarantees included in certain variable annuity benefits. This risk is managed using an/uni00A0equity hedging programme to minimise the risk of a significant economic impact as a result of increases or decreases in equity market levels. Jackson purchases futures and options that hedge the risks inherent in these products, while also considering the impact of rising and falling guaranteed benefit fees.\n\nDue to the nature of valuation under IFRS of the free-standing derivatives and certain of the variable annuity guarantee features, this hedge, while effective on an economic basis, would not automatically offset within the financial statements as the impact of equity market movements resets the free-standing derivatives immediately while the hedged liabilities reset more slowly and fees are recognised prospectively in the year in/uni00A0which they are earned. Jackson's hedging programme is focused on managing the economic risks in the business and protecting statutory solvency in the circumstances of large market movements. The hedging programme does not aim to hedge IFRS accounting results, which can/uni00A0lead to volatility in the IFRS results in a period of significant market movements, as was seen in 2020.\n\nIn addition to the exposure explained above, Jackson is also exposed to equity risk from its holding of equity securities, partnerships in/uni00A0investment pools and other financial derivatives.\n\nThe estimated sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase and 20 per cent decrease in equity and property prices is shown below.\n\n|                                      | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                      | Decrease  of 20%  | Increase  of 10%  | Decrease  of 20%  | Increase  of 10%  |\n| Net effect on shareholders' equity * | 744               | 299               | 762               | 608               |\n\nThe table above excludes the impact of instantaneous equity movements on future separate account fee income.\n\nThe above sensitivities assume instantaneous market movements while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon the/uni00A0volume of new product sales and lapses, changes to the derivative portfolio, correlation of market returns and various other factors including volatility, interest rates and elapsed time.\n\nThe directional movements in the sensitivities reflect the hedging programme in place at 31 December 2020 and 2019 respectively. The nature of Jackson's dynamic hedging programme means that the portfolio, and hence the results of these sensitivities, will change on an ongoing basis. The impacts shown under an increase or a decrease in equity markets reflect the factors discussed above.\n\nJackson had variable annuity contracts with guarantees.

        "page_content": "## C6 Risk and sensitivity analysis continued\n\n## C6.4 Sensitivity to insurance risk\n\n## Asia insurance operations\n\nIn Asia, adverse persistency experience can impact the IFRS profitability of certain types of business written in the region. This risk is managed/uni00A0at/uni00A0a local business unit level through regular monitoring of experience and the implementation of management actions as necessary. These actions could include product enhancements, increased management focus on premium collection, as well as other customer retention efforts. The potential financial impact of lapses is often mitigated through the specific features of the products, eg surrender charges, or through the availability of premium holiday or partial withdrawal policy features. The reserving basis in Asia is generally such that a change in lapse assumptions has an/uni00A0immaterial effect on immediate profitability.\n\nMany of the business units in Asia are exposed to mortality and morbidity risk and a provision is made within policyholder liabilities to cover the potential exposure. If all these assumptions were strengthened by 5 per cent then it is estimated that post-tax profit and shareholders' equity/uni00A0would decrease by approximately $77 million (2019: $77 million). Weakening these assumptions by 5 per cent would have a similar opposite impact.\n\n## US insurance operations\n\nJackson is sensitive to mortality risk, lapse risk and other types of policyholder behaviour, such as the utilisation of its GMWB product features. Jackson's persistency assumptions reflect a combination of recent experience for each relevant line of business and expert judgement, especially where a lack of relevant and credible experience data exists. These assumptions vary by relevant factors, such as product, policy duration, attained age and for variable annuity lapse assumptions, the extent to which guaranteed benefits are 'in the money' relative to policy account values. Changes in these assumptions, which are assessed on an annual basis after considering recent experience, could have a material impact on policyholder liabilities and therefore on profit before tax. Any changes in these assumptions are recorded within short-term fluctuations in investment returns in the Group's supplementary analysis of profit (see note B1.2).\n\nIn addition, in the absence of hedging, equity and interest rate movements can both cause a direct loss or increase the future sensitivity to/uni00A0policyholder behaviour. Jackson has an extensive derivative programme that seeks to manage the exposure to such altered equity markets and/uni00A0interest rates.\n\nNote A3.1 describes the methodology applied by Jackson to amortise DAC. The amount of amortisation charged in any one period is sensitive to separate account investment returns. The sensitivity of DAC amortisation charge is discussed in note C4.2.\n\n## C7 Tax assets and liabilities\n\nAccounting policies on deferred tax are included in note B3.\n\n## C7.1 Current tax\n\nAt 31 December 2020, of the $444 million (31 December 2019: $492 million) current tax recoverable, the majority is expected to be recovered more than 12 months after the reporting period.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the current tax liability of $280 million (31 December 2019: $396 million) includes $113 million (31 December 2019: $198 million) of provisions for uncertain tax matters. Further detail is provided in note B3.2.\n\n## C7.2 Deferred tax\n\nThe statement of financial position contains the following deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to:\n\n|                                                         | 2020  $m          | 2020  $m                       | 2020  $m                                                    | 2020  $m                                                  | 2020  $m           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                         | Balance  at 1 Jan | Movement  in income  statement | Movement  through other  comprehensive   income and  equity | Other  movements  including  foreign  currency  movements | Balance  at 31 Dec |\n| Deferred tax assets                                     |                   |                                |                                                             |                                                           |                    |\n| Unrealised losses or gains on investments               | -                 | -                              | -                                                           | -                                                         | -                  |\n| Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts | 32                | 55                             | -                                                           | -                                                         | 87                 |\n| Short-term temporary differences                        | 3,889             | 765                            | -                                                           | 8                                                         | 4,662              |\n| Unused tax losses                                       | 154               | (50)                           | -                                                           | 5                                                         | 109                |\n| Total                                                   | 4,075             | 770                            | -                                                           | 13                                                        | 4,858              |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                |                   |                                |                                                             |                                                           |                    |\n| Unrealised losses or gains on investments               | (877)             | (78)                           | (102)                                                       | (6)                                                       | (1,063)            |\n| Balances relating to investment and insurance contracts | (1,507)           | (235)                          | -                                                           | (23)                                                      | (1,765)            |\n| Short-term temporary differences                        | (2,853)           | (377)                          | -                                                           | (17)                                                      | (3,247)            |\n| Total                                                   | (5,237)           | (690)                          | (102)                                                       | (46)                                                      | (6,075)            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some of the Group's businesses are located in jurisdictions in which a withholding tax charge is incurred upon the distribution of earnings. At/uni00A031 December 2020, deferred tax liabilities of $323 million (31 December 2019: $247 million) have not been recognised in respect of such withholding taxes as the Group is able to control the timing of the distributions and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in/uni00A0the/uni00A0foreseeable future.\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Amounts recorded in share capital represent the nominal value of the shares issued. The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued, is credited to share premium. Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the/uni00A0consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from retained earnings. Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to retained earnings net of related costs.\n\n|                                           | 2020                        | 2020               | 2020               | 2019                        | 2019               | 2019               |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Issued shares of 5p each fully paid       | Number of  ordinary  shares | Share  capital  $m | Share  premium  $m | Number of  ordinary  shares | Share  capital  $m | Share  premium  $m |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                          | 2,601,159,949               | 172                | 2,625              | 2,593,044,409               | 166                | 2,502              |\n| Shares issued under share-based schemes   | 8,329,753                   | 1                  | 12                 | 8,115,540                   | -                  | 22                 |\n| Impact of change in presentation currency | -                           | -                  | -                  | -                           | 6                  | 101                |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                         | 2,609,489,702               | 173                | 2,637              | 2,601,159,949               | 172                | 2,625              |\n\nOptions outstanding under save as you earn schemes to subscribe for shares at each year end shown below are as follows:\n\n|             | Number                      | Share price range   | Share price range   |                      |\n|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n|             | of shares to  subscribe for | from                | to                  | Exercisable  by year |\n| 31 Dec 2020 | 2,320,320                   | 964p                | 1,455p              | 2026                 |\n| 31 Dec 2019 | 3,805,447                   | 1,104p              | 1,455p              | 2025                 |\n\n## Transactions by Prudential plc and its subsidiaries in Prudential plc shares\n\nThe Group buys and sells Prudential plc shares ('own shares') either in relation to its employee share schemes or, up until the demerger of its UK/uni00A0and Europe operations (M&G plc) in October 2019, via transactions undertaken by authorised investment funds that the Group is deemed to/uni00A0control.

At 31 December 2020, estimated Group shareholder LCSM capital resources is $15.8 billion (31 December 2019: $14.0 billion).\n\n## (ii) External capital requirements\n\nThe Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA) assumed the role of the group-wide supervisor for the Prudential Group following the demerger of/uni00A0M&G plc in October 2019. Ultimately, Prudential plc will become subject to the Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework. The primary legislation was enacted in July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, were tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will also come into operation on 29 March 2021. The/uni00A0GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject/uni00A0to/uni00A0transitional arrangements.\n\nUntil Hong Kong's GWS Framework comes into force, Prudential applies the local capital summation method (LCSM) that has been agreed with the Hong Kong IA to determine Group regulatory capital requirements (both minimum and prescribed levels). The GWS Framework is expected to be largely consistent with that applied under LCSM with the exception of the treatment of debt instruments which will be subject to/uni00A0transitional arrangements under the GWS Framework. Prudential's initial analysis indicates that all debt instruments (senior and subordinated) issued by Prudential will meet the transitional conditions set by the Hong Kong IA and will be included as eligible Group capital resources, although this will be subject to approval by the Hong Kong IA. The LCSM surplus represents the summation of capital resources across local solvency regimes for regulated entities of the Group and IFRS net assets (with some adjustments) for non-regulated entities less the summation of/uni00A0local statutory capital requirements across the Group, with no allowance for diversification between business operations.\n\n## (iii) Meeting of capital management objectives\n\nThe Group minimum capital requirement has been met during 2020.\n\nAs well as holding sufficient capital to meet LCSM requirements at Group level, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds within its/uni00A0central holding companies so that it can:\n\n- -Fund new opportunities;\n- -Maintain flexibility and absorb shock events;\n- -Cover central costs; and\n- -Fund dividends.\n\nMore details on holding company cash flows and balances are given in section I(iii) in the Additional unaudited financial information section. Reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the Asia and US regulators.\n\nThe Group manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities in each business unit. As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory regimes under which it/uni00A0operates, the Group employs differing methods of asset/liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.\n\nThe sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the/uni00A0approach to asset/liability management.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Under C-ROSS, insurers are required to maintain a core solvency ratio (core capital over minimum capital) and a comprehensive solvency ratio (capital resources over minimum capital) of not lower than 50 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively. The review of C-ROSS by the China Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) has resulted in elevating the relevant principles of C-ROSS into regulatory requirements.\n\nThe actual capital is the difference between the admitted assets and admitted liabilities with trading and available-for-sale assets marked-tomarket and other assets at book value. Policyholder liabilities are based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a separate risk margin.\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nThe capital requirements set out in the regulations vary by underlying risk type and duration of liabilities, but are generally determined as/uni00A0a/uni00A0percentage of mathematical reserves and capital at risk.\n\nMathematical reserves are based on a net premium valuation method using assumptions which include a suitable margin for prudence. The/uni00A0valuation interest rate used to value long-term liabilities reflects a blend between the prudent assessment of the portfolio yield and the/uni00A0reinvestment yield subject to a maximum of the prudent portfolio yield. The approach used to determine the reinvestment yield for reserving/uni00A0allows for average yields thus the impact of movements in interest rates are reflected in the valuation interest rate over time. The/uni00A0basis/uni00A0of calculation was updated in 2020 in line with a circular issued by the Hong Kong IA. The capital resources are based on assets that/uni00A0are/uni00A0marked-to-market. The nature of the current regulatory regime means that the duration of statutory liabilities is longer than would be/uni00A0expected on an economic basis and hence there is an inherent mismatch with the assets that are managed on a more realistic basis. The/uni00A0Hong/uni00A0Kong IA is in/uni00A0the/uni00A0process of developing a risk-based capital framework with several quantitative impact studies performed over/uni00A0the/uni00A0past few years, implementation of this framework is targeted by 2024 but the exact timing is uncertain.\n\n## Indonesia\n\nSolvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach. The capital resources are based on assets that are marked-to-market, with/uni00A0policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. Liabilities are zeroised at a policy level (ie negative liabilities are not permitted at a policy level). For unit-linked policies an unearned premium reserve is established.\n\n## Malaysia\n\nA risk-based capital framework applies in Malaysia. The local regulator, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken. Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.\n\nThe capital resources are based on assets that are marked-to-market, with policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. Liabilities are zeroised at a fund level (ie negative liabilities are not permitted at a fund level). The BNM has initiated a review of its RBC framework. An exposure draft on Valuation of Insurance and Takaful Liabilities was issued on 24 December 2019 to gather industry feedback by 15 April 2020. The exact timing of implementation of potential revisions remains uncertain.\n\nMarket liberalisation measures were introduced by BNM in April 2009, which increases the limit from 49 per cent to 70 per cent on foreign equity ownership for insurance companies and Takaful operators in Malaysia. A higher foreign equity limit beyond 70 per cent for insurance companies will be considered by BNM on a case by case basis, for example, for companies who support expansion of providing insurance coverage to the most vulnerable in Malaysian society.\n\n## Singapore\n\nA risk-based capital framework applies in Singapore. The regulator also has the authority to direct that the insurer satisfies additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act if it considers such additional requirements appropriate. The capital resources are based on assets that are marked-to-market, with policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. The updated risk-based capital framework (RBC2) came into effect on 31 March 2020 and this permits the recognition of a prudent allowance for negative reserves in the capital resources.\n\n## (ii) US insurance operations\n\nThe regulatory framework for Jackson is governed by the requirements of the US NAIC-approved Risk-Based Capital standards. Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formula-based capital standard, which includes components calculated by applying after-tax factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and a separate model-based component for market risk and interest rate risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.",

The businesses in Asia may, in general, remit dividends to parent entities, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency requirements and there are sufficient statutory accounting profits. For with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained within the funds, with distribution to shareholders tied to the shareholders' share of declared bonuses.\n\nJackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained. Furthermore, dividends that exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations less net realised investments losses for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jackson's prior/uni00A0year end statutory surplus, excluding any increase arising from the application of permitted practices, require prior regulatory approval.\n\nCapital resources of the non-insurance business units is transferable after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on/uni00A0local regulatory solvency requirements, where relevant.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Property, plant and equipment also includes right-of-use assets for operating leases of properties occupied by the Group and leases of equipment and other tangible assets. All property, plant and equipment, including the right-of-use assets under operating leases, are held at cost less cumulative depreciation, calculated using the/uni00A0straight-line method, and impairment charge.\n\nThe Group does not have any right-of-use assets that would meet the definition of investment property. As at 31 December 2020, total right-of-use assets comprised $429 million (31 December 2019: $569 million) of property and $13 million (31 December 2019: $24 million) of/uni00A0non-property assets. Of the $442 million (31 December 2019: $593 million) total right-of-use assets, $182 million (31 December 2019: $253 million) were held by the Group's with-profits businesses.\n\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option. This assertion is revisited if there is a material change in circumstances. As at 31 December 2020, the undiscounted value of/uni00A0lease payments beyond the break period not recognised in the lease liabilities is $179 million (31 December 2019: $185 million).\n\nA reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Group's property, plant and equipment from the beginning to the end of the years shown is/uni00A0a s/uni00A0f o l l ow s:\n\n|                                                                      | 2020  $m                   | 2020  $m         | 2020  $m              | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m                   | 2019  $m         | 2019  $m              | 2019  $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------|\n|                                                                      | Group  occupied   property | Tangible  assets | Right-of-  use assets | Total      | Group  occupied   property | Tangible  assets | Right-of-  use assets | Total      |\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                                     |                            |                  |                       |            |                            |                  |                       |            |\n| Cost                                                                 | 351                        | 687              | 734                   | 1,772      | 525                        | 2,089            | -

        "page_content": "## D2 Contingencies and related obligations\n\n## Litigation and regulatory matters\n\nThe Group is involved in various litigation and regulatory proceedings. These may from time to time include class actions involving Jackson. While the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group believes that their ultimate outcome will/uni00A0not have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nGuarantee funds in the US and certain markets in Asia provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance/uni00A0companies and are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume and type of business. The estimated reserve for future guarantee fund assessments is not significant. For the majority of the markets in Asia, the insurance company's obligation is limited to the amount paid based on a fixed percentage of premiums. The Directors believe that sufficient provision has been made on the balance sheet for all anticipated payments.\n\nThe Group has provided other guarantees and commitments to third parties entered into in the normal course of business but the Group does/uni00A0not consider that the amounts involved are significant.\n\n## Intra-group capital support arrangements\n\nPrudential has put in place intra-group arrangements to formalise undertakings by Prudential to the regulators of the Hong Kong subsidiaries regarding their solvency levels.\n\n## D3 Post balance sheet events\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe 2020 second interim ordinary dividend approved by the Board of Directors after 31 December 2020 is as described in note B5.\n\n## Intention to demerge the Group's US operations in the second quarter of 2021\n\nIn January 2021, the Board announced that it had decided to pursue the separation of its US operations (Jackson) from the Group through a/uni00A0demerger, whereby shares in Jackson would be distributed to Prudential shareholders.\n\nSubject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, the planned demerger is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021 and would lead to a significantly earlier separation of Jackson from the Group than would have been possible through a minority IPO and future sell-downs, which from market precedent may have lasted until 2023. At the point of demerger, Prudential is planning to retain a 19.9 per cent non-controlling interest in Jackson, which will be reported within the consolidated financial position as a financial investment at fair value. Subject to market conditions, the Group intends to monetise a portion of this investment to support investment in Asia within 12 months of the planned demerger, such that the Group will own less than 10 per cent at the end of such period.\n\nFollowing this decision in January 2021, the US operations (equivalent to the US segment disclosed in these financial statements) are considered to meet the held for distribution criteria in accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0not practicable to quantify the potential financial effect of the planned demerger and the retained non-controlling interest at this stage.\n\n## D4 Related party transactions\n\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe Company has transactions and outstanding balances with collective investment schemes, collateralised debt obligations and similar entities that are not consolidated and where a Group company acts as manager, which are regarded as related parties for the purposes of IAS 24. The balances are included in the Group's statement of financial position at fair value or amortised cost in accordance with IAS 39 classifications with the corresponding amounts included in the income statement. The transactions include amounts paid on issue of shares or units, amounts received on cancellation of/uni00A0shares or units and amounts paid in respect of the periodic charge and administration fee.\n\nIn addition, there are no material transactions between the Group's joint ventures and associates, which are accounted for on an equity method basis, and other Group companies.\n\nKey management personnel of the Company, as described in note B2.3, may from time to time purchase insurance, asset management or annuity products marketed by Group companies in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons.\n\nIn 2020 and 2019, other transactions with key management personnel were not deemed to be significant both by virtue of their size and in the context of the individuals' financial positions. All of these transactions were on terms broadly equivalent to those that prevailed in arm's-length transactions.\n\nAdditional details on the Directors' interests in shares, transactions or arrangements are given in the Directors' remuneration report. Key/uni00A0management remuneration is disclosed in note B2.3.\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## D5 Commitments\n\nThe Group has provided, from time to time, certain guarantees and commitments to third parties.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, Asia operations had $1,913 million unfunded commitments (31 December 2019: $2,013 million) primarily related to investments in infrastructure funds and alternative investment funds. At 31 December 2020, Jackson had unfunded commitments of $831 million (31 December 2019: $889 million) related to investments in limited partnerships and $185 million (31 December 2019: $796 million) related to/uni00A0commercial mortgage loans and other fixed income securities. These commitments were entered into in the normal course of business and/uni00A0a/uni00A0material adverse impact on the operations is not expected to arise from them.\n\n## D6 Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates\n\n## D6.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Group consolidates those investees it is deemed to control. The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: (1)/uni00A0it/uni00A0has power over an investee; (2) it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (3) it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.\n\n## (i) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are those investees that the Group controls. The majority of the Group's subsidiaries are corporate entities, but the Group's insurance operations also invest in a number of limited partnerships.\n\nThe Group performs a re-assessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the Group and/uni00A0an investee. Where the Group is deemed to control an entity it is treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated. Where the Group holds a minority share in an entity, with no control over the entity, the investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## (ii) Joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint control of the net assets of the arrangement. In a number of these arrangements, the Group's share of the underlying net assets may be less than 50 per cent but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and the third party. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but it does not control. Generally it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent voting rights of the entity.\n\nWith the exception of those referred to below, the Group accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates by using the equity method of accounting. The Group's share of profit or loss of its joint ventures and associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of/uni00A0movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The equity method of accounting does not apply to/uni00A0investments in associates and joint ventures held by the Group's insurance or investment funds. This includes venture capital business, mutual funds and unit trusts and which, as allowed by IAS 28, 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures', are carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Structured entities\n\nStructured entities are those that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. Voting rights relate to administrative tasks. Relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The Group invests in/uni00A0structured entities such as:\n\n- -Collective investment schemes;\n- -Limited partnerships;\n- -Variable interest entities;\n- -Investment vehicles within separate accounts offered through variable annuities;\n- -Collateralised debt obligations;\n- -Mortgage-backed securities; and\n- -Similar asset-backed securities.\n\n## Collective investment schemes\n\nThe Group invests in collective investment schemes, which invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties. The/uni00A0Group's percentage ownership in these entities can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors in/uni00A0them.\n\n- -Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50 per cent, the Group is/uni00A0judged to have control over the entity.\n- -Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, the facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the/uni00A0asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity.\n- -Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 20 per cent, the Group is/uni00A0judged to not have control over the entity.\n- -Where the entity is managed by an asset manager outside the Group, an assessment is made of whether the Group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity and therefore control the entity. In assessing the Group's ability to direct an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Where the Group is deemed to control these entities, they are treated as a subsidiary and are consolidated, with the interests of investors other/uni00A0than the Group being classified as liabilities, and appear as net asset value attributable to unit holders of consolidated investment funds.\n\nWhere the Group does not control these entities (as it is deemed to be acting as an agent) and they do not meet the definition of associates, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nWhere the Group's asset manager sets up investment funds as part of asset management operations, the Group's interest is limited to the/uni00A0administration fees charged to manage the assets of such entities. With no participation in these entities, the Group does not retain risks associated with investment funds. For these investment funds, the Group is not deemed to control the entities but to be acting as an agent.\n\nThe Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in investment vehicles commensurate to its participation and does not have any/uni00A0further exposure to the residual risks of these investment vehicles.\n\n## Jackson's separate account assets\n\nThese are investment vehicles that invest contract holders' premiums in equity, fixed income, bonds and money market mutual funds. The/uni00A0contract holder retains the underlying returns and the ownership risks related to the underlying investments. The shareholder's economic interest in separate accounts is limited to the administrative fees charged. The separate accounts are set up as separate regulated entities governed by a Board of Governors or trustees for which the majority of the members are independent of Jackson or any affiliated entity. The/uni00A0independent members are responsible for any decision making that impacts contract holders' interest and govern the operational activities of the entities' advisers, including asset managers. Accordingly, the Group does not control these vehicles. These investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Limited partnerships\n\nThe Group's insurance operations invest in a number of limited partnerships, either directly or through unit trusts, through a mix of capital and/uni00A0loans. These limited partnerships are managed by general partners, in which the Group holds equity. Such interest in general partners and/uni00A0limited partnerships provide the Group with voting and similar rights to participate in the governance framework of the relevant activities in/uni00A0which limited partnerships are engaged in. Accounting for the limited partnerships as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on the terms of each partnership agreement and the shareholdings in the general partners.\n\n## Other structured entities\n\nThe Group holds investments in mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar asset-backed securities, the majority of/uni00A0which are actively traded in a liquid market.\n\nThe Group consolidates the vehicles that hold the investments where the Group is deemed to control the vehicles. When assessing control over the vehicles, the factors considered include the purpose and design of the vehicle, the Group's exposure to the variability of returns and the/uni00A0scope of the Group's ability to direct the relevant activities of the vehicle including any kick-out or removal rights that are held by third parties. The outcome of the control assessment is dependent on the terms and conditions of the respective individual arrangements.\n\nThe majority of such vehicles are not consolidated. In these cases, the Group is not the sponsor of the vehicles in which it holds investments and has no administrative rights over the vehicles' activities. The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks commensurate to its/uni00A0holding and its exposure to the investments and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks or losses of the investments or the/uni00A0vehicles in which it holds investments. Accordingly, the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of such vehicles and all are/uni00A0carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe table below provides aggregate carrying amounts of the investments in unconsolidated structured entities reported in the Group's statement of financial position:\n\n|                                                                         | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2020  $m           | 31 Dec 2020  $m             | 31 Dec 2019  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m           | 31 Dec 2019  $m             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Statement of financial position line items                              | Investment  funds | Separate  account  assets | Other  structured  entities | Investment  funds | Separate  account  assets | Other  structured  entities |\n| Equity securities and holdings in collective  investment/uni00A0schemes | 27,192            | 219,062                   | -                           | 23,622            | 195,070                   | -                           |\n| Debt securities                                                         | -                 | -                         | 3,414                       | -                 | -                         | 6,573                       |\n| Total                                                                   | 27,192            | 219,062                   | 3,414                       | 23,622            | 195,070                   | 6,573                       |\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 and 2019, the Group does not have an agreement, contractual or otherwise, or intention to provide financial support to/uni00A0structured entities that could expose the Group to a loss.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Dividends in excess of these limitations require prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in Asia may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations and has sufficient distributable reserves. For further details on local capital regulations in Asia please refer to note C10.2.\n\n## D6.3 Investments in joint ventures and associates\n\nThe Group has shareholder-backed joint venture insurance and asset management businesses in China with CITIC Group and a joint venture asset management business in India with ICICI Bank. In addition, there is an asset management joint venture in Hong Kong with Bank of China International Holdings Limited (BOCI) and Takaful insurance joint venture in Malaysia.\n\nFor the Group's joint ventures that are accounted for by using the equity method, the net of tax results of these operations are included in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's profit before tax.\n\nThe Group's associates, which are also accounted for under the equity method, include the Indian insurance entity (with the majority shareholder being ICICI Bank). In addition, the Group has investments in collective investment schemes, funds holding collateralised debt obligations, property funds where the Group has significant influence. As allowed under IAS 28, these investments are accounted for on a/uni00A0fair/uni00A0value through profit or loss basis. The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, where there are/uni00A0published price quotations, is approximately $0.7 billion at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $0.7 billion).\n\nFor joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equity method, the 12 months financial information of these investments for the/uni00A0years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 (covering the same period as that of the Group) has been used in these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's share of the profits for shareholder-backed business (including short-term fluctuations in investment returns), net of related tax, in joint ventures and associates, which are equity accounted as shown in the consolidated income statement at 31 December 2020, comprises the following:\n\n| Share of profits from joint ventures and associates, net of related tax   |   2020  $m |   2019  $m |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Asia insurance operations                                                 |        400 |        291 |\n| Asia asset management operations                                          |        117 |        106 |\n| Total segment and Group total                                             |        517 |        397 |\n\nThere is no other comprehensive income in the joint ventures and associates.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the parent company financial statements\n\n## 1 Nature of operations\n\nPrudential plc ('the Company') together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'the Group' or 'Prudential') is an international financial services group. The Group currently has operations in Asia, Africa, the US and the UK. The Group helps individuals to get the most out of life by making healthcare accessible and affordable, helping people accumulate wealth through growing their assets and empowering its customers to save/uni00A0for/uni00A0their goals.\n\n## 2 Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements of the Company, which comprise the statement of financial position, statement of changes in equity and related notes, are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101') and Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements in accordance with IFRS Standards as issued by the IASB and the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own profit and loss account.\n\nIn these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- -A cash flow statement and related notes;\n- -Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Prudential Group;\n- -Disclosure in respect of capital management; and\n- -The effects of new but not yet effective IFRS.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of the Group include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- -IFRS 2 'Share Based Payments' in respect of Group-settled share-based payments;\n- -Disclosure required by IFRS 7 'Financial Instrument Disclosures' and IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement', except for the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 related to IFRS 9 which have not been adopted by the Group; and\n- -IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' in respect of revenue recognition.\n\nThe accounting policies set out in note 3 below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to both years presented in these financial statements.\n\nThe Company and Group manages its cash resources, remittances and financing primarily in US dollars. Accordingly, the functional currency of the Company is US dollars.\n\n## 3 Significant accounting policies\n\n## Investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less impairment. Investments are assessed for impairment by comparing the net assets of the subsidiary undertakings with the carrying value of the investment.\n\n## Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings\n\nAmounts owed by subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions. Provisions are determined using the expected credit loss approach under IFRS 9.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nUnder IFRS 9, except for derivative instruments (where applicable) that are mandatorily classified as fair value through profit or loss, all of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are held at amortised cost. The Company assesses impairment on its loans and receivables using the expected credit loss approach. The expected credit loss on the Company's loans and receivables, the majority of which represent loans to its/uni00A0subsidiaries, have been assessed by taking into account the probability of default on those loans. In all cases, the subsidiaries are expected to have sufficient resources to repay the loan either now or over time based on projected earnings. For loans recallable on demand, the expected credit loss has been limited to the impact of discounting the value of the loan between the balance sheet date and the anticipated recovery date. For loans with a fixed maturity date the expected credit loss has been determined with reference to the historic experience of loans with equivalent credit characteristics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the profit and loss account to the date of maturity or, for subordinated debt, over the expected life of the instrument. Where modifications to borrowings do not result in a substantial difference to the terms of the instrument, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining expected life of the modified instrument. Where modifications to borrowings do result in a substantial difference to the terms of the instrument, the instrument is treated as if it had been extinguished and replaced by a new instrument which is initially recognised at fair value and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. Any costs or fees arising from such a modification are recognised as an expense when incurred.\n\n## Dividends\n\nInterim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.\n\n## Share premium\n\nThe difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions not denominated in the Company's functional currency, US dollars, are initially recorded at the functional rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the Company's functional currency are translated to the Company's functional currency at year end spot rates. The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the profit and loss account for/uni00A0the year.\n\n## Tax\n\nCurrent tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year. To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward indefinitely to be offset, subject to restrictions based on future taxable profits, against profits arising from the same company or other companies in the same UK tax group.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12 'Income Taxes'. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be/uni00A0utilised. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates/uni00A0enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nFollowing the demerger of M&G plc, it is unlikely that the UK tax group will have future taxable income which would enable a current tax credit or deferred tax asset to be recognised.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn ('SAYE') plan for all UK and certain overseas employees. The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled.\n\nUnder IFRS 2 'Share-based payment', where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity. The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions. Cash receipts from business units in respect of/uni00A0newly issued share schemes are treated as returns of capital within investments in subsidiaries.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

In November 2020, the $350 million loan was settled, and the Company entered into a/uni00A0replacement/uni00A0$350 million term loan facility at a cost of daily compounded Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 59 basis points. The new term loan matures in 2024.\n- (iv) These borrowings support a short-term fixed income securities programme.\n\n## 7 Share capital and share premium\n\nA summary of the ordinary shares in issue and the options outstanding to subscribe for the Company's shares at 31 December 2020 is set out in/uni00A0note C8 of the Group IFRS financial statements.\n\n## 8 Retained profit of the Company\n\nRetained profit at 31 December 2020 amounted to $9,476 million (31 December 2019: $10,376 million). The retained profit includes distributable reserves of $3,838 million (31 December 2019: $4,735 million) and non-distributable reserves of $5,638 million (31 December 2019: $5,641 million). The non-distributable reserves of the Company relate to gains on intra-group transactions, in which qualifying consideration was/uni00A0not received, and share-based payment reserves.\n\nUnder UK company law, Prudential may pay dividends only if sufficient distributable reserves of the Company are available for the purpose and if the amount of its net assets is greater than the aggregate of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves (such as the share premium account) and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that aggregate.\n\nThe retained profit of the Company is substantially generated from dividend income received from subsidiaries. The Group segmental analysis illustrates the generation of profit across the Group (see note B1 of the Group IFRS financial statements). The Group and its subsidiaries are subject to local regulatory minimum capital requirements, as set out in note C10 of the Group IFRS financial statements. A number of the principal risks set out in the 'Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's report on the risks facing our business and how these are managed' could/uni00A0impact the generation of profit in the Group's subsidiaries in the future and hence impact their ability to pay dividends in the future.\n\nIn determining the dividend payment in any year, the directors follow the Group dividend policy described in the Group Chief Financial Officer/uni00A0and Chief Operating Officer's report section of this Annual Report. The directors consider the Company's ability to pay current and future/uni00A0dividends twice a year by reference to the Company's business plan and certain stressed scenarios.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

At the point of demerger, Prudential is planning to retain a 19.9 per cent non-controlling interest in Jackson, which will be reported within the consolidated financial position as a financial investment at fair value. Subject to market conditions, the Group intends to monetise a portion of this investment to support investment in Asia within 12 months of the planned demerger, such that the Group will own less than 10 per cent at the end of such period.",

Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our/uni00A0audit/uni00A0opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.\n\nWe were appointed as auditor by the shareholders in October 1999. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 22 financial years ended 31 December 2020. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in/uni00A0accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.

Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of/uni00A0material/uni00A0misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the/uni00A0allocation of/uni00A0resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the/uni00A0engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2019) in decreasing order of audit significance, in/uni00A0arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a/uni00A0separate opinion on these matters.",

The financial statements note C6 disclose the/uni00A0sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our procedures in/uni00A0this area.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n## Methodology choice\n\nWe assessed the methodology for selecting assumptions and calculating the/uni00A0policyholder liabilities. This included:\n\n- -Assessing the methodology adopted for selecting assumptions by applying our/uni00A0industry knowledge and experience and comparing the methodology used/uni00A0against industry standard actuarial practice;\n- -Assessing the methodology adopted for calculating the policyholder liabilities by reference to the requirements of the accounting standard and actuarial market practice, and assessing the impact of current year changes in methodology on the calculation of policyholder liabilities, including the discount rate applied to the valuation of insurance contract liabilities with certain guaranteed withdrawal benefits in the US;\n- -Comparing changes in methodology to our expectations derived from market experience, taking into account the impact of COVID-19 on the observed policyholder experience and the extent to which such impacts are likely to persist; and\n- -Evaluating the analysis of the movements in policyholder liabilities during the/uni00A0year, including consideration of whether the movements were in line with/uni00A0the methodology and assumptions adopted.\n\n## Control operation\n\nWe used our own IT specialists to assist us in performing our procedures in this/uni00A0area/uni00A0which included testing of the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the valuation process. Controls testing in respect of the valuation process included assessment and approval of the methods and assumptions adopted over the calculation of policyholder liabilities as well as appropriate access and change management controls over the actuarial models.\n\nn",

For/uni00A0these/uni00A0positions a reliable third-party price was not/uni00A0readily available and therefore involved the application/uni00A0of expert judgement in the valuations adopted.\n\nAuditor judgement is required to assess whether the directors' overall estimate, based on their judgement depending on the observability and significance of the inputs into the valuation and the consequent impact on/uni00A0the classification of those investments, falls within an/uni00A0acceptable range, and further judgement is required in/uni00A0determining the appropriate valuation methodology where external pricing sources are either not readily available or are unreliable.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of certain level 2 and 3 investments held at fair value has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of/uni00A0reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole and possibly many times that amount.\n\nThe financial statements note C6 disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\nWe used our own valuation specialists in order to assist us in performing our/uni00A0procedures in this area.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n## Methodology choice\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the pricing methodologies with reference to/uni00A0relevant accounting standards as well as industry practice.\n\n## Control operation\n\nWe tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the valuation process, including the Group's review and approval of the estimates and assumptions used for the valuation including key authorisation and/uni00A0data input controls.\n\n## Tests of details\n\nFor a sample of securities, we used our valuation specialists to assess the Group's classification of assets within Level 2 or Level 3 by evaluating the observability of/uni00A0the inputs used in valuing these securities.\n\nFor a sample of unlisted debt securities we compared the price adopted to our independently derived price, using our valuation specialists.\n\nFor a sample of unlisted equity securities, we agreed the valuations for the NAV funds to the most recent NAV statements. To assess reliability of these statements we compared to audited financial statements of the funds, where available, or performed a retrospective test over the NAV valuations for each fund to assess if the fund valuations reported in the audited financial statements in the prior year were materially consistent with the most recent NAV valuation statements available at the time.\n\n## Assessing transparency\n\nWe assessed whether the disclosures in relation to the valuation of level 2 and 3 investments held at fair value are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements.\n\n## Our result\n\nWe found the valuation of level 2 and 3 investments held at fair value to be acceptable (2019: acceptable).\n\nn",

The risk compared to the prior year has increased\n\nRefer to page 150 (Audit Committee report), page 219 (accounting policy) and pages 271 to 273 (financial disclosures)\n\nThe risk\n\nOur response\n\nDAC represents 3 per cent (2019: 3 per cent) of the Group's total assets. The DAC associated with the US component, which represents 85 per cent (2019: 86 per cent) of the total DAC, involves the greatest judgement in terms of measurement.\n\n## Subjective valuation\n\nUS DAC related to annuities is amortised in proportion to/uni00A0estimated gross profits. Auditor judgement is required to assess whether the directors' overall estimate, taking into account key assumptions impacting estimated gross profits, which include assumptions such as benefit utilisation, mortality and persistency as well as the assumptions around long-term investment return and/uni00A0future hedge costs, falls within an acceptable range. We/uni00A0consider the risk to have increased in the current year due to the business and economic disruption caused by the Coronavirus pandemic and its impact on policyholder experience, and the prolonged low interest rate environment.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the amortisation of US DAC has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole. The financial statements note C6 discloses the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our audit procedures in this area.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n## Historical comparison\n\nAssumptions relating to benefit utilisation, persistency and mortality are also relevant to the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities. See further detail in/uni00A0our response to that risk.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions used in determining the estimated future profit profile and the extent of the associated adjustment necessary to the amortisation of the US DAC asset. Our work included critically assessing the judgements that determine the future profit profiles in the context of/uni00A0actual historical experience as well as by reference to market trends.\n\n## Our sector experience\n\nWe challenged the reasonableness of the selected assumptions relating to projected investment return and future hedge costs based on our understanding of/uni00A0developments in the business and the impact of COVID-19 related uncertainty on market performance and volatility. Our work included comparing the projected investment returns against the investment portfolio mix and market return data. Additionally, we evaluated management's modelling approach for deriving the assumption for future hedge costs by reference to actuarial market practice, trends in the historical profile of hedge costs, and our expectations regarding the likely development of interest rates and the associated impact on the hedge costs.\n\n## Tests of details\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the extent of amortisation adjustment in the current period by recalculating the estimated gross profits for a selection of individual policies by reference to the future profiles.\n\n## Assessing transparency\n\nWe assessed whether the disclosures in relation to the amortisation of US DAC are/uni00A0compliant with the relevant accounting requirements.\n\n## Our result\n\nWe found the amortisation of US DAC to be acceptable (2019: acceptable).\n\n## Recoverability of parent company's investment in subsidiaries - (2020: $12,682 million, 2019: $10,444 million) The risk compared to the prior year is unchanged.

Their recoverability is not at/uni00A0a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to their materiality in/uni00A0the context of the parent company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n## Tests of details\n\nComparing the carrying amount of 100% of the investments in subsidiaries with the/uni00A0relevant subsidiaries' draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.\n\n## Assessing subsidiary audits\n\nAssessing the work performed by the subsidiary audit teams on all of those subsidiaries and considering the results of that work on those subsidiaries' profits and net assets.\n\n## Our result\n\nWe found the Group's assessment of the recoverability of the investment in/uni00A0subsidiaries to be acceptable (2019: acceptable).",

We consider IFRS shareholders' equity to be the most appropriate benchmark as it represents the residual interest that can be ascribed to shareholders after policyholder assets and corresponding liabilities have been accounted for; we consider that this is the most appropriate measure for the size of/uni00A0the business and that it provides a stable measure year on year. We/uni00A0compared our materiality against other relevant benchmarks (total/uni00A0assets, total revenue and profit before tax) to ensure the materiality selected was appropriate for our audit. We set out below/uni00A0the materiality thresholds that are key to the audit.\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was/uni00A0set at $60 million (2019: $40 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of parent company's net assets, of which it represents 0.5 per cent (2019: 0.3 per cent). The component materiality, as determined by the Group audit team, applied to the audit of the parent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompany financial statements as a whole is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to its net assets.\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that detected and undetected immaterial misstatements in individual account balances aggregate up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality for both the group and parent company was/uni00A0set at 75% (2019: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as/uni00A0a whole, which equates to $187 million (2019: $223 million) and/uni00A0$45 million (2019: $30 million), respectively. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Group audit committee any corrected or/uni00A0uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $12.5 million (2019:/uni00A0$15 million) in addition to other identified misstatements that/uni00A0warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Group Materiality\n\n$250m (2019: $298m)\n\n## $250m\n\nWhole financial statements materiality (2019: $298m)\n\n## $187m\n\nWhole financial statements performance materiality (2019: $223m)\n\n## $120m\n\nRange of materiality at 13 components ($13m-$120m) (2019: $55m to $115m)\n\n## $12.5m\n\nMisstatements reported to the audit committee (2019: $15m)\n\nWe subjected the Group's operations to audits for group reporting purposes as follows:\n\nOf the 14 (2019:14) reporting components scoped in for the Group audit, we subjected 8 (2019: 10) to full scope audits for group reporting purposes, 4 (2019: 4) to an audit of account balances, 1 (2019: nil) to specified risk-focused audit procedures over cash and debt securities and 1 (2019: nil) to specified risk-focused audit procedures over operational and other borrowings. The components for which we performed work other than full scope audits for group reporting purposes were not individually significant but were included in the scope of our group reporting work as they did present specific individual audit risks that needed to be addressed or in order to provide further coverage over the Group's results.\n\nThe components subjected to full scope audits consisted of the parent/uni00A0company and the insurance operations in the US, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and mainland China.\n\nThe components subjected to an audit of account balances included the insurance operations in Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, and/uni00A0the fund management operations of Eastspring Singapore. The account balances audited for Thailand were policyholder liabilities, investments, deferred acquisition costs, intangible assets, premiums and claims; the account balances audited for Taiwan were policyholder liabilities, investments, and deferred acquisition costs, premiums and claims; the account balances audited for Eastspring Singapore were other income and expenses the account balances audited for the Philippines were policyholder liabilities and investments. The components for which we performed specified audit risk-focused procedures over cash and debt securities as well as operational and other borrowings were the Group's treasury operations as well as the US collateralised loan obligation operations, respectively.\n\nFor the remaining operations, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these operations.\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to/uni00A0be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported. The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from $13 million to $120 million (2019: $40 million to $238 million) across the components, having regard to the size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on 12 components (2019: 13 components) was performed by component auditors and work on the remaining two components, which included the parent company, was performed by the Group audit team.\n\nWhilst it would be conventional practice to visit component teams, the/uni00A0impact of the Coronavirus restrictions on travel has required an/uni00A0alternative approach this year, which required more extensive use/uni00A0of video and telephone conference meetings with all component auditors.

We have nothing to report on going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Company or the Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Company's and the Group's financial position means that this is/uni00A0realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to/uni00A0continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group and Company, its industry, and/uni00A0the general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- -Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic environment which affect the valuations of the Group's investments, wider credit spreads and defaults and valuation of policyholder liabilities due to the impact of these market movements;\n- -The impact on regulatory capital solvency margins from movements in interest rates; and\n- -Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as failure of some of the Group's counterparties (such as banks and reinsurers) to meet commitments, which could give rise to a negative impact on the Group's financial position and liquidity, and wider economic factors such as the Coronavirus pandemic's impact on/uni00A0economic volatility and market uncertainty in the period, and other such macroeconomic events.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or solvency in the going concern period by assessing the Directors' sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by/uni00A0the Group's and Company's cash flow forecasts taking account of/uni00A0severe but plausible adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively.\n\nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in note A1 to the/uni00A0financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- -we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of/uni00A0accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is/uni00A0appropriate;\n- -we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- -we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in note A1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note A1 to be acceptable; and\n- -the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 168 is/uni00A0materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit/uni00A0knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict future events or conditions and as/uni00A0subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with/uni00A0judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the/uni00A0above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group and the Company will continue in operation.\n\n## 5.  Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due/uni00A0to/uni00A0f r aud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- -Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit, group security, and inspecting key papers provided to those charged with/uni00A0governance as to the high-level policies and procedures to/uni00A0prevent and detect fraud, including the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing' and process for engaging local management to/uni00A0identify fraud risks specific to their business units, as well as/uni00A0whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected, or/uni00A0a lleged/uni00A0fraud.\n- -Reading board and audit committee minutes.\n- -Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for directors.\n- -Consulted with professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in/uni00A0identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group and Company.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group team to all component audit teams in scope of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and requests to these audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at/uni00A0group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the/uni00A0risks of management override of controls, in particular the risk that/uni00A0group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements. Accordingly, we identified fraud risks related to both the valuation of insurance contract liabilities and US DAC amortisation. This reflects their direct impact on the Group's profit, the opportunity for management to manipulate assumptions due to the subjectivity involved and given the long-term nature of these assumptions which are more difficult to corroborate, and potential incentives for the group to manipulate the profitability of both/uni00A0the US and Asia businesses given the planned separation of the US business taking into account the potential for any management bias/uni00A0in determining the results for the US business.\n\nOn this audit we do not consider there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition as there is limited management judgement involved in the determination of all material revenue streams as the amounts are contractually derived.\n\nIn determining the audit procedures to address the identified fraud risks, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the group-wide anti-fraud risk controls. In order to address the risk of fraud specifically as it relates to the valuation of insurance contract liabilities and amortisation of US DAC, we involved actuarial specialists to assist in our challenge of management.

Further detail in respect of these is/uni00A0set/uni00A0out in the audit response to the risks associated with these two/uni00A0key/uni00A0audit matters in section 2 of this report.\n\nTo address the pervasive risk as it relates to management override, we/uni00A0also performed procedures including:\n\n- -Identifying journal entries to test for all in-scope components, other than those only in scope for specified risk-based audit procedures, based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These include unusual journal entries posted to either cash or borrowings.\n- -Evaluating the business purpose of non-recurring transactions.\n- -Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\nWe discussed with the audit committee matters related to actual or suspected fraud, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due/uni00A0to/uni00A0non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be/uni00A0expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors, and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence. We discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with/uni00A0laws and regulation.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an/uni00A0understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to/uni00A0all in-scope component audit teams, with the exception of those scoped in only for specified risk-based audit procedures, of relevant laws and regulations identified at the group level, and a request for these teams to report to the group any instances of non-compliance with said laws and regulations, or any identified local laws and regulations, that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect/uni00A0the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the area of regulatory capital as that most likely to have such an effect recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore,\n\nif/uni00A0a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\nWe discussed with the audit committee matters related to actual or/uni00A0suspected to breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is/uni00A0not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of/uni00A0law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in/uni00A0the/uni00A0financial statements, even though we have properly planned and/uni00A0performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For/uni00A0example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of nondetection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 6.  We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the/uni00A0information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- -we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report;\n- -in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- -in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be/uni00A0audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is/uni00A0a/uni00A0material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and/uni00A0the financial statements and our audit knowledge. Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in/uni00A0relation to:\n\n- -The directors' confirmation within the viability statement on page 68, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and/uni00A0liquidity;",

As we/uni00A0cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a/uni00A0material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our/uni00A0audit knowledge:\n\n- -the directors' statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- -the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit/uni00A0Committee, including the significant issues that the audit committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and/uni00A0how those issues were addressed; and\n- -the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of the/uni00A0effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of/uni00A0the/uni00A0UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to report in this respect.\n\n## 7.  We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in/uni00A0our opinion:\n\n- -Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- -The parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- -Certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are/uni00A0not made; or\n- -We have not received all the information and explanations we/uni00A0require for our audit.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n## 8.  Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 309, the/uni00A0directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. They are also responsible for: such internal control as they determine is/uni00A0necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are/uni00A0free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 9.  The purpose of our audit work and to whom we/uni00A0owe/uni00A0our/uni00A0responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in/uni00A0accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in/uni00A0an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for/uni00A0our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philip Smart (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nFor and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nPublic Interest Entity Auditor recognised in accordance with/uni00A0the/uni00A0Hong/uni00A0Kong Financial Reporting Council Ordinance\n\nChartered Accountants London\n\n2 March 2021",

All results are stated net of tax and converted using actual exchange rates (AER) unless otherwise stated. AER are actual historical exchange rates/uni00A0for the relevant accounting period. Constant exchange rate (CER) results are calculated by translating prior year results using current period foreign currency exchange rates, ie current period average rates for the income statements and current period closing rate for the balance sheet. Where appropriate, the EEV basis results include the effects of adoption of IFRS Standards.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the preparation of the supplementary information in accordance with the EEV Principles. In preparing the EEV/uni00A0basis supplementary information, the Directors have satisfied themselves that the Group remains a going concern. Further information is/uni00A0provided in note A1 of the IFRS financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## European Embedded Value (EEV) basis results\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nIn broad terms, IFRS profit for long-term business reflects the aggregate of results on a traditional accounting basis. By contrast, EEV is a way/uni00A0of/uni00A0measuring the value of the in-force life insurance business. The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value. The/uni00A0EEV/uni00A0Principles provide consistent definitions of the components of EEV, a framework for setting assumptions and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures. Results prepared under the EEV Principles represent the present value of the shareholders' interest in/uni00A0the post-tax future profits (on a local statutory basis) expected to arise from the current book of long-term business, after sufficient allowance has been made for the aggregate risks in the business. The shareholders' interest in the Group's long-term business is the sum of the shareholders' total net worth and the value of in-force business.\n\nFor the purposes of preparing EEV basis results, insurance joint ventures and associates are included at the Group's proportionate share of/uni00A0their embedded value and not at their market value. Asset management and other non-insurance subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the EEV basis results at the Group's proportionate share of IFRS basis shareholders' equity, with central Group debt shown on/uni00A0a/uni00A0market value basis.\n\nKey features of the Group's EEV methodology include:\n\n- -Economic assumptions . The projected post-tax profits assume a level of future investment return and are discounted using a risk discount rate./uni00A0Both the risk discount rate and the investment return assumptions are updated at each valuation date to reflect current market risk-free rates, such that changes in market risk-free rates impact all projected future cash flows. Risk-free rates, and hence investment return assumptions, are based on observable market data, with current market risk-free rates assumed to remain constant throughout the projection, with no trending or mean reversion to longer-term assumptions. Different products will be sensitive to different assumptions, for example, spread-based products or products with guarantees are likely to benefit disproportionately from higher assumed investment returns.\n- -Time value of financial options and guarantees . Explicit quantified allowances are made for the time value of financial options and guarantees (TVOG). The TVOG is determined by weighting the probability of outcomes across a large number of different economic scenarios, centred around current historically low risk-free interest rates, and is typically less applicable to health and protection business that generally contains more limited financial options or guarantees.\n- -Allowance for risk in the risk discount rates . Risk discount rates are set equal to the risk-free rate at the valuation date plus product-specific allowances for market and non-market risks. Risks that are explicitly captured elsewhere, such as via the TVOG, are not included in the risk discount rates. The allowance for market risk is based on a product-by-product assessment of the sensitivity of shareholder cash flows to varying market returns. Products with greater market exposure will have an appropriately higher risk discount rate, for example savings and/uni00A0unit-linked products will typically have a higher allowance for market risk compared to health and protection products due to the higher/uni00A0proportion of equity-type assets in the investment portfolio. Other product design and business features also affect the sensitivity of/uni00A0shareholder cash flows to market returns. For example, the construct of UK-style with-profits funds in some business units reduce the sensitivity of both policyholder and shareholder cash flows for participating products, and products where shareholder cash flows are based on a fixed charging structure (rather than charges that are sensitive to investment performance) typically attract a lower allowance for market risk. The allowance for non-market risk comprises a base Group-wide allowance of 50 basis points plus additional allowances for emerging market risk where appropriate. At 31 December 2020 the total allowance for non-market risk in Asia is equivalent to a $(3.2) billion reduction, or around (7) per cent of the Asia embedded value.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

Where appropriate, adjustments are made to total net worth so that backing assets are included at market value, rather than at cost, to comply with the EEV Principles. In the Group's Asia and US operations, assets deemed to be inadmissible on/uni00A0a/uni00A0local regulatory basis are generally included in net worth, with the exception of deferred tax assets in the US that are inadmissible under the/uni00A0local regulatory basis, which have been included in the value of in-force business (VIF) within the Group's EEV results.\n\nFree surplus for asset management and other non-insurance operations (including the Group's central operations and Africa operations) is/uni00A0taken to be IFRS basis shareholders' equity, net of goodwill attributable to equity holders, with central Group debt shown on a market value basis and subordinated debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it is classified as available capital under the Group's capital regime. A/uni00A0reconciliation of EEV free surplus to the Group's Local Capital Summation Method (LCSM) surplus over Group minimum capital requirements is/uni00A0set out in note I(i) of the additional financial information.\n\n|                                                                                                                                        | 2020  $m 2019   | 2020  $m 2019   | 2020  $m 2019                          | 2020  $m 2019   | 2020  $m 2019   | $m           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                                                                        | Asia            | US              | Total  insurance and asset  management | Other  note 5   | Group  total    | Group  total |\n| Expected transfer from in-force business                                                                                               | 1,878           | 1,114           | 2,992                                  |                 | 2,992           | 3,081        |\n| Expected return on existing free surplus                                                                                               | 101             | 25              | 126                                    |                 | 126             | 141          |\n| Changes in operating assumptions and experience variances                                                                              | 222             | 156             | 378                                    |                 | 378             | 558          |\n| Operating free surplus generated from in-force long-term business  note (i)                                                            | 2,201           | 1,295           | 3,496                                  |                 | 3,496           | 3,780        |\n| Investment in new business  note (ii)                                                                                                  | (559)           | (192)           | (751)                                  |                 | (751)           | (1,158)      |\n| Long-term business                                                                                                                     | 1,642           | 1,103           | 2,745                                  |                 | 2,745           | 2,622        |\n| Asset management                                                                                                                       | 253             | 6               | 259                                    |                 | 259             | 275          |\n| Operating free surplus generated from long-term and asset  management businesses                                                       | 1,895           | 1,109           | 3,004                                  |                 | 3,004           | 2,897        |\n|                                                                                                                                        |                 |                 | -

Non-operating free surplus generated for other operations represents the post-tax IFRS basis short-term fluctuations in investment returns for other entities, as shown in Note B1.2 of the IFRS/uni00A0Financial Statements, along with mark-to-market value movements on core structural borrowings (unless classified as available capital under the Group's capital regime).\n- (iv) Net cash flows to parent company for Asia operations reflect the flows as included in the holding company cash flow at transaction rates. The difference to the intra-group dividends and investment in operations in the movement in EEV shareholders' equity primarily relates to intra-group loans, foreign exchange and other non-cash items.",

The main driver for changes in the risk discount rates from year/uni00A0to/uni00A0year is changes in the risk-free rates, the impact of which is expected to be broadly offset by a corresponding change in assumed investment returns, the effect of which is not included in these sensitivities. The impact of higher investment returns can be approximated as/uni00A0the difference between the sensitivity to increases in interest rates and the sensitivity to increases in risk discount rates; and\n- -The Group minimum capital requirements under the LCSM in contrast to EEV basis required capital (embedded value only).\n\nThe sensitivities shown below are for the impact of instantaneous and permanent changes (with no trending or mean reversion) on the embedded value of long-term business operations and include the combined effect on the value of in-force business and net assets (including derivatives) held at the valuation dates indicated. The sensitivities reflect the consequential impacts from market movements at the valuation date. The results only allow for limited management actions such as changes to future policyholder bonuses where applicable. If such economic conditions persisted, the financial impacts may differ to the instantaneous impacts shown below. In this case management could also take additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses. No change in the assets held at the valuation date is assumed when calculating sensitivities. The sensitivity impacts are expected to be non-linear, to aid understanding of this non linearity, impacts of both a 1% and 2% increase to interest rates and risk discount rates are shown.\n\nIf the changes in assumptions shown in the sensitivities were to occur, the effects shown below would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following year, namely the effect of changes in economic assumptions and short-term fluctuations in investment returns. In addition, for changes in interest rates, the effect shown below for the US (Jackson) would also be recorded within mark-to-market value movements on Jackson assets backing surplus and required capital, which are taken directly to shareholders' equity. In addition to the sensitivity effects shown below, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for/uni00A0example new business profit and expected return on existing business, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.\n\n## New business profit from long-term business\n\n|                                                          | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m    | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n|                                                          | Asia       | US         | Group total | Asia       | US         | Group total |\n| New business profit                                      | 2,201      | 601        | 2,802       | 3,522      | 883        | 4,405       |\n| Interest rates and consequential effects - 2% increase   | 107        | 669        | 776         | n/a        | n/a        | n/a         |\n| Interest rates and consequential effects - 1% increase   | 78         | 375        | 453         | (46)       | 207        | 161         |\n| Interest rates and consequential effects - 0.5% decrease | (98)       | (149)      | (247)       | (121)      | (123)      | (244)       |\n| Equity/property yields - 1% rise                         | 140        | 88         | 228         | 210        | 70         | 280         |\n| Risk discount rates - 2% increase                        | (626)      | 112        | (514)       | n/a        | n/a        | n/a         |\n| Risk discount rates - 1% increase                        | (372)      | 33         | (339)       | (715)      | (22)       | (737)       |\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

These interest rate sensitivities illustrate the impact of using different economic assumptions within our EEV framework. For a 1 per cent increase in assumed interest rates the $(1,429) million negative effect comprises a $(5,286) million negative impact of increasing the risk discount rate by 1 per cent, partially offset by a $3,857 million benefit from assuming 1 per cent higher investment returns. Similarly, for a/uni00A02 per cent increase in assumed interest rates the $(3,589) million negative effect comprises a $(9,225) million negative impact of increasing the risk discount rates by 2 per cent, partially offset by a $5,636 million benefit from higher assumed investment returns. Finally, for a 0.5 per cent decrease in assumed interest rates there would be a $177 million positive effect from the 0.5 per cent reduction in assumed discount rates being/uni00A0partially offset by lower assumed investment returns. For a 1 per cent increase in the assumed Asia equity risk premium and property risk/uni00A0premium the EEV would increase by $1,949 million.\n\nIn order to illustrate the impact on EEV of varying specific economic assumptions, all other assumptions are held constant in the sensitivities above, and therefore the actual changes in EEV were these economic effects to materialise may differ from the sensitivities shown. For example, if/uni00A0interest rates decreased by 0.5 per cent, as well as changes to the risk free rate, market risk allowances would likely also be increased within the/uni00A0risk discount rate, leading to a larger increase in the risk discount rate than 0.5 per cent, and a larger reduction in EEV of $(1,264) million (compared to the $177 million benefit shown above from reducing both the earned rate and discount rate by 0.5 per cent). However, if interest rates actually increased by 1 per cent the likely change in EEV would not materially differ to the impact of the 1 per cent interest rate sensitivity shown above.\n\n## US insurance operations\n\nThe interest rate and equity/property market values sensitivity movements provided in the table above are at a point in time and reflect the hedging programme in place on the valuation date, while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon a number of factors. The sensitivity of the US long-term business embedded value to interest rates is driven by the change in assumed investment returns, and the consequential impact on future fee income and projected benefit and dynamic hedging costs, offset by the impact of market value movements on derivatives and other assets. At the lower interest rates at 31 December 2020, the positive impact from higher assumed investment returns from a/uni00A01 per cent increase in/uni00A0risk-free rates is higher than at 31 December 2019. For a 0.5 per cent decrease in interest rates the increase in expected benefit costs is offset by the hedging protection held to manage such a risk to a greater extent than in 2019.\n\nThe equity/property market values sensitivity is driven by a negative effect from lower future fee income and increased projected benefit and dynamic hedging costs on variable annuity business, partially offset by market value movements on equity derivatives held at the valuation date.",

It includes interest costs on core structural borrowings, corporate expenditure for head office/uni00A0functions in/uni00A0London and Hong Kong that is not recharged/allocated to the insurance operations, and Africa operations.\n\nIn line with the EEV Principles, the allowance for the future cost of internal asset management services within the EEV basis results for long-term insurance operations excludes the projected future profits or losses generated by any non-insurance entities within the Prudential Group in providing those services (ie the EEV for long-term insurance operations assumes that the cost of internal asset management services will be that incurred by the Group as a whole, not the cost that will be borne by the insurance business). The results of the Group's asset management operations include the current period profit from the management of both internal and external funds, consistent with their presentation within the Group's IFRS basis reporting. An adjustment is accordingly made to Group EEV operating profit, within the EEV basis results for other operations, to deduct the expected profit anticipated to arise in the current period in the opening VIF from internal asset management services, such that Group EEV operating profit includes the actual profit earned in respect of the management of these assets.\n\nAny costs incurred within the head office functions in London and Hong Kong that are attributable to the long-term insurance (covered) business are recharged/allocated to the insurance operations and recorded within the results for those operations. The assumed future expenses within the value of in-force business for long-term insurance operations allow for amounts expected to be recharged/allocated by the head office functions. Other costs that are not recharged/allocated to the insurance operations are shown as part of other income and expenditure for the current year, and are not included within the projection of future expenses for in-force insurance business.\n\n|                                                                                                     | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| IFRS basis other income and expenditure *                                                           | (748)      | (926)      |\n| Tax effects on IFRS basis results                                                                   | (17)       | 82         |\n| Less: unwind of expected profit on internal management of the assets of the Asia long-term business | (68)       | (56)       |\n| Less: unwind of expected profit on internal management of the assets of the US long-term business   | (25)       | (23)       |\n| EEV basis other income and expenditure                                                              | (858)      | (923)      |\n\nThe EEV basis shareholders' equity for other operations is taken to be IFRS basis shareholders' equity, with central Group debt shown on a market value basis.

        "page_content": "## 8 Methodology and accounting presentation\n\n## (i) Methodology\n\n## (a) Covered business\n\nThe EEV basis results for the Group are prepared for 'covered business' as defined by the EEV Principles. Covered business represents the Group's long-term insurance business (including the Group's investments in joint venture and associate insurance operations), for which the value of new and in-force contracts is attributable to shareholders.\n\nThe EEV basis results for the Group's covered business are then combined with the post-tax IFRS basis results of the Group's asset management and other operations (including interest costs on core structural borrowings, corporate expenditure for head office functions in London and Hong Kong that is not recharged/allocated to the insurance operations, and Africa operations), with an adjustment to deduct the unwind of expected margins on the internal management of the assets of the covered business. Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management, as described in note (g) below.\n\nThe definition of long-term insurance business comprises those contracts falling under the definition for regulatory purposes together with, for US operations, contracts that are in substance the same as guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) but do not fall under the technical definition.\n\n## (b) Valuation of in-force and new business\n\nThe EEV basis results are prepared incorporating best estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses, as described in note 9(iii). These assumptions are used to project future cash flows. The/uni00A0present value of the projected future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate, as shown in note 9(i), which reflects both the time value of money and all other non-diversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.\n\nThe total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated under the EEV basis is the same as that calculated under the IFRS basis. Since the EEV basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under the EEV methodology the profit emergence is advanced, thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profit with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to/uni00A0business sold during the year.\n\n## New business\n\nIn determining the EEV basis value of new business, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing regular/uni00A0and single premium business as set out in the Group's new business sales reporting.\n\nNew business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to the covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment contracts under IFRS 4. New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.\n\nNew business profit represents profit determined by applying operating and economic assumptions as at the end of the year. New business profitability is a key metric for the Group's management of the development of the business. In addition, new business margins are shown by reference to annual premium equivalent (APE) and the present value of new business premiums (PVNBP). These margins are calculated as the percentage of the value of new business profit to APE and PVNBP. APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular premiums on new business written in the period and one-tenth of single premiums. PVNBP is calculated as the aggregate of single premiums and the present value of expected future premiums from regular premium new business, allowing for lapses and the other assumptions made in determining the EEV new/uni00A0business profit.\n\n## Valuation movements on investments\n\nWith the exception of debt securities held by Jackson, investment gains and losses during the year (to the extent that changes in capital values do/uni00A0not directly match changes in liabilities) are included directly in the profit for the year and shareholders' equity as they arise.\n\nThe results for the covered business conceptually reflect the aggregate of the post-tax IFRS basis results and the movements in the additional shareholders' interest recognised on an EEV basis. Therefore, the start point for the calculation of the EEV basis results for Jackson, as for other businesses, reflects the market value movements recognised on an IFRS basis.\n\nIn determining the movements in the additional shareholders' interest, for Jackson's debt securities backing liabilities, the aggregate EEV basis/uni00A0results reflect the fact that the value of in-force business incorporates the discounted value of expected future spread earnings. This value is/uni00A0generally not affected by short-term market movements in debt securities that, broadly speaking, are held for the longer term. Consequently, within EEV total net worth, Jackson's debt securities backing liabilities are held on a statutory basis (largely at book value), while those backing surplus and required capital are accounted for at market value. Consistent with the treatment applied under IFRS 4, for Jackson's debt securities classified as available-for-sale, movements in unrealised appreciation and depreciation on these securities are accounted for directly in equity rather than in the income statement, as shown in 'Mark-to-market value movements on Jackson assets backing surplus and required capital' in/uni00A0the statement of movement in Group EEV shareholders' equity.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## 8 Methodology and accounting presentation continued\n\n## (i) Methodology continued\n\n## (c) Cost of capital\n\nA charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of locked-in required capital supporting the Group's long-term business. The/uni00A0cost/uni00A0is/uni00A0the difference between the nominal value of the capital held and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital, allowing/uni00A0for post-tax investment earnings on the capital.\n\nThe EEV results are affected by the movement in this cost from year to year, which comprises a charge against new business profit and/uni00A0generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.\n\nWhere required capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets within the fund is already adjusted to/uni00A0reflect its expected release over time and so no further adjustment to the shareholder position is necessary.\n\n## (d) Financial options and guarantees\n\n## Nature of financial options and guarantees in Prudential's long-term business\n\n## Asia\n\nParticipating products in Asia, principally written in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. These products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed. There are two types of bonuses: regular and final. Regular bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular products. Final/uni00A0bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.\n\nThere are also various non-participating long-term products with guarantees. The principal guarantees are those for whole-of-life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that typically accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions. Similar to participating products, the policyholder charges incorporate an allowance for the cost of providing these guarantees. During 2020 the/uni00A0approach to determining these charges was reviewed and simplified for certain whole-of-life products in Hong Kong; the charges will now/uni00A0remain constant throughout varying economic conditions, rather than reducing as the economic environment improves and vice versa.\n\n## US\n\nJackson issues variable annuity contracts for which it contractually guarantees to the contract holder, subject to specific conditions, either: a)/uni00A0a/uni00A0return of no less than total deposits made to the contract, adjusted for any partial withdrawals; b) total deposits made to the contract, adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return; or c) the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date, adjusted for any withdrawals following the specified contract anniversary. These guarantees include benefits that are payable upon depletion of funds (Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWB)) or as death benefits (Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (GMDB)). These guarantees generally protect the policyholder's contract value in the event of poor equity market performance. Jackson hedges the GMWB and GMDB guarantees through the use of hedge contracts, with an expected long-term future hedging cost allowed for within the EEV value of in-force business to reflect the derivatives expected to be held based on the Group's current dynamic hedging programme and consideration of past practice. Jackson also historically issued a/uni00A0small amount of income benefits (Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIB)), which are now materially fully reinsured.\n\nIn June 2020 the Group announced the reinsurance of substantially all of Jackson's in-force portfolio of fixed and fixed indexed annuity business to Athene Life Re Ltd. These contracts included some financial options and guarantees that are now materially fully reinsured as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Time value\n\nThe value of financial options and guarantees comprises the intrinsic value (arising from a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions) and the time value (arising from the variability of economic outcomes in the future).\n\nWhere appropriate, a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the time value of financial options and guarantees. The/uni00A0economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations. Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of long-term economic conditions. Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, such as separate modelling of individual asset classes with an allowance for correlations between various asset classes. Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in note 9(ii).\n\nIn deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled. Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, investment allocation decisions, levels of regular and/uni00A0final bonuses and credited rates. Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions. In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options available to management.\n\nThe time value of financial options and guarantees reflects how the market value of the assets (including derivatives) held to manage the liability portfolios are expected to vary across the range of economic scenarios considered. In some economic scenarios the derivative portfolio may project gains in excess of the cost of the underlying guarantees on an EEV basis. If the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees results in a positive outcome for a particular product then the figure is capped at zero, reflecting the strong interaction between the outcome of the central economic scenario and the time value of financial options and guarantees in these circumstances, and the reported value of in-force business before deduction of cost of capital and time value of options and guarantees will reflect the outcome from the full stochastic valuation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## (e) Level of required capital\n\nIn adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based required capital on the applicable local statutory regulations, including any amounts considered to be required above the local statutory minimum requirements to satisfy regulatory constraints. For shareholder-backed businesses, the following capital requirements for long-term business apply:\n\n- -Asia: the level of required capital has been set to an amount at least equal to local statutory notification requirements.\n- - For Singapore life operations, from 31 March 2020 the level of net worth and required capital is based on the Tier 1 Capital position under the new risk-based capital framework (RBC2), which removes certain negative reserves permitted to be recognised in the full RBC2 regulatory position applicable to the Group's LCSM position, in order to better reflect free surplus and its generation;\n- - For China JV life operations, the level of required capital follows the approach for embedded value reporting issued by the China Association of Actuaries (CAA) reflecting the C-ROSS regime; and\n- -US: the level of required capital has been set at 250 per cent of the risk-based capital (RBC) required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) at the Company Action Level (CAL).\n\n## (f) With-profits business and the treatment of the estate\n\nFor the Group's relevant Asia operations, the proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the with-profits funds has been based on the applicable profit distribution between shareholders and policyholders. The EEV methodology includes the value attributed to the shareholders' interest in the residual estate of the in-force with-profits business. In any scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders. As required, adjustments are also made to reflect any capital requirements for with-profits business in Asia in excess of the available capital of the with-profits funds.\n\n## (g) Internal asset management\n\nIn line with the EEV Principles, the in-force and new business results from long-term business include the projected future profit or loss from asset/uni00A0management and service companies that support the Group's covered insurance businesses. The results of the Group's asset management operations include the current period profit from the management of both internal and external funds. EEV basis shareholders' other income and/uni00A0expenditure is adjusted to deduct the expected profit anticipated to arise in the current period in the opening VIF from internal asset management and other services. This deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business./uni00A0Accordingly, Group operating profit includes the actual profit earned in respect of the management of these assets.\n\n## (h) Allowance for risk and risk discount rates Overview\n\nUnder the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows are set by reference to risk-free rates/uni00A0plus a risk margin.\n\nThe risk-free rates are largely based on local government bond yields at the valuation date and are assumed to remain constant throughout/uni00A0the/uni00A0projection, with no trending or mean reversion to longer-term assumptions that cannot be observed in the current market.\n\nThe risk margin reflects any non-diversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation. In order to better reflect differences in relative market risk volatility inherent in each product group, Prudential sets the risk discount rates to reflect the expected volatility associated with the expected future shareholder cash flows for each product group in the embedded value model, rather than at a Group level.\n\nSince financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, risk discount rates exclude the effect of these product features.\n\nThe risk margin represents the aggregate of the allowance for market risk, additional allowance for credit risk where appropriate, and allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk. No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.\n\n## Market risk allowance\n\nThe allowance for market risk represents the beta multiplied by the equity risk premium.\n\nThe beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk. The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product-specific cash flows. These are determined by considering how the profit from each product is affected by changes in expected returns across asset classes. By converting this into a relative rate of return, it is possible to derive a product-specific beta. This approach contrasts with a top-down approach to market risk where the risks associated with each product are not directly reflected in the valuation basis.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## 8 Methodology and accounting presentation continued\n\n## (i) Methodology continued\n\n## (h) Allowance for risk and risk discount rates continued\n\n## Additional credit risk allowance\n\nThe Group's methodology allows for credit risk. The total allowance for credit risk covers expected long-term defaults, a credit risk premium (to/uni00A0reflect the volatility in downgrade and default levels) and short-term downgrades and defaults.\n\nThese allowances are initially reflected in determining best estimate returns and through the market risk allowance described above. However, for those businesses largely backed by holdings of debt securities, the allowances in the projected returns and market risk allowances/uni00A0may not be sufficient and an additional allowance may be appropriate.\n\nThe practical application of the allowance for credit risk varies depending on the type of business as described below:\n\n## Asia\n\nFor Asia, the allowance for credit risk incorporated in the projected rates of return and the market risk allowance is considered to be sufficient. Accordingly, no additional allowance for credit risk is required.\n\nThe projected rates of return for holdings of corporate bonds comprise the risk-free rate plus an assessment of a term-dependent spread (net of an allowance for expected defaults) over the risk-free rate.\n\n## US\n\nFor Jackson, an allowance for long-term defaults, as shown in note 9(i)(b), is reflected in the risk margin reserve charge that is deducted in/uni00A0determining the projected spread margin between the earned rate on the investments and the policyholder crediting rate.\n\nThe risk discount rate incorporates an additional allowance for the credit risk premium and short-term downgrades and defaults, as/uni00A0shown/uni00A0in/uni00A0note 9(i)(b). In determining this allowance, a number of factors have been considered, in particular including:\n\n- -How much of the credit spread on debt securities represents an increased short-term credit risk not reflected in the risk margin reserve long-term default assumptions and how much is liquidity premium (which is the premium required by investors to compensate for the risk of/uni00A0longer-term investments that cannot be easily converted into cash at the fair market value). In assessing this effect, consideration has been given to a number of approaches to estimate the liquidity premium by considering recent statistical data; and\n- -Policyholder benefits for certain lines of business are not fixed. It is possible, in adverse economic scenarios, to pass on a component of credit losses to policyholders (subject to guarantee features), through lower investment returns credited to policyholders. Consequently, it is only necessary to allow for the balance of the credit risk in the risk discount rate.\n\nThe level of the additional allowance is assessed at each reporting period to take account of prevailing credit conditions and as the business in force alters over time. In 2020 the additional allowance for non-variable annuity business was increased by 50 basis points, primarily to reflect additional market volatility over the year. The additional allowance for variable annuity business has been set at one-fifth of the additional allowance for non-variable annuity business to reflect the long-term proportion of variable annuity business invested in general account debt/uni00A0securities.\n\n## Allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks\n\nThe majority of non-market and non-credit risks are considered to be diversifiable. An allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks is/uni00A0estimated as set out below.\n\nA base level allowance of 50 basis points is applied to cover the non-diversifiable non-market risks associated with the Group's covered business. For the Group's businesses in less mature markets (such as the Philippines and Thailand), additional allowances are applied for emerging market risk ranging from 100 to 250 basis points. The level and application of these allowances are reviewed and updated based on an/uni00A0assessment of the Group's exposure and experience in the markets. For the Group's business in more mature markets, no additional allowance is necessary. At 31 December 2020 the total allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk in Asia is equivalent to a $(3.2) billion reduction to the Asia EEV, or around (7) per cent of the embedded value.\n\n## (i)  Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the year. Foreign currency transactions are translated at/uni00A0the spot rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at closing exchange rates. The principal exchange rates are shown in note A1 of the Group IFRS financial statements.\n\n## (j) Taxation\n\nIn determining the post-tax profit for the year for covered business, the overall tax rate includes the impact of tax effects determined on a local regulatory basis. Tax payments and receipts included in the projected future cash flows to determine the value of in-force business are calculated using tax rates that have been announced and substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## (ii) Accounting presentation\n\n## (a) Analysis of post-tax profit\n\nTo the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV basis profit or loss for the year is consistent with the classification between operating and/uni00A0non-operating results that the Group applies for the analysis of IFRS basis results. Operating results are determined as described in note (b) below and incorporate the following:\n\n- -New business profit, as defined in note (i)(b) above;\n- -Expected return on existing business, as described in note (c) below;\n- -The impact of routine changes of estimates relating to operating assumptions, as described in note (d) below; and\n- -Operating experience variances, as described in note (e) below.\n\nIn addition, operating results include the effect of changes in tax legislation, unless these changes are one-off and structural in nature, or/uni00A0primarily/uni00A0affect the level of projected investment returns, in which case they are reflected as a non-operating result.\n\nNon-operating results comprise:\n\n- -Short-term fluctuations in investment returns;\n- -Mark-to-market value movements on core structural borrowings;\n- -Effect of changes in economic assumptions;\n- -Impact of NAIC reform and other related changes in the US in full year 2019; and\n- -The impact of corporate transactions undertaken in the year.\n\nTotal profit or loss in the year attributable to shareholders and basic earnings per share include these items, together with actual investment returns. The Group believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.\n\n## (b) Investment returns included in operating profit\n\nFor the investment element of the assets covering the total net worth of long-term insurance business, investment returns are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rates of return. These expected returns are calculated by reference to the asset mix of the portfolio.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the long-term returns for debt securities of Jackson for general account business, a risk margin reserve charge is included, which reflects the expected long-term rate of default based on the credit quality of the portfolio. For Jackson, interest-related realised gains and losses are amortised to the operating results over the maturity period of the sold bonds; for equity-related investments, a long-term rate/uni00A0of return is assumed (as shown in note 9(i)(b)), which reflects the aggregation of risk-free rates and the equity risk premium at the end of the reporting period. For variable annuity separate account business, operating profit includes the expected return on existing business adjusted to reflect projected rates of return at the end of the reporting period, with the excess or deficit of the actual return recognised within non-operating results, together with related hedging activity variances.\n\n## (c) Expected return on existing business\n\nExpected return on existing business comprises the expected unwind of discounting effects on the opening value of in-force business and required capital and the expected return on existing free surplus. The unwind of discount and the expected return on existing free surplus are determined after adjusting for the effect of changes in economic and operating assumptions in the current period on the embedded value at the beginning of the year, for example the unwind of discount on the value of in-force business and required capital is determined after adjusting both the opening value and the risk discount rates for the effect of changes in economic and operating assumptions in the current period.\n\n## (d) Effect of changes in operating assumptions\n\nOperating profit includes the effect of changes to operating assumptions on the value of in-force business at the end of the reporting period. For/uni00A0presentational purposes the effect of changes is delineated to show the effect on the opening value of in-force business as operating assumption changes, with the experience variances subsequently being determined by reference to the assumptions at the end of the reporting period, as discussed below.\n\n## (e) Operating experience variances\n\nOperating profit includes the effect of experience variances on operating assumptions, such as persistency, mortality, morbidity, expenses and/uni00A0other factors, which are calculated with reference to the assumptions at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## (f) Effect of changes in economic assumptions\n\nMovements in the value of in-force business at the beginning of the year caused by changes in economic assumptions, net of the related changes in the time value of financial options and guarantees, are recorded in non-operating results.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## 9 Assumptions\n\n## (i) Principal economic assumptions\n\nThe EEV basis results for the Group's covered business are determined using economic assumptions where both the risk discount rates and long-term expected rates of return on investments are set with reference to risk-free rates of return at the end of the reporting period. Both the risk discount rate and expected rates of return are updated at each valuation date to reflect current market risk-free rates, with the effect that changes in market risk-free rates impact all projected future cash flows. The risk-free rates of return are largely based on local government bond yields and are assumed to remain constant throughout the projection, with no trending or mean reversion to longer-term assumptions that cannot be observed in the current market. The risk-free rates of return are shown below for each of the Group's insurance operations. Expected returns on equity and property assets and corporate bonds are derived by adding a risk premium to the risk-free rate based on the Group's long-term view. Following the regular review of expected long-term returns across economies, equity risk premiums in the majority of business units were reduced by 50 basis points at 31 December 2020 from those applied at 31 December 2019, and the US dollar equity risk premium was increased by 60 basis points. Following an in-depth and more granular review of historic data across economies, long-term expected spreads (net of expected defaults) on corporate bonds were increased compared to the prior year. The related expected returns on equity and corporate bond assets and risk discount rates have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs described in note 8(i)(h), risk discount rates are set equal to the risk-free rate at the valuation date plus allowances for market risk, additional credit risk and non-diversifiable non-market risks appropriate to the features and risks of the underlying products and markets. Risks that are explicitly allowed for elsewhere in the EEV basis, such as via the cost of capital and the time value of options and guarantees (as set out in note 2), are not included in the risk discount rates.\n\nGiven the linkage to current risk-free rates, which are at historically low levels, risk discount rates at 31 December 2020 are generally lower than has historically been the case. Under our EEV methodology there is a corresponding reduction in assumed future investment returns, which/uni00A0will also be lower than historical norms, countering the impact of the lower risk discount rates.\n\n## (a) Asia notes (1)(2)\n\n|                                                      | Risk discount rate  %   | Risk discount rate  %   | Risk discount rate  %   | Risk discount rate  %   |                                    |                                    |                                |                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                      | New business            | New business            | In-force business       | In-force business       | 10-year government   bond yield  % | 10-year government   bond yield  % | Equity return   (geometric)  % | Equity return   (geometric)  % |\n|                                                      | 31 Dec 2020             | 31 Dec 2019             | 31 Dec 2020             | 31 Dec 2019             | 31 Dec 2020                        | 31 Dec 2019                        | 31 Dec 2020                    | 31 Dec 2019                    |\n| China JV                                             | 7.7                     | 8.2                     | 7.7                     | 8.2                     | 3.2                                | 3.2                                | 7.2                            | 7.7                            |\n| Hong Kong  note (1)                                  | 2.0                     | 3.7                     | 2.1                     | 3.7                     | 0.9                                | 1.9                                | 4.4                            | 4.8                            |\n| Indonesia                                            | 8.9                     | 10.8                    | 10.0                    | 10.8                    | 6.5                                | 7.2                                | 10.8                           | 11.9                           |\n| Malaysia                                             | 4.4                     | 5.8                     | 4.9                     | 5.9                     | 2.6                                | 3.3                                | 6.1                            | 7.3                            |\n| Philippines                                          | 10.3                    | 12.3                    | 10.3                    | 12.3                    | 3.1                                | 4.6                                | 7.3                            | 9.3                            |\n| Singapore                                            | 2.3                     | 3.3                     | 2.9                     | 3.9                     | 0.9                                | 1.7                                | 4.4                            | 5.7                            |\n| Taiwan                                               | 3.0                     | 3.4                     | 2.5                     | 3.0                     | 0.3                                | 0.7                                | 4.3                            | 5.2                            |\n| Thailand                                             | 8.5                     | 9.2                     | 8.5                     | 9.2                     | 1.3                                | 1.5                                | 5.5                            | 6.2                            |\n| Vietnam                                              | 4.3                     | 5.3                     | 4.5                     | 5.5                     | 2.6                                | 3.4                                | 6.8                            | 8.1                            |\n| Total weighted average (new business)  note (3)      | 4.1                     | 4.9                     | n/a                     | n/a                     | 2.1                                | 2.6                                | 5.8                            | 6.1                            |\n| Total weighted average (in-force business)  note (3) | n/a                     | n/a                     | 3.6                     | 4.9                     | 1.7                                | 2.6                                | 5.3                            | 6.1                            |\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) For Hong Kong, the assumptions shown are for US dollar denominated business.

The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain.\n\nAssumptions required in the calculation of the time value of financial options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.\n\n## Demographic assumptions\n\nPersistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience, and reflect expected future experience. Where/uni00A0relevant, when calculating the time value of financial options and guarantees, policyholder withdrawal rates vary in line with the emerging investment conditions according to management's expectations. When projecting future cash flows for medical reimbursement business that is/uni00A0repriced annually, explicit allowance is made for expected future premium inflation and separately for future medical claims inflation.\n\n## Expense assumptions\n\nExpense levels, including those of the service companies that support the Group's long-term business, are based on internal expense analysis and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of in-force business. For mature business, it is Prudential's policy not/uni00A0to take credit for future cost reduction programmes until the actions to achieve the savings have been delivered. An allowance is made for short-term required expenses that are not representative of the longer-term expense loadings of the relevant businesses. At 31 December 2020 the allowance held for these costs across the Group was $128 million, arising in Asia. Expense overruns are reported where these are expected to/uni00A0be short-lived, including businesses that are growing rapidly or are sub-scale.\n\nFor Asia, expenses comprise costs borne directly and costs recharged/allocated from the Group head office functions in London and Hong/uni00A0Kong that are attributable to the long-term insurance (covered) business. The assumed future expenses for the long-term insurance business allow for amounts expected to be recharged/allocated by the head office functions. Development expenses are allocated to Asia covered business and are charged as incurred.\n\nCorporate expenditure, which is included in other income and expenditure, comprises expenditure of the Group head office functions in London and Hong Kong that is not recharged/allocated to the long-term insurance or asset management operations, primarily for corporate related activities that are charged as incurred, together with restructuring and IFRS 17 implementation costs incurred across the Group.\n\n## Tax rates\n\nThe assumed long-term effective tax rates for operations reflect the expected incidence of taxable profit and loss in the projected future cash flows as explained in note 8(i)(j). The local standard corporate tax rates applicable for 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n\n|                  | %                                                |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Asia operations: |                                                  |\n| China JV         | 25.0                                             |\n| Hong Kong        | 16.5 per cent on 5 per cent of premium income    |\n| Indonesia  note  | 2019: 25.0; 2020 and 2021: 22.0; from 2022: 20.0 |\n| Malaysia         | 24.0                                             |\n| Philippines      | 30.0                                             |\n| Singapore        | 17.0                                             |\n| Taiwan           | 20.0                                             |\n| Thailand         | 20.0                                             |\n| Vietnam          | 20.0                                             |\n| US operations    | 21.0                                             |\n\n## Note\n\nReflects a reduction from 25 per cent effective in the first half of 2020.",

Given the relative immaturity of the Africa business, it is incorporated into the Group's EEV basis results on an IFRS basis and is excluded from new business sales and profit metrics.\n\n## 11 Post balance sheet events\n\n## Intention to demerge the Group's US operations in the second quarter of 2021\n\nIn January 2021, the Board announced that it had decided to pursue the separation of its US operations (Jackson) from the Group through a/uni00A0demerger, whereby shares in Jackson would be distributed to Prudential shareholders.\n\nSubject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, the planned demerger is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021 and would lead/uni00A0to a significantly earlier separation of Jackson from the Group than would have been possible through a minority IPO and future sell-downs, which from market precedent may have lasted until 2023. At the point of demerger, Prudential is planning to retain a 19.9 per cent non-controlling interest in Jackson, which will be reported within the consolidated financial position as a financial investment at fair value. Subject to market conditions, the Group intends to monetise a portion of this investment to support investment in Asia within 12 months of the planned demerger, such that the Group will own less than 10 per cent at the end of such period.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nE\n\nti\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to Prudential plc on the European Embedded Value (EEV) basis supplementary information\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the EEV basis supplementary information of Prudential plc ('the Company') for the year ended 31 December 2020 which comprise the EEV results highlights, movement in Group EEV shareholders' equity, movement in Group free surplus and related notes, including the basis of preparation on page 323. The EEV basis supplementary information should be read in conjunction with the Group financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the EEV basis supplementary information of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in 2016 ('the EEV Principles') using the methodology and assumptions set out in the Notes on the EEV basis results.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)'), including ISA (UK) 800, and the terms of our engagement. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.\n\n## Emphasis of matter - special purpose basis of preparation\n\nWe draw attention to page 323 of the EEV basis supplementary information. As explained on that page, the EEV basis supplementary information is prepared to provide additional information to users of the Group financial statements. As a result, the EEV basis supplementary information may not be suitable for another purpose. Our opinion is not/uni00A0modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Going Concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the EEV basis supplementary information on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the EEV basis supplementary information ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- -Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic environment which affect the valuations of the Group's investments, wider credit spreads and defaults and valuation of EEV shareholders' equity due to the impact of these market movements;\n- -The impact on regulatory capital solvency margins from movements in interest rates; and\n- -Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as failure of some of the Group's counterparties (such as banks and reinsurers) to meet commitments, which could give rise to a negative impact on the Group's financial position and liquidity, and wider economic factors such as the Coronavirus pandemic's impact on/uni00A0economic volatility and market uncertainty in the period, and other such macroeconomic events.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or solvency in the going concern period by assessing the Directors' sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by/uni00A0the Group's cash flow forecasts taking account of severe but plausible adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively.\n\nWe assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- -we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the EEV basis supplementary information is appropriate;\n- -we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period; and\n- -we found the going concern disclosure to be acceptable.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group will continue in operation.\n\nw\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

        "page_content": "## Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due/uni00A0to/uni00A0f r aud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- -Enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit, group security, and inspecting key papers provided to those charged with governance as to the high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing' and process for engaging local management to/uni00A0identify fraud risks specific to their business units, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected, or alleged/uni00A0fraud.\n- -Reading board and audit committee minutes.\n- -Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for directors.\n- -Consulted with professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group team to all component audit teams in scope of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and requests to these audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at/uni00A0Group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the/uni00A0risks of management override of controls, in particular the risk that/uni00A0group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements. Accordingly, we identified a fraud risk related to the selection of EEV operating assumptions given their direct/uni00A0impact on the Group's embedded value, the opportunity for/uni00A0management to manipulate assumptions due to the subjectivity involved and given the long-term nature of these assumptions which are more difficult to corroborate, and potential incentives for the group to manipulate the embedded value of both the US and Asia businesses given the planned separation of the US business.\n\nOn this audit we do not consider there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition as there is limited management judgement involved in the determination of all material revenue streams as the amounts are contractually derived.\n\nIn determining the audit procedures to address the identified fraud risks, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the group-wide anti-fraud risk controls. In order to address the risk of fraud specifically as it relates to the EEV operating assumptions, we involved actuarial specialists to assist in our challenge of management. We challenged management in relation to the selection of assumptions and the appropriateness of the rationale for any changes, the consistency of the selected assumptions across different aspects of the financial reporting process and comparison to/uni00A0our understanding of the product portfolio, trends in experience, policyholder behaviour and economic conditions and also by reference to market practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo address the pervasive risk as it relates to management override, we/uni00A0also performed procedures including:\n\n- -Identifying journal entries to test for all in-scope components, based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These include unusual journal entries related to non-recurring transactions.\n- -Evaluating the business purpose of non-recurring transactions.\n- -Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due/uni00A0to/uni00A0non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the EEV basis supplementary information from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors, and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence. We discussed with the/uni00A0directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulation.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an/uni00A0understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to/uni00A0all in-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the group level, and a request for these teams to report to/uni00A0the group any instances of non-compliance with said laws and regulations, or any identified local laws and regulations, that could give/uni00A0rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the EEV basis supplementary information varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the EEV basis supplementary information including taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related EEV basis supplementary information items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the EEV basis supplementary information, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or/uni00A0the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the area/uni00A0of/uni00A0regulatory capital as that most likely to have such an effect recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.",

        "page_content": "## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of/uni00A0law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the EEV basis supplementary information, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the EEV basis supplementary information, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of nondetection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the EEV basis supplementary information. Our opinion on the EEV basis supplementary information does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our EEV basis supplementary information audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the EEV basis supplementary information or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work, we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 348, the/uni00A0directors are responsible for: the preparation of the EEV basis supplementary information in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the European Insurance CFO/uni00A0Forum in 2016 ('the EEV Principles') using the methodology and/uni00A0assumptions set out in the Notes on the EEV basis results. They/uni00A0are/uni00A0also responsible for: such internal control as they determine is/uni00A0necessary to enable the preparation of EEV basis supplementary information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; determining that the basis of preparation is acceptable in the circumstances; assessing the Group's ability to continue as a/uni00A0going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do/uni00A0so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the EEV basis supplementary information as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the EEV basis supplementary information.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is/uni00A0provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## The purpose of our audit work and to whom we/uni00A0owe/uni00A0our/uni00A0responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we have been engaged to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philip Smart\n\nfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP Chartered Accountants London\n\n2 March 2021\n\n/uni00A0\n\nt\n\ns\n\no\n\nn",

Ultimately, Prudential will become subject to the Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework. The primary legislation was enacted in July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will also come into operation on 29 March 2021. The GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements.\n\nThe GWS methodology is expected to be largely consistent with that applied under LCSM with the exception of the treatment of debt instruments which will be subject to transitional arrangements under the GWS Framework. As agreed with the Hong Kong IA, only specific bonds (being those subordinated debt instruments issued by Prudential plc at the date of demerger of M&G plc) are currently included as eligible/uni00A0Group LCSM capital resources for the purposes of satisfying group minimum and prescribed capital requirements. Senior debt instruments issued by Prudential plc have not been included as part of the Group capital resources and are treated as a liability in the LCSM/uni00A0results. Under the GWS Framework, Prudential's initial analysis indicates that all debt instruments (senior and subordinated) issued by Prudential plc will meet the transitional conditions set by the Hong Kong IA and will be included as eligible Group capital resources. If/uni00A0this/uni00A0were/uni00A0to be the case, the 31 December 2020 Group shareholder LCSM coverage ratio (over GMCR) presented below would increase by/uni00A035/uni00A0percentage points to 363 per cent. This is subject to final approval by the Hong Kong IA.\n\nFurther detail on the LCSM is included in the basis of preparation section below.\n\nFor regulated insurance entities, the capital resources and required capital included in the LCSM measure for Hong Kong IA Group regulatory purposes are based on the local solvency regime applicable in each jurisdiction. At 31 December 2020, the Prudential Group's total surplus of capital resources over the regulatory Group Minimum Capital Requirement (GMCR), calculated using this LCSM was $26.4 billion, before allowing for the payment of the 2020 second interim ordinary dividend, equating to a coverage ratio of 329%.\n\nThe Group holds material participating business in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. If the capital resources and minimum capital requirement attributed to this policyholder business are excluded, then the Prudential Group shareholder LCSM surplus of capital resources over/uni00A0the regulatory GMCR at 31 December 2020 was $11.0 billion, before allowing for the payment of the 2020 second interim ordinary dividend, equating to a coverage ratio of 328%.\n\n## Estimated Group LCSM capital position based on Group Minimum Capital Requirement (GMCR)\n\n|                                         | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2020        | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2019   | 31 Dec 2019        | 31 Dec 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Amounts attributable to Prudential plc  | Total         | Less  policyholder | Shareholder   | Total         | Less  policyholder | Shareholder   |\n| Capital resources ($bn)                 | 37.9          | (22.1)             | 15.8          | 33.1          | (19.1)             | 14.0          |\n| Group Minimum Capital Requirement ($bn) | 11.5          | (6.7)              | 4.8           | 9.5           | (5.0)              | 4.5           |\n| LCSM surplus (over GMCR) ($bn)          | 26.4          | (15.4)             | 11.0          | 23.6          | (14.1)             | 9.5           |\n| LCSM ratio (over GMCR) (%)              | 329%          |                    | 328%          | 348%          |                    | 309%          |\n\nThe shareholder LCSM capital position by segment is presented below at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 for comparison:\n\n|                                        | 31 Dec 2020  $bn   | 31 Dec 2020  $bn   | 31 Dec 2020  $bn   | 31 Dec 2020  $bn   | 31 Dec 2020  $bn          | 31 Dec 2020  $bn   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                        |                    |                    | Shareholder        | Shareholder        | Shareholder               | Shareholder        |\n| Amounts attributable to Prudential plc | Total Asia         | Less policyholder  | Asia               | US                 | Unallocated to  a segment | Group total        |\n| Capital resources                      | 33.7               | (22.1)             | 11.6               | 4.6                | (0.4)                     | 15.8               |\n| Group Minimum Capital Requirement      | 10.1               | (6.7)              | 3.4                | 1.4                | -                         | 4.8                |\n| LCSM surplus (over GMCR)               | 23.6               | (15.4)             | 8.2                | 3.2                | (0.4)                     | 11.0               |\n\n|                                        | 31 Dec 2019  $bn   | 31 Dec 2019  $bn   | 31 Dec 2019  $bn   | 31 Dec 2019  $bn   | 31 Dec 2019  $bn          | 31 Dec 2019  $bn   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                        |                    |                    | Shareholder        | Shareholder        | Shareholder               | Shareholder        |\n| Amounts attributable to Prudential plc | Total Asia         | Less policyholder  | Asia               | US                 | Unallocated to  a segment | Group total        |\n| Capital resources                      | 26.8               | (19.1)             | 7.7                | 5.3                | 1.0                       | 14.0               |\n| Group Minimum Capital Requirement      | 8.0                | (5.0)              | 3.0                | 1.5                | -                         | 4.5                |\n| LCSM surplus (over GMCR)               | 18.8               | (14.1)             | 4.7                | 3.8                | 1.0                       | 9.5                |\n\nAll the amounts above are presented excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.

An/uni00A0exception to the instantaneous market movements assumed is the (40) per cent equity sensitivity where for Jackson an instantaneous 20 per cent market fall is assumed to be followed by a further market fall of 20 per cent over a four-week period with dynamic hedges assumed to/uni00A0be rebalanced over the period. Aside from this assumed dynamic hedge rebalancing for Jackson in the (40) per cent equity sensitivity, the sensitivity results only allow for limited management actions such as changes to future policyholder bonuses. If such economic conditions persisted, the financial impacts may differ to the instantaneous impacts shown above. In this case management could also take additional actions to help mitigate the impact of these stresses. These actions include, but are not limited to, rebalancing investment portfolios, further market risk hedging, increased use of reinsurance, repricing of in-force benefits, changes to new business pricing and the mix of new business being sold.\n\n## Analysis of movement in Group shareholder LCSM surplus\n\nA summary of the estimated movement in the Group shareholder LCSM surplus (based on GMCR) from $9.5 billion at 31 December 2019 to/uni00A0$11.0 billion at 31 December 2020 is set out in the table below.\n\n|                                                                                | 2020  $bn   | 2019  $bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 Jan                                                               | 9.5         | 9.7         |\n| Operating:                                                                     |             |             |\n| Operating capital generation from the in-force business                        | 2.2         | 2.5         |\n| Investment in new business                                                     | (0.2)       | (0.6)       |\n| Operating capital generation                                                   | 2.0         | 1.9         |\n| Non-operating and other capital movements:                                     |             |             |\n| Non-operating experience (including market movements)                          | (2.0)       | (0.6)       |\n| Regulatory changes                                                             | 2.2         | 0.1         |\n| Reinsurance of US fixed and fixed indexed annuity in-force portfolio to Athene | 0.8         | -           |\n| Athene US equity investment                                                    | (0.2)       | -           |\n| US hedge modelling revision                                                    | (0.4)       | -           |\n| Other corporate activities                                                     | (0.1)       | (0.8)       |\n| M&G Demerger costs                                                             | -           | (0.4)       |\n| Subordinated debt redemption                                                   | -           | (0.5)       |\n| M&G Demerger related impacts                                                   | -           | 1.0         |\n| Non-operating results                                                          | 0.3         | (1.2)       |\n| Remittances from discontinued operations (M&G plc)                             | -           | 0.7         |\n| External dividends                                                             | (0.8)       | (1.6)       |\n| Net dividend impact                                                            | (0.8)       | (0.9)       |\n| Net movement in LCSM surplus                                                   | 1.5         | (0.2)       |\n| Balance at 31 Dec                                                              | 11.0        | 9.5         |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The estimated movement in the Group shareholder LCSM surplus over 2020 is driven by:\n\n- -Operating capital generation of $2.0 billion: generated by the expected return on in-force business partially offset by the strain on/uni00A0new/uni00A0business written during the year;\n- -Non-operating experience of $(2.0) billion: this includes the negative impact of higher equity markets on Jackson's derivatives net of/uni00A0policyholder reserves and required capital movements, and the negative impact of falling interest rates on the US and Asia surplus over/uni00A0the/uni00A0year, partially offset by management actions, including the benefit from the change to the Hong Kong valuation interest rate as/uni00A0granted by the/uni00A0regulator in July 2020;\n- -Regulatory changes of $2.2 billion: reflecting the benefit from the new Singapore risk-based capital framework (RBC2) effective at 31 March/uni00A02020;\n- -Reinsurance of US fixed and fixed indexed annuity in-force portfolio to Athene of $0.8 billion: the impact of the transaction, which was effective at 1 June 2020, was an increase to LCSM surplus comprising of the ceding commission received and required capital released less/uni00A0tax/uni00A0and adverse consequential effects on the US's capital resources;\n- -Athene equity investment $(0.2) billion: this is the net effect on LCSM surplus of Athene's $500 million equity investment in Prudential's US/uni00A0business in return for an 11.1 per cent economic interest in that same business, which completed in July 2020;\n- -US hedge modelling revision of $(0.4) billion: at 31 December 2019, Jackson early adopted the provisions of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Valuation Manual Minimum Standards No. VM-21. During 2020, Jackson determined that a simplifying modelling assumption was not consistent with its intent in the adoption of VM-21 and the revised modelling adopted for calculating reserves and capital reduced surplus by $390 million;\n- -Other Corporate activities (excluding demerger items) of $(0.1) billion: this is the effect on LCSM surplus of other corporate transactions in/uni00A0the/uni00A0period, which in 2020 comprised mainly of a $0.8 billion benefit from the reinsurance transaction in Hong Kong described in note D1.1 of/uni00A0the IFRS financial statements, offset by $(0.9) billion principally from the strategic bancassurance partnership with TMB in Thailand; and -Net dividend impact of $(0.8) billion: this is the payment of external dividends during 2020.\n\n## Reconciliation of Group shareholder LCSM surplus to EEV free surplus (excluding intangibles)\n\n|                                                                                |       | 31 Dec 2020   | $bn                       |             | 31 Dec 2019  $bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                | Asia  | US            | Unallocated  to a segment | Group total | Group total        |\n| Estimated Group shareholder LCSM surplus (over GMCR)                           | 8.2   | 3.2           | (0.4)                     | 11.0        | 9.5                |\n| Increase required capital for EEV free surplus  note (1)                       | (0.8) | (2.0)         | -                         | (2.8)       | (2.8)              |\n| Adjust surplus assets and core structural borrowings to market value  note (2) | 0.5   | 0.3           | (0.4)                     | 0.4         | 0.3                |\n| Add back inadmissible assets  note (3)                                         | 0.2   | 0.1           | -                         | 0.3         | 0.2                |\n| Deductions applied to EEV free surplus  note (4)                               | (3.1) | -             | -                         | (3.1)       | (0.9)              |\n| Other                                                                          | -     | 0.1           | 0.2                       | 0.3         | 0.3                |\n| EEV free surplus excluding intangibles *                                       | 5.0   | 1.7           | (0.6)                     | 6.1         | 6.6                |\n\n- * As per the 'Free surplus excluding distribution rights and other intangibles' shown in the statement of Movement in Group free surplus of the Group's EEV basis results.\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) Required capital under EEV is set at least equal to local statutory notification requirements for Asia and so can differ from the minimum capital requirement. Jackson required capital is set at/uni00A02 50 per cent of the risk-based capital (RBC) required by the NAIC at the Company Action Level (CAL). This is higher than the solo legal entity statutory minimum capital requirement of 100 per cent CAL that is included in the LCSM surplus (over GMCR).\n- (2) The EEV Principles require surplus assets to be included at fair value and central core senior debt is held at market value. Within LCSM surplus, some local regulatory regimes value certain assets at cost and core senior debt is held at amortised cost.\n- (3) LCSM restricts the valuation of certain sundry non-intangible assets. In most cases these assets are considered fully recognisable in free surplus. As an exception to this, both LCSM surplus and EEV free surplus restrict the deferred tax asset held by Jackson to the level allowed to be admitted by the local regulator in local statutory capital resources.\n- (4) Deductions applied to EEV free surplus primarily include: the impact of reporting EEV free surplus for Singapore based on the Tier 1 requirements under the RBC2 framework, which removes certain negative reserves permitted to be recognised in the full RBC 2 regulatory position used for LCSM, and applying the embedded value reporting approach issued by the China Association of Actuaries (CAA) within EEV free surplus as compared to the C-ROSS surplus reported for local regulatory purposes (predominantly arising from the requirement under the CAA embedded value methodology to establish a deferred profit liability within EEV net worth).",

Material differences arise in Jackson where IFRS variable annuity guarantee reserves are valued on a fair value basis compared to local statutory reserves which reflect long-term historic rates. Further, local US statutory reserves are reduced by an expense allowance linked to surrender charges, whereas IFRS makes no such allowance but instead defers acquisition costs on the balance sheet as a separate asset (which is not recognised on the statutory balance sheet). Other material differences include in Singapore where the local capital resources under RBC2 permits the recognition of certain negative reserves in the local statutory position that are not recognised under IFRS.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nIn advance of the GWS Framework coming into force, Prudential applies the local capital summation method (LCSM) that has been agreed with the Hong Kong IA to determine group regulatory capital requirements (both minimum and prescribed levels). The summation of local statutory capital requirements across the Group is used to determine group regulatory capital requirements, with no allowance for diversification between business operations. The Group capital resources is determined by the summation of capital resources across local solvency regimes for regulated entities and IFRS net assets (with adjustments described below) for non-regulated entities.\n\nIn determining the LCSM capital resources and required capital the following principles have been applied:\n\n- -For regulated insurance entities, capital resources and required capital are based on the local solvency regime applicable in each jurisdiction, with minimum required capital set at the solo legal entity statutory minimum capital requirements. The treatment of participating funds is/uni00A0consistent with the local basis;\n- -For the US insurance entities, capital resources and required capital are based on the local US RBC framework set by the NAIC, with minimum/uni00A0required capital set at 100 per cent of the CAL RBC;\n- -For asset management operations and other regulated entities, the shareholder capital position is derived based on the sectoral basis applicable in each jurisdiction, with minimum required capital based on the solo legal entity statutory minimum capital requirement;\n- -For non-regulated entities, the capital resources is based on IFRS net assets after deducting intangible assets. No required capital is held in/uni00A0respect of unregulated entities;\n- -For entities where the Group's shareholding is less than 100%, the contribution of the entity to the Group LCSM capital resources and required/uni00A0capital represents the Group's share of these amounts and excludes any amounts attributable to non-controlling interests;\n- -Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (including, if any, loans that are recognised as capital on the receiving entity's balance sheet) are eliminated from the relevant holding company to prevent the double counting of capital resources; and\n- -The Hong Kong IA has agreed that specific bonds (being those subordinated debt instruments issued by Prudential plc at the date of demerger of M&G plc) can be included as part of the Group's capital resources for the purposes of satisfying group minimum and prescribed capital requirements. Senior debt instruments issued by Prudential plc have not been included as part of the Group capital resources and are treated as a liability in the LCSM results presented above.",

The implicit rates may therefore differ from that applied to present the holding company cash flow in US dollars (see note (g)).\n- (c) $55 million remittances from other operations reflects intragroup interest income which is not expected to recur.\n- (d) The net interest paid in 2019 included $231 million on debt substituted to M&G plc prior to its demerger in October 2019.\n- (e) Other corporate activities relating to continuing operations primarily reflect payments made for bancassurance arrangements including those with UOB and TMB Bank.\n- (f) Transactions to effect the demerger represented the effects on holding company cash flow of steps taken in 2019 as part of the preparation for the demerger of the UK and Europe operations (M&G plc). These included the transfer of subsidiaries, settlement of intercompany loans, receipt of the pre-demerger dividend and the substitution of M&G plc as issuer of certain subordinated debt in place of Prudential plc.\n- (g) At 31 December 2019, the Group changed its basis of managing central cash-holdings from sterling to US dollars. Accordingly, the 2020 holding company cash flow statement presented above has been prepared directly in US dollars and 2019 amounts are re-presented from those previously published to reflect the change. 2019 comparatives were prepared in sterling, reflecting the management of holding company cash at that time. Cash movements in the year were converted from sterling into US dollars by using the month-end sterling to US dollar exchange rate for the month in which the transaction occurred. Cash balances at the start and end of the year were translated from sterling to US dollars using the spot rates at the beginning and end of the year respectively. As an exception to the above, external dividends paid during 2019 were translated at the exchange rate relevant to the day they were paid to ensure consistency with the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.\n- -Fee income represents profit driven by net investment performance, being fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds, net of investment management expenses.\n- -With-profits represents the pre-tax shareholders' transfer from the with-profits business for the period.\n- -Insurance margin primarily represents profit derived from the insurance risks of mortality and morbidity.\n- -Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses (see/uni00A0below).\n- -Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the period attributable to shareholders. These exclude items/uni00A0such as restructuring and IFRS 17 implementation costs, which are not included in the segment profit, as well as items that are more appropriately included in other categories (eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate).\n- -DAC adjustments comprise DAC amortisation for the period, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net/uni00A0of costs deferred in respect of new business written in the period.\n\n## (a) Margin analysis\n\nThe following analysis expresses certain of the Group's sources of adjusted operating profit as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other relevant drivers. The 2019 comparative information has been presented at both AER and CER to eliminate the impact of exchange translation. CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rates. All CER profit figures have been translated at current year average rates. For Asia, CER average liabilities have been translated using the corresponding current year opening and/uni00A0closing or quarterend closing exchange rates.\n\n|                                                                 | 2020              | 2020            | 2020           | 2020                 | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|------------|\n|                                                                 | Asia  $m note (b) | US  $m note (c) | Group total $m | Average liability $m | Margin bps |\n| Spread income                                                   | 296               | 521             | 817            | 86,596               | 94         |\n| Fee income                                                      | 282               | 3,386           | 3,668          | 217,863              | 168        |\n| With-profits                                                    | 117               | -               | 117            | 73,375               | 16         |\n| Insurance margin                                                | 2,648             | 1,298           | 3,946          |                      |            |\n| Margin on revenues                                              | 2,936             | -               | 2,936          |                      |            |\n| Expenses:                                                       |                   |                 |                |                      |            |\n| Acquisition costs *                                             | (1,904)           | (991)           | (2,895)        | 5,619                | (52)%      |\n| Administration expenses                                         | (1,539)           | (1,744)         | (3,283)        | 312,215              | (105)      |\n| DAC adjustments                                                 | 382               | 317             | 699            |                      |            |\n| Expected return on shareholder assets                           | 212               | -               | 212            |                      |            |\n|                                                                 | 3,430             | 2,787           | 6,217          |                      |            |\n| Share of related tax charges from joint ventures and associates | (46)              | -               | (46)           |                      |            |\n| Adjusted operating profit from long-term business               | 3,384             | 2,787           | 6,171          |                      |            |\n| Adjusted operating profit from asset management                 | 283               | 9               | 292            |                      |            |\n| Total segment adjusted operating profit                         | 3,667             | 2,796           | 6,463          |                      |            |\n\n- * The ratio of acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of APE sales in the year.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

The 2019 margins have been amended for consistency albeit impacts are minimal.\n- (2) Margin represents the operating return earned in the year as a proportion of the relevant class of policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

The average liabilities for fee income in the US have been calculated using daily balances instead of month-end balances in order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the fee income, which is charged on the daily account balance. Average liabilities for spread income are based on the general account liabilities to which spread income is attached and exclude the liabilities reinsured to Athene since the June 2020 month-end balance. Average liabilities used to calculate the administration expenses margin exclude the REALIC liabilities reinsured to third parties prior to the acquisition by Jackson and the liabilities reinsured to Athene since the June 2020 month-end balance.\n- (2) Margin represents the operating return earned in the period as a proportion of the relevant class of policyholder liabilities.\n- (3) The ratio of acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of APE sales relating to shareholder-backed business.\n- (4) Analysis of adjusted operating profit from long-term business before and after acquisition costs and DAC adjustments is shown below:\n\n2020\n\n$m\n\n|                                                                              | Before  acquisition        | Acquisition costs   and DAC adjustments   | Acquisition costs   and DAC adjustments   | After  acquisition         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                                              | costs and DAC  adjustments | Incurred                                  | Deferred                                  | costs and DAC  adjustments |\n| Total adjusted operating profit before acquisition costs and DAC adjustments | 3,461                      | -

Although circa 8 per cent of the embedded value for Asia operations emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown is considered most meaningful. The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Group's embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare/uni00A0our 2020 results.\n\nPost its separation from the Group, Jackson will no longer publish EEV results and so this section covers Asia only.\n\nIn addition to showing the amounts, on both a discounted and undiscounted basis, expected to be generated from all in-force business at/uni00A031 December 2020, the table also presents the future free surplus expected to be generated from the investment made in new business during/uni00A02020 over the same 40-year period.\n\n|                                                            | 31 Dec 2020  $m Asia long-term business operations   | 31 Dec 2020  $m

In Asia, the effect of generally lower interest rates across the region decreasing projected returns is partially offset by the increase from new business of $4.7 billion, together with/uni00A0favourable foreign exchange gains and operating assumption updates following the annual review of experience.\n\nActual underlying free surplus generated in 2020 from Asia long-term business in force at the end of 2019, before restructuring and IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0implementation costs, was $2.2 billion, including $0.2 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.

Executive/uni00A0Directors and eligible employees based in the UK may participate in the Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme. Executives/uni00A0and eligible employees based in Asia can participate in the Prudential International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, while/uni00A0agents based in/uni00A0certain regions of Asia can participate in the Prudential International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme for Non-Employees. Further/uni00A0details of the schemes and accounting policies are detailed in note B2.2 of the IFRS basis consolidated financial/uni00A0statements.\n\nAll options were granted at nil consideration. No options have been granted to substantial shareholders, suppliers of goods or services (excluding options granted to agents under the Prudential International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme for Non-Employees) or in excess of the individual limit for the relevant scheme. The maximum share entitlement of each participant under the relevant scheme for each option granted is limited to the total savings and any bonus or interest accumulated under that participant's savings contract, divided by the exercise price. At 31 December 2020, the maximum number of shares issued or issuable under the schemes, which were approved by shareholders, to/uni00A0all/uni00A0par ticipants would not exceed 1 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company in the preceding 12-month period.\n\nThe option schemes will terminate as follows, unless the Directors resolve to terminate the plans at an earlier date:\n\n- -Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme: 16 May 2023;\n- -Prudential International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme: 19 May 2021; and\n- -Prudential International Savings-Related Share Option Scheme for Non-Employees 2012: 12 May 2022.\n\nThe weighted average share price of Prudential plc for the year ended 31 December 2020 was \u00a311.64 (2019: \u00a315.05).\n\nParticulars of options granted to Directors are included in the Directors' remuneration report on page 191.\n\nThe closing prices of the shares immediately before the date on which the options were granted during the year were \u00a311.00.\n\nThe following analyses show the movement in options for each of the option schemes for the year ended 31 December 2020.",

It is not the result attributable to shareholders.\n- (ii) Adjusted operating profit and EEV operating profit are determined on the basis of including longer-term investment returns, which are stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business and gain or loss attaching to corporate transactions. Separately, for IFRS basis results, adjusted operating profit also excludes amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business. For EEV basis results, operating profit also excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the mark-to-market value movements on core structural borrowings for shareholder-financed operations.\n- (iii) Funds under management comprise funds of the Group held in the statement of financial position and external funds that are managed by the Group's asset management operations.\n- (iv) The 2020 and 2019 surplus are estimated under the LCSM regime adopted by the Group in October 2019, with 2018 comparative information re-presented on this basis.

This section sets out explanations for each APM and reconciliations to relevant IFRS balances.\n\n## II(i) Reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to profit before tax\n\nAdjusted operating profit presents the operating performance of the business.

This measure has been calculated as adjusted operating profit after tax, and net of non-controlling interests, divided by average shareholders' equity. Accordingly, the calculation of the return on IFRS shareholders' equity has been aligned to be based on average shareholders' equity. The 2019 returns disclosed in the table below are consistent with those previously published and use profit from continuing operations and closing shareholders' equity. As supplementary information, 2019 Asia and US returns on shareholders' equity have also been presented on an average shareholders' equity basis.\n\nA detailed reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to IFRS profit before tax for the Group is shown in note B1.1 to the Group IFRS basis/uni00A0results.\n\n|                                                                     | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                     | Asia       | US         | Other      | Group      |\n| Adjusted operating profit                                           | 3,667      | 2,796      | (956)      | 5,507      |\n| Tax on adjusted operating profit                                    | (495)      | (313)      | 8          | (800)      |\n| Operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests          | (11)       | (138)      | 1          | (148)      |\n| Adjusted operating profit, net of tax and non-controlling interests | 3,161      | 2,345      | (947)      | 4,559      |\n| Average shareholders' equity                                        | 12,377     | 8,720      | (919)      | 20,178     |\n| Operating return on average shareholders' equity (%)                | 26%        | 27%        | n/a        | 23%        |\n\n2019\n\n$m\n\n| Continuing operations                                                | Asia   | US    | Other   | Group   | Add back  demerger- related items *   | Adjusted Group (excluding demerger- related items)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted operating profit                                            | 3,276  | 3,070 | (1,036) | 5,310   | 179                                   | 5,489                                                |\n| Tax on adjusted operating profit                                     | (436)  | (437) | 100     | (773)   | (34)                                  | (807)                                                |\n| Operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests           | (6)    | -     | (3)     | (9)     | -                                     | (9)                                                  |\n| Adjusted operating profit, net of tax and non-controlling  interests | 2,834  | 2,633 | (939)   | 4,528   | 145                                   | 4,673                                                |\n| Closing shareholders' equity                                         | 10,866 | 8,929 | (318)   | 19,477  | -                                     | 19,477                                               |\n| Operating return on closing shareholders' equity (%)                 | 26%    | 29%   | n/a     | 23%     | -                                     | 24%                                                  |\n| Supplementary information:                                           |        |       |         |         |                                       |                                                      |\n| Average shareholders' equity                                         | 9,521  | 8,046 |         |         |                                       |                                                      |\n| Operating return on average shareholders' equity (%)                 | 30%    | 33%   |         |         |                                       |                                                      |\n\nAverage shareholders' equity has been based on opening and closing balances as follows:\n\n|                              | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m   |\n|------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                              | Asia       | US         | Other      | Group      | Asia       | US         |\n| Balance at 1 Jan             | 10,866     | 8,929      | (318)      | 19,477     | 8,175      | 7,163      |\n| Balance at 31 Dec            | 13,887     | 8,511      | (1,520)    | 20,878     | 10,866     | 8,929      |\n| Average shareholders' equity | 12,377     | 8,720      | (919)      | 20,178     | 9,521      | 8,046      |",

APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular premiums and one-tenth of single premiums on new business written during the year for all insurance products, including premiums for contracts designated as investment contracts under IFRS 4. The use of the one-tenth of single premiums is to normalise policy premiums into the equivalent of regular annual payments. This measure is commonly used in the insurance industry to allow comparisons of the amount of new business written in a period by life insurance companies, particularly when the sales contain both single premium and regular premium business.\n\nThis differs from the IFRS measure of gross premiums earned as shown below:\n\n|                                                                                                  | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2020  $m               | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m   | 2019  $m                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------------|------------|------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                                                  | Asia       | US         | Total segment note (a) | Asia       | US         | Total  segment note (a) |\n| Gross premiums earned                                                                            | 23,341     | 19,026     | 42,367                 | 23,757     | 21,209     | 44,966                  |\n| Less: premiums from in-force renewal business  note (b)                                          | (18,166)   | (845)      | (19,011)               | (17,236)   | (956)      | (18,192)                |\n| Adjustment to include 10% of single premiums  note (c)                                           | (2,131)    | (17,306)   | (19,437)               | (2,606)    | (20,008)   | (22,614)                |\n| Add: deposit accounting for investment contracts  note (d)                                       | -          | 1,284      | 1,284                  | 255        | 2,522      | 2,777                   |\n| Inclusion of APE Sales from joint ventures and associates  on equity accounting method  note (e) | 820        | -          | 820                    | 899        | -          | 899                     |\n| Other adjustments  note (f)                                                                      | (168)      | (236)      | (404)                  | 92         | (544)      | (452)                   |\n| Annual premium equivalents (APE)                                                                 | 3,696      | 1,923      | 5,619                  | 5,161      | 2,223      | 7,384                   |\n\n## Notes\n\n## II(viii) Reconciliation between IFRS and EEV shareholders' equity\n\nThe table below shows the reconciliation of EEV shareholders' equity and IFRS shareholders' equity at the end of the year:\n\n|                                                                  | 31 Dec 2020  $m   | 31 Dec 2019  $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| EEV shareholders' equity                                         | 54,007            | 54,711            |\n| Less: Value of in-force business of long-term business  note (a) | (41,007)          | (41,893)          |\n| Deferred acquisition costs assigned zero value for EEV purposes  | 16,216            | 14,239            |\n| Other  note (b)                                                  | (8,338)           | (7,580)           |\n| IFRS shareholders' equity                                        | 20,878            | 19,477            |\n\n## Notes",

The risk factors mentioned below should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The information given is as of the date of this document, and any forward-looking statements are made subject to the/uni00A0reservations specified under 'Forward-looking statements'.\n\nPrudential's approaches to managing risks are explained in the section of this document headed 'Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer's report on the risks facing our business and how these are managed'.\n\n## 1. Risks relating to Prudential's financial situation\n\n1.1  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on financial market volatility and global economic activity, increased operational disruption risks to the Group and has adversely impacted Prudential's sales in affected markets and its financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The full extent of the longer-term impacts from the pandemic remains uncertain\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased the volatility of equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads, reduced market liquidity and reduced global economic activity. The potential adverse impacts to the Group of these effects are detailed in the Financial Market and Economic Conditions risk factor detailed below. However, the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on financial markets and economic growth remains highly uncertain and unpredictable and will be influenced by the actions of governments, policymakers and the public. This includes the duration and effectiveness of mitigating measures against the current and future strains of the coronavirus, including a continued reliance on restrictions of movement and the deployment of vaccination programmes (which may occur over a prolonged period of time), the effectiveness and timing of which remains uncertain across markets. Where these impacts are prolonged, this may affect the solvency position of Prudential's subsidiaries and prevent or limit their ability to make remittances, adversely impacting the financial condition and prospects of the/uni00A0Group.\n\nThe immediate regulatory and supervisory responses to the Covid-19 pandemic have been broad and have included increased scrutiny of the operational resilience, liquidity and capital strength (including the impact of making dividend payments) of financial services companies. Various governments have effected, or may effect, the postponement of elections and other constitutional or legislative processes in response to the pandemic, and this may result in an increase in constitutional and political uncertainty in the markets in which the Group operates. Governments are either starting or planning the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccination programmes, and accessibility to vaccine supplies has the potential to contribute to an increase in geopolitical tensions. The longer term political, regulatory and supervisory developments resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic remain highly uncertain. These may include changes to government fiscal policies, laws or regulations aimed at increasing financial stability and/or measures on businesses or specific industries to contribute to, lessen or otherwise support, the financial cost to governments in addressing the pandemic. This may include requirements on private insurance companies and healthcare providers to cover the costs associated with the treatment of Covid-19 beyond contractual or policy terms.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, and measures to contain it, have slowed economic and social activity in the Group's geographical markets. While these conditions persist, the level of sales activity in affected markets has been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted through a reduction in travel and agency and bancassurance activity, which may be prolonged in markets which continue to rely on containment measures based on restrictions of movement rather than vaccine deployment. The impact to economic activity and employment levels may result in an elevated incidence of claims, lapses, or surrenders of/uni00A0policies, and some policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying/uni00A0insurance premiums or reduce deposits into retirement plans./uni00A0The/uni00A0pandemic may also indirectly result in elevated claims and/uni00A0policy/uni00A0lapses or surrenders, and with some delay in time before being felt/uni00A0by/uni00A0the Group, due to factors such as policyholders deferring medical/uni00A0treatment during the pandemic, or policyholders lapsing or surrendering their policies on the expiry of grace periods for premium payments provided by the Group's businesses. Extended restrictions on movement in particular may adversely impact product persistency in the Group's Asia business. While these impacts to the Group have not been material to date, the full extent of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is currently highly uncertain and the Group's claims experience to date and its current insurance assumptions cannot be taken as an indicator of future potential experience from the Covid-19 pandemic which may deteriorate significantly and have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of/uni00A0operations and prospects.\n\nDisruption to Prudential's operations may result where its employees, or those of its service partners and counterparties, contract the coronavirus or are affected by restrictions on movement; where office closures and other measures impacting working practices are effected, such as the imposition of remote working arrangements; and where quarantine requirements and isolation measures under local laws apply, and as a result of social distancing and/or other psychosocial impacts. While such measures are in place, there may be an increase in/uni00A0attempts to compromise IT systems through phishing and social engineering tactics.\n\nIn some markets Prudential has implemented changes to its sales and distribution processes. These include virtual face-to-face sales of its products and the online recruitment, training and, where possible, licensing of agents. Such changes may increase or introduce new operational and regulatory risks, in particular those focused on customer outcomes and conduct. A failure to implement appropriate governance and management of these new or incremental risks may adversely impact Prudential's reputation and brand and the results of/uni00A0its operations. In markets where the level of sales under these new processes is material or where such processes become permanent distribution channels, the commercial value of the Group's existing sale and distribution arrangements, such as bancassurance arrangements, may be adversely impacted.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 Prudential's businesses are inherently subject to market fluctuations and general economic conditions, each of which may adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects\n\nUncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in international economic and investment climates could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business and profitability. Prudential operates in a macroeconomic and global financial market environment that presents significant uncertainties and potential challenges. For example, during 2020 interest rates in the United States ('US') and some Asian countries in which Prudential operates have decreased to historic lows driven by the responses of central banks to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The transition to a lower carbon economy may also impact long-term asset valuations.\n\nGlobal financial markets are subject to uncertainty and volatility created by a variety of factors. These factors include slowdowns or reversals in world economic growth (particularly where this is abrupt, as has been the case with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic), fluctuations in global energy prices, changes in monetary policy in China, the US and/uni00A0other jurisdictions together with their impact on the valuation of all asset classes and effect on interest rates and inflation expectations, and concerns over sovereign debt. Other factors include the increased level of (geo)political risk and policy-related uncertainty (including the broader market impacts resulting from the trade negotiations between the US and China) and socio-political, climate-driven and pandemic events. The extent of financial market and economic impact of these factors may be highly uncertain and unpredictable and influenced by the actions, including the duration and effectiveness of mitigating measures of governments, policymakers and the public.\n\nThe adverse effects of such factors could be felt principally through the/uni00A0following items:\n\n- -Lower interest rates and reduced investment returns arising on the/uni00A0Group's portfolios including impairment of debt securities and loans, which could reduce Prudential's capital and impair its ability to write significant volumes of new business, increase the potential adverse impact of product guarantees included in Jackson's variable annuities and non-unit-linked products with a savings component in Asia, increase reinvestment risk for some of the Group's investments from accelerated prepayments and increased redemptions and/or have a negative impact on its assets under management and profit.\n- -A reduction in the financial strength and flexibility of corporate entities which may result in a deterioration of the credit rating profile and valuation of the Group's invested credit portfolio (which may result in an increase in regulatory capital requirements for the Group or its businesses), as well as higher credit defaults and wider credit and liquidity spreads resulting in realised and unrealised credit losses. Similarly, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in the Group's investment portfolio are subject to default risk and may be adversely impacted by delays or failures of borrowers to make payments of principal and interest when due.\n- -Failure of counterparties who have transactions with Prudential (such as banks, reinsurers and counterparties to derivative transactions) to meet commitments that could give rise to a negative impact on Prudential's financial position and on the accessibility or recoverability of amounts due or, for derivative transactions, adequate collateral not being in place. Concentrations of counterparty credit risk could exacerbate the impact of these events where they materialise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Estimates of the value of financial instruments becoming more difficult because in certain illiquid or closed markets, determining the value at which financial instruments can be realised is highly subjective. Processes to ascertain such values require substantial elements of judgement, assumptions and estimates (which may change over time). Where the Group is required to sell its investments within a defined timeframe, such market conditions may result in the sale of these investments at below expected or/uni00A0recorded prices.\n- -The Group holds certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as privately placed fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, complex structured securities and alternative investments. If these investments were required to be liquidated on short notice, the Group may experience difficulty in doing so and may be forced to sell them at/uni00A0a/uni00A0lower price than it otherwise would have been able to realise.\n- -A reduction in revenue from the Group's products where fee income is linked to account values or the market value of the funds under management. In particular, equity price falls impact the amount of revenue derived from fees from the unit-linked products in the Group's Asia business and from annuity contracts at Jackson, where fees are charged on account and asset values.\n- -Increased illiquidity, which includes the risk that expected cash inflows from investments and operations will not be adequate to/uni00A0meet the Group's anticipated short-term and long-term policyholder benefits and expense payment obligations. Increased illiquidity also adds to uncertainty over the accessibility of financial resources which in extreme conditions can impact the functioning of markets and may reduce capital resources as valuations decline. This could occur where external capital is unavailable at sustainable cost, increased liquid assets are required to be held as collateral under derivative transactions or redemption restrictions are placed on Prudential's investments in illiquid funds. In addition, significant redemption requests could also be made on Prudential's issued funds and while this may not have a direct impact on the Group's liquidity, it could result in reputational damage to Prudential. The potential impact of increased illiquidity is more uncertain than for other risks such as interest rate or credit risk.\n\nIn general, upheavals in the financial markets may affect general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behaviour. As a result, insurers may experience an elevated incidence of claims, lapses, or surrenders of policies, and some policyholders may choose to defer or/uni00A0stop paying insurance premiums or reduce deposits into retirement plans. The demand for insurance products may also be adversely affected. In addition, there may be a higher incidence of counterparty failures. If sustained, this environment is likely to have a negative impact on the insurance sector over time and may consequently have a/uni00A0negative impact on Prudential's business and its balance sheet and profitability. For example, this could occur if the recoverable value of/uni00A0intangible assets for bancassurance agreements and deferred acquisition costs are reduced. New challenges related to market fluctuations and general economic conditions may continue to emerge.",

        "page_content": "For some non-unit-linked products with a savings component, in particular those written in some of the Group's Asia operations, it may not be possible to hold assets which will provide cash flows to match those relating to policyholder liabilities. This is particularly true in those countries where bond markets are less developed and in certain markets where regulated premium and claim values are set with reference to the interest rate environment prevailing at the time of/uni00A0policy issue. This results in a mismatch due to the duration and uncertainty of the liability cash flows and the lack of sufficient assets of/uni00A0a suitable duration. While this residual asset/liability mismatch risk can be managed, it cannot be eliminated. Where interest rates in these markets remain lower than those used to calculate premium and claim values over a sustained period, this could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's reported profit and the solvency of its business units. In addition, part of the profit from the Group's Asia operations is related to bonuses for policyholders declared on with-profits products, which are impacted by the difference between actual investment returns of the with-profits fund (which are broadly based on historical and current rates of return on equity, real estate and fixed income securities) and minimum guarantee rates offered to policyholders. This/uni00A0profit could be lower in particular in a sustained low interest rate/uni00A0environment.\n\nJackson writes a significant amount of variable annuities that offer capital or income protection guarantees. The value of these guarantees is affected by market factors (such as interest rates, equity values, bond spreads and realised volatility) and policyholder behaviour. Changes in markets, or deviations in policyholder behaviour experience from assumptions, may result in the need to hold additional reserves for these products, which may impact Jackson's liquidity, require it to raise additional capital and/or adversely impact its net income. Jackson uses a derivative hedging programme to reduce its exposure to market risks arising on these guarantees. There may be circumstances where the derivatives that Jackson enters into to hedge its market risks may not sufficiently or effectively offset its exposures under the guarantees, or/uni00A0where its exposures may be over-hedged. This includes circumstances where:\n\n- -The derivative markets for the instruments which most appropriately reflect the equity funds in which policyholders have/uni00A0invested may not be of sufficient size or liquidity to effectively hedge these risks;\n- -Operational errors occur in the execution of Jackson's hedging strategy; or\n- -Actual experience materially deviates from the assumptions used in/uni00A0the models which inform Jackson's hedging strategy. These assumptions include, amongst others, mortality, lapse, surrender and withdrawal rates and amounts of withdrawals, election rates, fund performance, equity market returns and volatility, interest rate/uni00A0levels and correlation among various market movements.\n\nIf the results from Jackson's hedging programmes do not correlate with/uni00A0the economic effect of changes in benefit exposures to customers, it could experience economic losses and increased volatility in its earnings which could adversely impact the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. The cost of any/uni00A0guarantees that remain unhedged will also affect Jackson's results.\n\nPeriods of significant and sustained downturns in securities markets, increased equity volatility, reduced interest rates, or deviations in/uni00A0expected policyholder behaviour could also increase the cost of/uni00A0hedging beyond that anticipated in the pricing of the products being/uni00A0hedged and could produce losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed.\n\nIn addition, Jackson hedges the guarantees on its variable annuity book on an economic basis (with consideration of the local regulatory position) and, thus, accepts variability in its accounting results in the short term in order to achieve the appropriate result on these bases. In/uni00A0particular, for Prudential's Group International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') reporting, the measurement of the Jackson variable annuity guarantees is typically less sensitive to market movements than for the corresponding hedging derivatives, which are held at market value. However, depending on the level of hedging conducted regarding a particular risk type, certain market movements can drive volatility in the economic or local regulatory results that may be less significant under IFRS reporting.\n\nAlso, Jackson has a mix of spread-based and mortality business with assets invested in fixed-income securities and its results are therefore affected by fluctuations in prevailing interest rates. In particular, stable value products written by Jackson expose Prudential to the risk that changes in interest rates, which are not fully reflected in the interest rates credited to customers, will reduce spread. The spread is the difference between the rate of return Jackson is able to earn on the assets backing the policyholders' liabilities and the amounts that are credited to policyholders in the form of benefit increases, subject to minimum crediting rates. Declines in spread from these products or other spread businesses that Jackson conducts, and increases in surrender levels arising from interest rate rises, could have a material impact on its businesses or results of operations.\n\nAny of the foregoing factors and events, individually or together, could/uni00A0have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n- 1.3 As a holding company, Prudential is dependent upon its subsidiaries to cover operating expenses and dividend payments The Group's insurance and investment management operations are generally conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries, which are subject to the risks discussed elsewhere in this 'Risk Factors' section.\n\nAs a holding company, Prudential's principal sources of funds are remittances from subsidiaries, shareholder-backed funds, the shareholder transfer from long-term funds and any amounts that may be raised through the issuance of equity, debt and commercial paper.\n\nCertain of Prudential's subsidiaries are subject to applicable insurance, foreign exchange and tax laws, rules and regulations (including in relation to distributable profits) that can limit their ability to make remittances. In some circumstances, including where there are changes to general market conditions, this could limit Prudential's ability to pay dividends to shareholders or to make available funds held in certain subsidiaries to cover operating expenses of other members of the Group.\n\nA material change in the financial condition of any of Prudential's subsidiaries may have a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

Recent shifts in the focus of some national governments toward more protectionist or restrictive economic and trade policies with specific markets, and international trade disputes, could impact on the macroeconomic outlook and the environment for global financial markets. This could take effect, for example, through increased friction in cross-border trade, such as implementation of trade tariffs or the withdrawal from existing trading blocs or agreements and the exercise of executive powers to restrict overseas trade, financial transactions, capital movements and/or investment. The degree and nature of regulatory changes and Prudential's competitive position in some geographic markets may also/uni00A0be impacted, for example, through measures favouring local enterprises, such as changes to the maximum level of non-domestic ownership by foreign companies or differing treatment under regulations and tax rules.\n\n(Geo)political risks and political uncertainty may also adversely impact the Group's operations and its operational resilience. Increased (geo) political tensions may increase cross-border cyber activity and therefore increase cyber security risks. (Geo)political tensions may/uni00A0also lead to civil unrest and/or acts of civil disobedience. This/uni00A0includes the unrest in Hong Kong, where mass anti-government demonstrations have given rise to increased disruption throughout the region. Such events could impact operational resilience by disrupting Prudential's systems, operations, new business sales and renewals, distribution channels and services to customers, which may result in a reduction in contributions from business units to the central cash balances and profit of the Group, decreased profitability, financial loss, adverse customer impacts and reputational damage and may impact Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and/uni00A0prospects.\n\nResponses by the US, UK and other governments to the enactment and application of the national security law in Hong Kong and other constitutional or legislative changes in the territory, which continue to develop, may adversely impact Hong Kong's economy with potential adverse sales, operational and product distribution impacts to the Group due to the territory being a key market which also hosts regional and head office functions. For internationally active groups such as Prudential, operating across multiple jurisdictions, government measures and responses may also add to the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance and increase the risk of conflicts between the requirements of one jurisdiction and another. See risk factor 3.1 below.\n\n## 1.5 Prudential is subject to the risk of potential sovereign debt credit deterioration owing to the amounts of sovereign debt obligations held in its investment portfolio\n\nInvesting in sovereign debt creates exposure to the direct or indirect consequences of political, social or economic changes (including changes in governments, heads of state or monarchs) in the countries in which the issuers of such debt are located and to the creditworthiness of the sovereign. Investment in sovereign debt obligations involves risks not present in debt obligations of corporate issuers. In addition, the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or pay interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt, and Prudential may have limited recourse to compel payment in the event of/uni00A0a default. A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal and to pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, its relations with its central bank, the extent of its foreign currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole, the sovereign debtor's policy toward local and international lenders, and the political constraints to which the sovereign debtor may be subject.\n\nMoreover, governments may use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by their central banks or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes, to devalue their currencies' exchange rates, or may adopt monetary and other policies (including to manage their debt burdens) that have a similar effect, all of which could adversely impact the value of an investment in sovereign debt even in the absence of a technical default. Periods of economic uncertainty may affect the volatility of market prices of sovereign debt to a greater extent than the volatility inherent in debt obligations of other types of issuers.\n\nIn addition, if a sovereign default or other such events described above were to occur as has happened on occasion in the past, other financial institutions may also suffer losses or experience solvency or other concerns, which may result in Prudential facing additional risks relating to investments in such financial institutions that are held in the Group's investment portfolio. There is also risk that public perceptions about the stability and creditworthiness of financial institutions and the financial sector generally might be adversely affected, as might counterparty relationships between financial institutions.\n\nIf a sovereign were to default on its obligations, or adopt policies that devalued or otherwise altered the currencies in which its obligations were denominated, this could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and/uni00A0prospects.",

Downgrades in Prudential's ratings as a result of, for example, decreased profitability, increased costs, increased indebtedness or other concerns could have an adverse effect on its ability to market products, retain current policyholders, and the Group's ability to compete for acquisition and strategic opportunities. Downgrades may also impact the Group's financial flexibility, including its ability to issue commercial paper at current levels and pricing. The interest rates at which Prudential is able to borrow funds are affected by its credit ratings, which are in place to measure the Group's ability to meet its contractual obligations.\n\nIn addition, changes in methodologies and criteria used by rating agencies could result in downgrades that do not reflect changes in the/uni00A0general economic conditions or Prudential's financial condition.\n\nAny such downgrades could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Prudential cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions Prudential may therefore take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect its business.\n\n## 1.7 Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations owing to the geographical diversity of its businesses\n\nDue to the geographical diversity of Prudential's businesses, Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Prudential's operations generally write policies and invest in assets denominated in local currencies. Although this practice limits the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on local operating results, it can lead to fluctuations in Prudential's consolidated financial statements upon the translation of results into the Group's presentation currency. This exposure is not currently separately managed. The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars, which is the currency in which a large proportion of the Group's earnings and assets and liabilities are denominated or to which they are linked (such as the Hong Kong dollar). There remain some entities within the Group the results of which are not denominated in or linked to the US dollar and transactions which are conducted in non-US dollar currencies. Prudential is subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations from the translation of the results of these entities and transactions and the risks from the maintenance of the Hong Kong dollar peg to the US dollar.\n\n## 2. Risks relating to Prudential's business activities and industry\n\n## 2.1 The proposed demerger of Jackson carries with it execution\n\n## risk and will require significant management attention\n\nThe proposed demerger of Jackson is subject to a number of factors and dependencies, such as prevailing market and political conditions and external approvals (including those from regulators and shareholders). In addition, preparing for and implementing the proposed demerger of Jackson is expected to require significant time from management, and management time will continue to be required in respect of any future sale of Prudential's remaining stake in Jackson. Management's attention may be diverted from other aspects of Prudential's business as a result.\n\nTherefore, there can be no certainty that the demerger of Jackson will be implemented on the anticipated timetable, or that it will be completed as proposed (or at all). Further, if the proposed demerger of Jackson is completed, there can be no assurance that either Prudential or Jackson will realise the anticipated benefits of the transaction, or that the proposed demerger of Jackson and/or the future sale of Prudential's remaining stake in Jackson will not adversely affect the trading value or/uni00A0liquidity of the shares of either or both of the two businesses.\n\nIf the demerger of Jackson does complete, Prudential will continue to/uni00A0hold shares in Jackson. The market price of Jackson shares may be volatile and can go down as well as up. It is therefore possible that the value of Prudential's shareholding may be lower than anticipated, and the gross proceeds due to Prudential from any future sale may be lower than Prudential might otherwise achieve.\n\nFailure to complete the demerger of Jackson would result in the potential benefits of the separation not being realised and may have an/uni00A0adverse effect on the reputation of Prudential and on the external perception of its ability to implement large-scale projects successfully. This may be the case even where the failure to implement the demerger of Jackson is due to factors outside the control of Prudential. A failure to/uni00A0complete the demerger of Jackson may also result in increased regulatory scrutiny on Prudential, in particular where the reasons for the demerger of Jackson not proceeding are internal to/uni00A0Prudential.\n\n## 2.2 The implementation of large-scale transformation, including\n\ncomplex strategic initiatives, gives rise to significant design and execution risks, may affect Prudential's operational capability and capacity, and may adversely impact the Group and the delivery of/uni00A0its strategy if these initiatives fail to meet their objectives In order to implement its business strategies for growth, improve customer experiences, strengthen operational resilience, meet regulatory and industry requirements and maintain market competitiveness, Prudential undertakes Group restructuring, largescale transformation and acquisitions and disposals across its business. Many of these change initiatives are complex, interconnected and/or of large scale, including a current focus on preparations for the proposed demerger of Jackson, advancing the Group's digital capability, expanding strategic partnerships and industry and regulatory-driven change. There may be a material adverse effect to Prudential's business, customers, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if these initiatives incur unplanned costs, are subject to implementation delays, or fail to fully meet their objectives. Additionally, there may be adverse non-financial (including operational, regulatory, conduct and reputational) implications for the Group. These initiatives inherently give rise to design and execution risks, and may increase existing business risks, such as placing additional strain on the operational capacity, or weakening the control environment, of the Group.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "Implementing further initiatives related to significant regulatory changes, such as IFRS 17 and the transition to a legislative framework in Hong Kong for the Group-wide supervision of insurance groups, may amplify these risks. Risks relating to these regulatory changes are/uni00A0explained in the 'Legal and Regulatory Risk' risk factor below.\n\nThe speed of technological change in the business could outpace the/uni00A0Group's ability to anticipate all the unintended consequences that may arise from such change. Innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, expose Prudential to potential information security, operational, ethical and conduct risks which, if improperly managed, could result in customer detriment and reputational damage.\n\n## 2.3 Prudential's businesses are conducted in highly competitive environments with developing demographic trends and continued profitability depends upon management's ability to respond to these pressures and trends\n\nThe markets for financial services in the US and Asia are highly competitive, with several factors affecting Prudential's ability to sell its/uni00A0products and continued profitability, including price and yields offered, financial strength and ratings, range of product lines and product quality, brand strength and name recognition, investment management performance and fund management trends, historical bonus levels, the ability to respond to developing demographic trends, customer appetite for certain savings products and technological advances. In some of its markets, Prudential faces competitors that are/uni00A0larger, have greater financial resources or a greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher bonus rates. Further, heightened competition for talented and skilled employees, agents and independent financial advisers may limit Prudential's potential to grow its business as quickly as planned. Technological advances, including the increased capability for gathering large volumes of customer health data and developments in capabilities and tools in analysing and interpreting such data (such as artificial intelligence and machine learning), may result in increased competition to the Group, both from within and outside the insurance industry, and may increase the competition risks resulting from a failure to be able to attract sufficient numbers of skilled staff.\n\nIn Asia, the Group's principal competitors include global life insurers together with regional insurers and multinational asset managers. In most Asia markets, there are also local companies that have a material market presence.\n\nJackson's competitors in the US include major stock and mutual insurance companies, mutual fund organisations, banks and other financial services companies.\n\nPrudential believes that competition will intensify across all regions in/uni00A0response to consumer demand, digital and other technological advances (including the emergence of new distribution channels), the/uni00A0need for economies of scale and the consequential impact of consolidation, regulatory actions and other factors. Prudential's ability/uni00A0to generate an appropriate return depends significantly upon its capacity to anticipate and respond appropriately to these competitive pressures. This includes managing the potential adverse impacts to the/uni00A0commercial value of the Group's existing sale and distribution arrangements, such as bancassurance arrangements, in markets where new distribution channels develop.\n\nFailure to do so may negatively impact Prudential's ability to attract and retain customers and, importantly, may limit Prudential's ability to take advantage of new business arising in the markets in which it operates, which may have an adverse interest on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## 2.4 Adverse experience in the operational risks inherent in Prudential's business, and those of its material outsourcing partners, could disrupt its business functions and have a negative impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects\n\nOperational risks are present in all of Prudential's businesses, including the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal and external processes, systems or human error, fraud, the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events (such as natural disasters, pandemics, cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, civil unrest and other catastrophes) or from other external events. These risks may also adversely impact Prudential through its partners which provide bancassurance and product distribution, outsourcing, external technology, data hosting and other services.\n\nExposure to such events could impact Prudential's operational resilience and ability to perform necessary business functions by disrupting its systems, operations, new business sales and renewals, distribution channels and services to customers, or result in the loss of/uni00A0confidential or proprietary data. Such events, as well as any weaknesses in administration systems (such as those relating to policyholder records) or actuarial reserving processes, may also result/uni00A0in increased expenses, as well as legal and regulatory sanctions, decreased profitability, financial loss, customer conduct risk impacts and may damage Prudential's reputation and relationship with its customers and business partners.\n\nPrudential's business is dependent on processing a large number of/uni00A0transactions for numerous and diverse products. It also employs a large number of complex and interconnected IT and finance systems and models, and user developed applications in its processes to perform a range of operational functions including the calculation of/uni00A0regulatory or internal capital requirements, the valuation of assets and liabilities, determining hedging requirements, and in acquiring new business using artificial intelligence and digital applications. Some/uni00A0of these tools form an integral part of the information and decision-making framework of Prudential and the risk of adverse consequences arising from erroneous or misinterpreted tools used in/uni00A0core business activities, decision making and reporting exists. Errors/uni00A0or/uni00A0limitations in these tools, or inappropriate usage, may lead to/uni00A0regulatory breaches, inappropriate decision-making, financial loss, or/uni00A0reputational damage. The long-term nature of much of the Group's business also means that accurate records have to be maintained securely for significant time periods. Further, Prudential operates in an extensive and evolving legal and regulatory environment (including in relation to tax) which adds to the complexity of the governance and operation of its business processes and controls.\n\nThe performance of the Group's core business activities and the uninterrupted availability of services to customers rely significantly on,/uni00A0and require significant investment in, IT infrastructure and security, system development, data governance and management, compliance and other operational systems, personnel, controls and processes. During times of significant change, the resilience and operational effectiveness of these systems and processes at Prudential and/or its/uni00A0third party providers may be adversely impacted. In particular, Prudential and its business partners are making increasing use of emerging technological tools and digital services, or forming strategic partnerships with third parties to provide these capabilities. Automated distribution channels to customers increase the criticality of providing uninterrupted services. A failure to implement appropriate governance and management of the incremental operational risks from emerging technologies may adversely impact Prudential's reputation and brand, the results of its operations, its ability to attract and retain customers and/uni00A0its ability to deliver on its long-term strategy and therefore its competitiveness and long-term financial success.",

        "page_content": "Although Prudential's IT, compliance and other operational systems, models and processes incorporate governance and controls designed to manage and mitigate the operational and model risks associated with its activities, there can be no assurance as to the resilience of these systems and processes to disruption or that governance and controls will always be effective. Due to human error, among other reasons, operational and model risk incidents do occur from time to time and no system or process can entirely prevent them, although Prudential has not, to date, identified any such incidents that have had a material impact. Prudential's legacy and other IT systems, data and processes, as with operational systems and processes generally, may/uni00A0also be susceptible to failure or security/data breaches.\n\nIn addition, Prudential relies on the performance and operations of a number of bancassurance, outsourcing (including external technology and data hosting) and service partners. These include back office support functions, such as those relating to IT infrastructure, development and support and customer facing operations and services, such as product distribution and services (including through digital channels) and investment operations. This creates reliance upon the resilient operational performance of these partners, and failure to adequately oversee the partner, or the failure of a partner (or of its IT and operational systems and processes) could result in significant disruption to business operations and customers, may have reputational or conduct risk implications and which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## 2.5 Attempts to access or disrupt Prudential's IT systems, and loss/uni00A0or misuse of personal data, could result in loss of trust from Prudential's customers and employees, reputational damage and have material adverse effects on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects\n\nPrudential and its business partners are increasingly exposed to the/uni00A0risk that individuals (which includes connected persons such as/uni00A0employees, contractors or representatives of Prudential or its/uni00A0third-party service providers, and unconnected persons) or groups/uni00A0may intentionally or unintentionally disrupt the availability, confidentiality and integrity of its IT systems or compromise the integrity and security of data (both corporate and customer), which could result in disruption to key operations, make it difficult to recover critical services or damage assets, any of which could result in loss of/uni00A0trust from Prudential's customers and employees, reputational damage and direct or indirect financial loss. The cyber-security threat/uni00A0continues to evolve globally in sophistication and potential significance. Prudential's increasing profile in its current markets and those in which it is entering, growing customer interest in interacting with their insurance providers and asset managers through the internet and social media, improved brand awareness and the 2016 designation of Prudential as a G-SII could also increase the likelihood of/uni00A0Prudential being considered a target by cyber criminals. Further, there have been changes to the threat landscape in recent years and/uni00A0the risk from untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks/uni00A0has increased.\n\nThere is an increasing requirement and expectation on Prudential and/uni00A0its business partners to not only hold customer, shareholder and/uni00A0employee data securely, but also to ensure its ongoing accuracy and that it is being used in a transparent, appropriate and ethical way,/uni00A0including in decision-making where automated processes are employed. A failure to do so may result in regulatory scrutiny and sanctions and may adversely impact the reputation and brand of the Group, its ability to attract and retain customers, its ability to deliver on/uni00A0its long-term strategy and therefore the results of its operations. New and currently unforeseeable regulatory issues may also arise from/uni00A0the increased use of emerging technology.\n\nThe risk to the Group of not meeting these requirements and\n\nexpectations may be increased by the development and usage of digital distribution and service channels, which can collect a broader range of personal and health-related data from individuals at increased scale, and the use of complex tools, machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to process, analyse and interpret this data. Regulatory developments in data protection worldwide (such as the implementation of EU General Data Protection Regulation that came into force in 2018 and the California Consumer Protection Act that came into force on 1 January 2020) may also increase the financial and reputational implications for Prudential following a significant breach of its (or its third-party suppliers') IT systems or data. The international transfer of data may, as a global organisation, increase regulatory risks for the Group. Although Prudential has experienced or has been affected by cyber and data breaches, to date, it has not identified a failure or breach, or an incident of data misuse in relation to its legacy and other IT systems and processes which has had a material impact. However, Prudential has been, and likely will continue to be, subject to/uni00A0potential damage from computer viruses, unauthorised access and cyber-security attacks such as 'denial of service' attacks (which, for example, can cause temporary disruption to websites and IT networks), phishing and disruptive software campaigns.\n\nPrudential is continually enhancing its IT environment to remain secure against emerging threats, together with increasing its ability to detect system compromise and recover should such an incident occur. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not take place which may have material adverse consequential effects on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and/uni00A0prospects.\n\n## 2.6 Prudential's digital health application, Pulse, has seen increasing adoption in Asia and as the markets in which it operates,/uni00A0its user base, features, partnerships and product offerings develop, existing business risks to the Group may be/uni00A0increased and new risks may be introduced\n\nPrudential's digital health application, Pulse, is subject to the risks discussed within this 'Risk Factors' section. In particular, these include risks related to legal and regulatory compliance and the conduct of business; the execution of complex change initiatives; information security, cyber and data privacy; the use of models (including those using artificial intelligence) and personal data; the resilience and integrity of IT infrastructure and operations; and those related to the management of third parties. These existing risks for the Group may be/uni00A0increased due to a number of factors:\n\n- -The number of current and planned markets in which the application operates, each with their own laws and regulations, regulatory and supervisory authorities, may increase regulatory compliance risks.\n- -The implementation of planned application features and offerings may require the delivery of complex, inter-connected change initiatives across current and planned markets. This may give rise to/uni00A0design and execution risks, which could be amplified where these change initiatives are delivered concurrently.\n- -The increased volume, breadth and sensitivity of data on which the business model of the application is dependent and to which the Group has access, holds, analyses and processes through its models, which increases data security, privacy and usage risks. The/uni00A0use of complex models, including where they use artificial intelligence for critical decision-making, in the application's features and offerings may give rise to operational, conduct, litigation and reputational risks where they do not function as intended.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

This/uni00A0may increase operational disruption risks to the uninterrupted provision of services to customers, regulatory compliance and conduct risks, and the potential for reputational risks.\n\nNew product offerings may be developed and provided through the/uni00A0application, some of which Prudential may have limited or no experience in providing, which may introduce new regulatory, operational, conduct and strategic risks for Group.\n\nA failure to implement appropriate governance and management of/uni00A0the incremental and new risks detailed above may adversely impact/uni00A0Prudential's reputation and brand, its ability to attract and/uni00A0retain customers, its competitiveness and its ability to deliver on/uni00A0its/uni00A0long-term strategy.\n\n## 2.7 Prudential operates in certain markets with joint venture partners, minority shareholders and other third parties, resulting in certain risks that Prudential does not face with respect to its/uni00A0wholly-owned subsidiaries\n\nPrudential operates, and in certain markets is required by local regulation to operate, through joint ventures and other joint ownership or third-party arrangements. For such Group operations the level of/uni00A0control exercisable by the Group depends on the terms of the contractual agreements, in particular, those terms providing for the allocation of control among, and continued cooperation between, the participants. In addition, the level of control exercisable by the Group could be subject to changes in the maximum level of non-domestic ownership imposed on foreign companies in certain jurisdictions.\n\nPrudential may face financial, reputational and other exposure (including regulatory censure) in the event that any of its partners fails/uni00A0or is unable to meet its obligations under the arrangements, encounters financial difficulty, or fails to comply with local or international regulation and standards such as those pertaining to the prevention of financial crime. In addition, a significant proportion of the Group's product distribution is carried out through arrangements with third parties not controlled by Prudential such as bancassurance and agency arrangements in Asia and broker-dealer networks in the US and is therefore dependent upon continuation of these relationships. A/uni00A0temporary or permanent disruption to these distribution arrangements, such as through significant deterioration in the reputation, financial position or other circumstances of the third party, material failure in controls (such as those pertaining to the third-party system failure or the prevention of financial crime) or failure to meet/uni00A0any regulatory requirements could adversely affect Prudential's/uni00A0reputation and its business, financial condition, results/uni00A0of/uni00A0operations and prospects.\n\n## 2.8 Adverse experience relative to the assumptions used in pricing products and reporting business results could significantly affect Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and/uni00A0prospects\n\nIn common with other life insurers, the profitability of the Group's businesses depends on a mix of factors including mortality and morbidity levels and trends, policy surrenders and take-up rates on/uni00A0guarantee features of products, investment performance and impairments, unit cost of administration and new business acquisition expenses. The Group's businesses are subject to inflation risk. In particular, the Group's medical insurance businesses in Asia are also/uni00A0exposed to medical inflation risk.\n\nPrudential needs to make assumptions about a number of factors in determining the pricing of its products, for setting reserves, and for reporting its capital levels and the results of its long-term business operations.\n\nAssumptions about future expected levels of mortality are of relevance to the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit ('GMWB') of Jackson's variable annuity business.\n\nA further factor is the assumption that Prudential makes about future expected levels of the rates of early termination of products by its customers (known as persistency). This is relevant to a number of lines of business in the Group, especially for Jackson's portfolio of variable annuities and across product lines in Asian markets. Prudential's persistency assumptions reflect a combination of recent past experience for each relevant line of business and expert judgement, especially where a lack of relevant and credible experience data exists. Any expected change in future persistency is also reflected in the assumption. If actual levels of future persistency are significantly different than assumed, the Group's results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, Jackson's variable annuity products are sensitive to other types of policyholder behaviour, such as the takeup of its GMWB product features.\n\nIn addition, Prudential's business may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics and other effects that give rise to a large number of deaths or additional sickness claims, as well as increases to/uni00A0the cost of medical claims. Pandemics, significant influenza and other epidemics have occurred a number of times historically but the likelihood, timing, or the severity of future events cannot be predicted. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and nongovernmental organisations, in combating the spread and severity of any epidemics could have a material impact on the Group's claims experience. The risks to the Group resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic are included in the 'Covid-19' risk factor detailed in above.\n\nPrudential uses reinsurance to selectively transfer mortality, morbidity and other risks. This exposes the Group to the counterparty risk of a reinsurer being unable to pay reinsurance claims or otherwise meet their commitments; the risk that a reinsurer changes reinsurance terms and conditions of coverage, or increases the price of reinsurance which Prudential is unable to pass on to its customers; and the risk of/uni00A0ambiguity in the reinsurance terms and conditions leading to uncertainty whether an event is covered under a reinsurance contract.\n\nAny of the foregoing, individually or together, could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of/uni00A0operations and prospects.",

        "page_content": "## 2.9 Prudential is exposed to ongoing risks as a result of/uni00A0the/uni00A0demerger of M&G plc (the 'M&G Demerger')\n\nOn 21 October 2019, Prudential completed the M&G Demerger and, in connection with this, Prudential entered into a demerger agreement with M&G plc. Among other provisions, the demerger agreement contains a customary indemnity under which Prudential has agreed to indemnify M&G plc against liabilities incurred by the M&G plc group that relate to the business of the Group. Although it is not anticipated that Prudential will be required to pay any substantial amount pursuant to such indemnity obligations, if any amount payable thereunder is substantial this could have a material adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## 3. Legal and regulatory risk\n\n3.1  Prudential conducts its businesses subject to regulation and associated regulatory risks, including a change to the basis in the regulatory supervision of the Group, the effects of changes in the laws, regulations, policies and interpretations and any accounting standards in the markets in which it operates\n\nChanges in government policy and legislation (including in relation to tax), capital control measures on companies and individuals, regulation or regulatory interpretation applying to companies in the financial services and insurance industries in any of the markets in which Prudential operates (including those related to the conduct of business by Prudential or its third party distributors), or decisions taken by regulators in connection with their supervision of members of the Group, which in some circumstances may be applied retrospectively, may adversely affect Prudential. The impact from any regulatory changes may be material to Prudential, for example changes may be required to its product range, distribution channels, handling and usage of data, competitiveness, profitability, capital requirements, risk management approaches, corporate or governance structure and, consequently, reported results and financing requirements. Also, regulators in jurisdictions in which Prudential operates may impose requirements affecting the allocation of capital and liquidity between different business units in the Group, whether on a geographic, legal entity, product line or other basis. Regulators may also change solvency requirements, methodologies for determining components of the regulatory or statutory balance sheet including the reserves and the level of capital required to be held by individual businesses (with implications to the Group capital position), the regulation of selling practices, and could introduce changes that impact products sold or that may be sold. Furthermore, as a result of interventions by governments in light of financial and global economic conditions, there may continue to be changes in government regulation and supervision of the financial services industry, including the possibility of higher capital requirements, restrictions on certain types of transactions and/uni00A0enhancement of supervisory powers.\n\nIn the markets in which it operates, Prudential is subject to regulatory requirements and obligations with respect to financial crime including anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, which may either impose obligations on the Group to act in a certain manner or restrict the way that it can act in respect of specified individuals, organisations, businesses and/or governments. A failure to do so may adversely impact the reputation of Prudential and/or result in the imposition of legal or regulatory sanctions for the Group. For internationally active groups such as Prudential, operating across multiple jurisdictions increases the complexity of legal and regulatory compliance. Compliance with Prudential's legal or regulatory obligations in one jurisdiction may conflict with the law or policy objectives of another jurisdiction, or may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives/uni00A0of that jurisdiction over another, creating additional legal,/uni00A0regulatory compliance and reputational risks for the Group. These risks may be increased where uncertainty exists on the scope/uni00A0of/uni00A0regulatory requirements and obligations, and where the/uni00A0complexity of specific cases applicable to the Group is high.\n\nFollowing the demerger of Jackson, these risks may become more pronounced for the Group as markets with higher geopolitical risk exposure will form a larger proportion of Prudential's operations.\n\nFurther information on specific areas of regulatory and supervisory requirements and changes are included in the sub-sections below.\n\n## (a) Group-wide Supervision\n\nWith effect from 21 October 2019, the Group-wide supervisor of Prudential plc changed to the Hong Kong Insurance Authority ('IA'). To/uni00A0align Hong Kong's regulatory regime with international standards and practices, the Hong Kong IA has developed a new Group-wide Supervision ('GWS') Framework for multinational insurance groups under its supervision. The GWS Framework is based on a principlebased and outcome-focused approach, and allows the Hong Kong IA/uni00A0to exercise direct regulatory powers over the designated holding companies of multinational insurance groups. On 24 July 2020 the Insurance (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance, being the enabling primary legislation providing for the GWS Framework, was enacted. This primary legislation is supported by subsidiary legislation and guidance material from the Hong Kong IA. The relevant subsidiary legislation, including the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules, was tabled before the Legislative Council on 6 January 2021 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021. The GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021, subject to transitional arrangements. Prior to/uni00A0the GWS Framework becoming effective for the Group, Prudential remains subject to the Regulatory Letter signed with the Hong Kong IA. This letter outlines the interim supervision arrangements from 21 October 2019 when the Hong Kong IA became the Group-wide supervisor of the Group.\n\nAlthough the GWS Framework is broadly consistent with the interim supervision arrangements that currently apply to the Group under the/uni00A0Regulatory Letter, until all elements of the GWS Framework are/uni00A0finalised the Group cannot be certain of the nature and extent of/uni00A0differences between the interim principles agreed with the Hong/uni00A0Kong IA and the specific regulatory requirements of the GWS Framework. The Group's existing processes and resources may also need to change to comply with the final GWS Framework or any other requirements of the Hong Kong IA. The need to adapt to any such changes or to respond to any such requirements may lead to increased costs or otherwise impact the business, financial condition, results, profitability and/or prospects of the Group.\n\nWith the agreement of the Hong Kong IA, Prudential currently applies/uni00A0the Local Capital Summation Method (the 'LCSM') to determine Group regulatory capital requirements under the Regulatory Letter. Prudential currently expects the GWS methodology to be largely consistent with these interim supervisory requirements, with the exception of the treatment of debt instruments outlined below/uni00A0which will be subject to transitional arrangements under the GWS Framework, however any differences in the final requirements adopted under the GWS Framework may lead to changes to the way in/uni00A0which capital requirements are calculated and to the eligibility of/uni00A0the/uni00A0capital instruments issued by Prudential to satisfy such capital/uni00A0requirements.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "The Hong Kong IA has agreed that the subordinated debt instruments issued by Prudential at the date of the demerger of M&G plc can be included as part of the Group's capital resources for the purposes of/uni00A0satisfying the capital requirements imposed under the interim LCSM/uni00A0principles agreed with the Hong Kong IA. Senior debt instruments issued by Prudential are not included as part of the Group/uni00A0capital resources under the LCSM. Under the GWS Framework, Prudential's initial analysis indicates that all debt instruments (senior and subordinated) issued by Prudential will meet/uni00A0the transitional conditions set by the Hong Kong IA and will be/uni00A0included as eligible Group capital resources, although this will be/uni00A0subject to approval by the Hong Kong IA. If the Hong Kong IA does not approve the subordinated debt instruments Prudential has in issue as part of the Group's eligible capital resources for the purposes of/uni00A0satisfying the capital requirements imposed under the GWS Framework, Prudential may have less eligible capital resources compared to under the LCSM and may need to raise additional debt instruments, which may in turn lead to increased costs for the Group.\n\n## (b) Global regulatory requirements and systematic risk regulation\n\nCurrently there are also a number of other global regulatory developments which could impact Prudential's businesses in the many/uni00A0jurisdictions in which they operate. These include the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ('Dodd-Frank Act') and its subsequent amendments in the US which provided for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the US including reforms to financial services entities, products and markets, the work of the Financial Stability Board (the 'FSB') in the area of systemic risk including the reassessment of the designation of Global Systemically Important Insurers ('G-SIIs'), and the Insurance Capital Standard (the 'ICS') being developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the 'IAIS'). In addition, regulators in a number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates are further developing their local capital regimes. Across Asia this includes China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and India. There remains a high degree of uncertainty over the potential impact of such changes on the Group.\n\nIn November 2019 the IAIS adopted the Common Framework ('ComFrame') which establishes supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the effective group-wide supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups ('IAIGs'). The ComFrame proposals, which include the ICS, could result in enhanced capital and regulatory measures for IAIGs. Prudential was included in the first register of IAIGs released by the IAIS on 1 July 2020 and was designated an IAIG by the Hong Kong IA following an assessment against the established criteria in ComFrame.\n\nIn November 2019 the FSB endorsed a new Holistic Framework ('HF'), intended for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector, for implementation by the IAIS in 2020 and has suspended G-SII designations until completion of a review to be undertaken in 2022. Many of the previous G-SII measures have already been adopted into the Insurance Core Principles ('ICPs') and ComFrame. As an IAIG, Prudential is expected to be subject to these measures. The HF also includes a monitoring element for the identification of a build-up of systemic risk and to enable supervisors to take action where appropriate. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, this monitoring requirement has been replaced with a Covid-19-focused exercise for 2020, with annual monitoring expected to recommence in 2021. In November 2020 the IAIS launched a public consultation on phase 1 of/uni00A0a/uni00A0proposed liquidity metric to be used as an ancillary indicator in/uni00A0the/uni00A0monitoring of the build-up of systemic risk. This followed a/uni00A0more/uni00A0general consultation on liquidity metrics earlier in 2020.\n\nConsultations on a phase 2 liquidity metric, as well as on macroeconomic elements of the HF, are expected to follow. The FSB published its 2020 Resolution Report in November 2020, highlighting intra-group connectedness and funding in resolution as key areas of attention for its work on resolution planning. Resolution will continue to be a near term focus in the FSB's financial stability work and may inform decisions around the reformed G-SII designation in 2022.\n\nThe IAIS continues to develop the ICS as part of ComFrame. The/uni00A0implementation of ICS will be conducted in two phases a/uni00A0five-year monitoring phase followed by an implementation phase.\n\n## (c) IFRS 17\n\nThe Group's accounts are prepared in accordance with current IFRS applicable to the insurance industry. The International Accounting Standards Board (the 'IASB') introduced a framework that it described as Phase I which, under its standard IFRS 4, permitted insurers to continue to use the statutory basis of accounting for insurance assets and liabilities that existed in their jurisdictions prior to January 2005. In/uni00A0May 2017, the IASB published its replacement standard on insurance accounting (IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts'). Some targeted amendments to this standard, including to the effective date, were issued in June 2020. IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts', as amended, will have the effect of introducing fundamental changes to the statutory reporting of insurance entities that prepare accounts according to IFRS/uni00A0from 2023. The standard is subject to endorsement in the UK via/uni00A0the UK Endorsement Board which is currently being established. Prudential has a Group-wide implementation programme underway to/uni00A0implement this new standard. The effect of changes required to the/uni00A0Group's accounting policies as a result of implementing the new standard is currently uncertain particularly as amendments were issued by the IASB in June 2020, but these changes can be expected to, amongst other things, alter the timing of IFRS profit recognition. The implementation of this standard will involve significant enhancements to IT, actuarial and finance systems of the Group.\n\nAny changes or modification of IFRS accounting policies may require a change in the way in which future results will be determined and/or a retrospective adjustment of reported results to ensure consistency.\n\n## (d) Inter-bank offered rate ('IBOR') reforms\n\nIn July 2014, the FSB announced widespread reforms to address the integrity and reliability of IBORs. The discontinuation of IBORs in their current form and their replacement with alternative risk-free reference rates such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average benchmark ('SONIA') in the UK and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') in the US could, among other things, impact the Group through an adverse effect on the value of Prudential's assets and liabilities which are linked to or which reference IBORs, a reduction in/uni00A0market liquidity during any period of transition and increased legal and conduct risks to the Group arising from changes required to documentation and its related obligations to its stakeholders.\n\n## (e) Investor contribution schemes\n\nVarious jurisdictions in which Prudential operates have created investor compensation schemes that require mandatory contributions from market participants in some instances in the event of a failure of a market participant. As a major participant in the majority of its chosen markets, circumstances could arise in which Prudential, along with other companies, may be required to make such contributions.",

Such actions relate, and/uni00A0could in the future relate, to the application of current regulations or the failure to implement new regulations (including those relating to/uni00A0the conduct of business), regulatory reviews of broader industry practices and products sold (including in relation to lines of business already closed) in the past under acceptable industry or market practices at the time and changes to the tax regime affecting products. Regulators may also focus on the approach that product providers use to select third-party distributors and to monitor the appropriateness of/uni00A0sales made by them. In some cases, product providers can be held responsible for the deficiencies of third-party distributors.\n\nIn the US, there has been significant attention on the different regulatory standards applied to investment advice delivered to retail customers by/uni00A0different sectors of the industry. As a result of reports relating to perceptions of industry abuses, there have been numerous regulatory inquiries and proposals for legislative and regulatory reforms. This includes focus on the suitability of sales of certain products, alternative investments and the widening of the circumstances under which a person or entity providing investment advice with respect to certain employee benefit and pension plans would be considered a fiduciary subjecting the person or entity to certain regulatory requirements. There/uni00A0is a risk that new regulations introduced may have a material adverse effect on the sales of the products by Prudential and increase Prudential's exposure to legal/uni00A0risks.\n\nAny regulatory action arising out of the Group's position as a product provider could have an adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or otherwise harm its reputation.\n\n## 3.3 Litigation, disputes and regulatory investigations may adversely affect Prudential's business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects\n\nPrudential is, and may in the future be, subject to legal actions, disputes and regulatory investigations in various contexts, including in/uni00A0the ordinary course of its insurance, investment management and/uni00A0other business operations. These legal actions, disputes and investigations may relate to aspects of Prudential's businesses and operations that are specific to Prudential, or that are common to companies that operate in Prudential's markets. Legal actions and disputes may arise under contracts, regulations (including tax) or from/uni00A0a course of conduct taken by Prudential, and may be class actions. Although Prudential believes that it has adequately provided in all material respects for the costs of litigation and regulatory matters, no assurance can be provided that such provisions are sufficient. Given/uni00A0the large or indeterminate amounts of damages sometimes sought, other sanctions that might be imposed and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes, it is possible that an adverse/uni00A0outcome could have an adverse effect on Prudential's business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/uni00A0prospects.\n\n## 3.4 Changes in tax legislation may result in adverse tax consequences for the Group's business, financial condition, results/uni00A0of operations and prospects\n\nTax rules, including those relating to the insurance industry, and their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect, in any of the jurisdictions in which Prudential operates. Significant tax disputes with tax authorities, and any change in the tax status of any member of the Group or in taxation legislation or its scope or interpretation could affect Prudential's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## 4. Environmental, social and governance risks\n\n## 4.1 The failure to understand and respond effectively to the risks associated with environmental, social or governance ('ESG') factors could adversely affect Prudential's achievement of/uni00A0its/uni00A0long-term strategy\n\nThe purpose of a business and the way in which it operates in achieving its objectives, including in relation to ESG-related matters, are an increasingly material consideration for key stakeholders in achieving their own objectives and aims. ESG-related risks may directly or indirectly impact Prudential's business and the achievement of its strategy and consequently those of its key stakeholders, which range from customers, institutional investors, employees and suppliers, to policymakers, regulators, industry organisations and local communities. A failure to transparently and consistently implement the Group's ESG strategy, in its key markets and across operational, underwriting and investment activities, may adversely impact the financial condition and/uni00A0reputation of the Group and may negatively impact the Group's stakeholders, who all have expectations, concerns and aims related to ESG matters, which may differ. In its investment activities, Prudential's stakeholders increasingly place reliance on an approach to responsible investment that demonstrates how ESG considerations are effectively integrated into investment decisions and the performance of fiduciary and stewardship duties, including voting and active engagement decisions with respect to investee companies, as both an asset owner and an asset manager.\n\nA failure to manage the material risks associated with key ESG themes detailed below may adversely impact the reputation and brand of the Group, its ability to attract and retain customers and staff, its ability to/uni00A0deliver on its long-term strategy and therefore the results of its operations and long-term financial success.\n\n## (a) Environmental risks\n\nEnvironmental concerns, notably those associated with climate change, pose significant risks to Prudential and its customers. Prudential's investment horizons are long term and it is therefore exposed to the potential long-term impact of climate change risks, which include the financial and non-financial impact of transition, physical and litigation risks. A failure to understand, manage and provide greater transparency of its exposure to these climate-related risks may have increasing adverse implications for Prudential and its stakeholders.\n\nw\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\ne\n\nep\n\no\n\nr\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns\n\nr\n\ne\n\ns\n\nu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "The global transition to a lower carbon economy may have an adverse impact on investment valuations as the financial assets of carbonintensive companies re-price, and this could result in some asset sectors facing significantly higher costs and a reduction in demand for their products and services. The speed of this transition, and the extent to which it is orderly and managed, will be influenced by factors such as public policy, technology and changes in market or investor sentiment. This climate-related transition risk may adversely impact the valuation of investments held by the Group, and the potential broader economic impact may adversely affect customer demand for the Group's products. Prudential's stakeholders increasingly expect and/or rely on the Group to support an orderly transition based on an understanding of relevant country and company-level transition plans and which takes into consideration the impact on the economies, businesses and customers in the markets in which it operates and invests. The Group's ability to sufficiently understand and appropriately react to transition risk may be limited by insufficient or unreliable data on carbon exposure and transition plans for the assets in which it invests. The direct physical impacts of climate change, driven by both specific short-term climaterelated events such as natural disasters and longer-term changes to climate and the natural environment, will increasingly influence the longevity, mortality and morbidity risk assessments for the Group's life/uni00A0insurance product underwriting and offerings and their associated claims profiles. Climate-driven events in countries in which Prudential or its key third parties operate could impact the Group's operational resilience and its/uni00A0customers.\n\n## (b) Social risks\n\nSocial risks that could impact Prudential may arise from a failure to consider the rights, diversity, wellbeing, and interests of people and communities in which the Group or its third parties operate. These risks/uni00A0are increased as Prudential operates in multiple jurisdictions with distinct local cultures and considerations. As an employer, the Group is/uni00A0also exposed to the risk of being unable to attract, retain and develop highly-skilled staff, which may increase if Prudential does not have in place responsible working practices or fails to recognise the benefits of diversity or promote a culture of inclusion. The potential for reputational risk extends to the Group's supply chains, which may be exposed to factors such as poor labour standards and abuses of human rights by third parties. Emerging population risks associated with public health trends (such as an increase in obesity) and demographic changes (such/uni00A0as population urbanisation and ageing) may affect customer lifestyles and therefore may impact claims against the Group's insurance product offerings. As a provider of insurance and investment services, the Group is increasingly focused on digital innovation, technologies and distribution methods for a broadening range of products and services. As a result, Prudential has access to extensive amounts of customer personal data, including data related to personal health, and an increasing ability to analyse and interpret this data through the use of complex tools, machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. The Group is therefore exposed to the regulatory, ethical and reputational risks associated with customer data/uni00A0misuse or security breaches. These risks are explained above. The/uni00A0increasing digitalisation of products, services and processes may/uni00A0also result in new and unforeseen regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, including those related to how the Group supports its customers through this transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (c) Governance risks\n\nA failure to maintain high standards of corporate governance may adversely impact the Group and its customers, staff and employees, through poor decision-making and a lack of oversight of its key risks. Poor governance may arise where key governance committees have insufficient independence, a lack of diversity, skills or experience in their members, or unclear (or insufficient) oversight responsibilities and mandates. Inadequate oversight over remuneration increases the/uni00A0risk of poor senior management behaviours. Prudential operates across multiple jurisdictions and has a group and subsidiary governance structure which may add further complexity to these considerations. Participation in joint ventures or partnerships where Prudential does not have direct overall control and the use of third party suppliers increase the potential for reputational risks arising from/uni00A0poor governance.",

These measures provide useful information to enhance the understanding of the Group's financial performance. A reconciliation of these APMs to IFRS metrics is provided in additional financial information section of the annual report.\n\n## American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)\n\nThe stocks of most foreign companies that trade in the US markets are traded as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). US depositary banks issue these stocks. Each ADR represents one or more shares of foreign stock or a fraction of a share. The price of an ADR corresponds to the price of the foreign stock in its home market, adjusted to the ratio of the ADRs to foreign company shares.\n\n## Annual premium equivalent (APE)\n\nA measure of new business sales, which is a key metric for the Group's management of the development and growth of the business. APE is calculated as the aggregate of annualised regular premiums from new business and one-tenth of single premiums on new business written during the period for all insurance products, including premiums for contracts designated as investment contracts under IFRS 4.\n\n## Asset-backed security (ABS)\n\nA security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralised (or 'backed') by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets that are unable to be sold individually.\n\n## Assets under management (AUM)\n\nAssets under management represent all assets managed or administered by or on behalf of the Group, including those assets managed by third parties. Assets under management include managed assets that are included within the Group's statement of financial position and those assets belonging to external clients outside the Prudential Group, which are therefore not included in the Group's statement of financial position. These are also referred to as 'funds under management (FUM)'.\n\n## Available for sale (AFS)\n\nSecurities that have been acquired neither for short-term sale nor to be held to maturity. AFS securities are measured at fair value on the statement of financial position with unrealised gains and losses being booked in Other Comprehensive Income instead of the income/uni00A0statement.\n\n## B\n\n## Bancassurance\n\nAn agreement with a bank to offer insurance and investment products to the bank's customers.\n\n## Bonuses\n\nBonuses refer to the non-guaranteed benefit added to participating life insurance policies and are the way in which policyholders receive their share of the profits of the policies.

The insurance company has 'closed the books' on new sales/uni00A0of these products which will remain in run-off until the policies expire and all claims are settled.\n\n## Collective investment schemes (CIS)\n\nCIS is an open-ended investment fund of pooled assets in which an investor can buy and sell units that are issued in the form of/uni00A0shares.\n\n## Constant exchange rates (CER)\n\nPrudential plc reports its results at both actual exchange rates (AER) to reflect actual results and also constant exchange rates (CER) to eliminate the impact from exchange translation. CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using current period foreign currency exchange rates ie current period average rates for the income statements and current period closing rate for the balance sheet.\n\n## Core structural borrowings\n\nBorrowings which Prudential considers forming part of its core capital structure and excludes operational borrowings.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk of loss if another party fails to meet its obligations, or fails to do so in a timely fashion.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe risk that asset or liability values, cash flows, income or expenses will be affected by changes in exchange rates.

        "page_content": "## D\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)\n\nAcquisition costs are expenses of an insurer which are incurred in connection with the acquisition of new insurance contracts or the renewal of existing insurance policies. They include commissions and other variable sales inducements and the direct costs of issuing the policy, such as underwriting and other policy issue expenses. Typically, under IFRS, an element of acquisition costs is deferred ie/uni00A0not expensed in the year incurred, and instead amortised in the income statement in/uni00A0line with the emergence of surpluses on the/uni00A0related contracts.\n\n## Discretionary participation features (DPF)\n\nA contractual right to receive, as a supplement to guaranteed benefits, additional benefits:\n\n- -That are likely to be a significant portion of/uni00A0the total contractual benefits;\n- -Whose amount or timing is contractually at/uni00A0the discretion of the issuer; and\n- -That are contractually based on asset, fund, company or other entity performance.\n\n## Dividend cover\n\nDividend cover is calculated as operating profit after tax on an IFRS basis, divided by the current year interim dividend plus the proposed final dividend.\n\n## E\n\n## Endowment product\n\nAn ordinary individual life insurance product that provides the insured party with various guaranteed benefits if it survives specific maturity dates or periods stated in the policy. Upon the death of the insured party within the coverage period, a designated beneficiary receives the face value of the policy.\n\n## European Embedded Value (EEV)\n\nFinancial results that are prepared on a/uni00A0supplementary basis to the Group's consolidated IFRS results and which are/uni00A0prepared in accordance with a set of/uni00A0Principles issued by the CFO Forum of/uni00A0European Insurance Companies in 2016. Embedded value is a way of measuring the current value to shareholders of the future profits from life business written based on a/uni00A0set of assumptions.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance/uni00A0(ESG)\n\nESG refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business, which is qualitative and nonfinancial and not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.

The contract holder pays the insurer a premium, which is credited to the contract holders' account. Periodically, interest is credited to the contract holders' account and/uni00A0administrative charges are deducted, as/uni00A0appropriate.\n\n## Fixed indexed annuities (FIA)\n\nThese are similar to fixed annuities in that the contract holder pays the insurer a premium, which is credited to the contract holders' account and, periodically, interest is credited to the contract holders' account and administrative charges are deducted, as appropriate. An annual minimum interest rate may be guaranteed, although actual interest credited may be higher and is linked to an equity index over its indexed option period.\n\n## Funds under management (FUM)\n\nSee 'assets under management (AUM)' above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## G\n\n## Group free surplus\n\nGroup free surplus at the end of the period comprises free surplus for the insurance businesses, representing the excess of the net worth over the required capital included in the EEV results and IFRS net assets for the asset management and other businesses, excluding goodwill. The free surplus generated during the period comprises the movement in this balance excluding foreign exchange, capital and other reserve movements. Specifically, it includes amounts maturing from the in-force operations during the period less the investment in new business, the effect of market movements and other one-off items.\n\n## Group pay-out annuities\n\nThese are a closed block of defined benefit annuity plans assumed from John Hancock USA and John Hancock New York in October 2018, in which a single premium payment from an employer (contract holder) funds the/uni00A0pension benefits for its employees (participants).\n\n## Group-wide Supervision (GWS) Framework\n\nRegulatory framework developed by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (see below) for multinational insurance groups under its supervision. The GWS Framework is based on a principle-based and outcome-focused approach, and allows the Hong Kong Insurance Authority to exercise direct regulatory powers over the designated holding companies of multinational insurance groups. The GWS Framework is expected to be effective for Prudential upon designation by the Hong Kong IA in the second quarter of 2021. The primary legislation was enacted in July 2020 and will come into operation on 29 March 2021.\n\n## Guaranteed annuities\n\nPolicies that pay out a fixed amount of benefit for a defined period.\n\n## Guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) (US)\n\nInvestment contracts between an insurance company and an institutional investor, which provide a stated rate of return on deposits over a specified period of time. They typically provide for partial or total withdrawals at book value if needed for certain liquidity needs of the plan.",

Investment risk associated with the product is usually borne by the policyholder. Insurance coverage, investment and administration services are provided for which the charges are deducted from the investment fund assets. Benefits payable will depend on the price of the units prevailing at the time of surrender, death or the maturity of the product, subject to surrender charges. These/uni00A0are also referred to as unit-linked products or unit-linked contracts.\n\n## K\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nThese are measures by which the development, performance or position of the business can be measured effectively. The Group Board reviews the KPIs annually and updates them where appropriate.\n\n## L\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nPrudential calculates this as assets and resources available to us that are readily convertible to cash to cover corporate obligations in a prescribed stress scenario.

RBC limits the amount of risk a company can take and act as a cushion to protect a company from insolvency. RBC is intended to be a minimum regulatory capital standard and not necessarily the full amount of capital that an insurer would want to hold to meet its safety and competitive objectives. In addition, RBC is not designed to be used as a stand-alone tool in determining financial solvency of an insurance company; rather it is one of the tools that give regulators legal authority to take control of an insurance company.\n\n## Risk margin reserve (RMR)\n\nAn RMR is included within operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and represents a charge for long-term expected defaults of debt securities, determined by reference to the credit quality of the portfolio.\n\n## S\n\n## Separate account\n\nA separate account is a pool of investments held by an insurance company not in or 'separate' from its general account.

        "page_content": "## Major shareholders\n\nThe table below shows the holdings of major shareholders in the Company's issued ordinary share capital, as at 31 December 2020, as notified and disclosed to the Company in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n\n| As at 31 December 2020   |   % of total  voting rights |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| BlackRock, Inc           |                        5.08 |\n| Third Point LLC          |                        5.04 |\n\nOn 2 October 2019 Capital Group Companies, Inc notified that its holding had decreased to less than 5 per cent of the Company's issued share capital.\n\nNo notifications have been received from year end to 2 March 2021.\n\n## Rights and obligations\n\nThe rights and obligations attaching to the Company's shares are set out in full in the Articles. There are currently no voting restrictions on/uni00A0the ordinary shares, all of which are fully paid, and each share carries one vote on a poll. If votes are cast on a show of hands, each/uni00A0shareholder present in person or by proxy, or in the case of a corporation, each of its duly authorised corporate representatives, has one vote except that if a proxy is appointed by more than one member, the proxy has one vote for and one vote against if instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution and by one or more members to vote against the resolution.\n\nWhere, under an employee share scheme, participants are the beneficial owners of the shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercisable by the trustee on behalf of the registered owner in accordance with the relevant plan rules. The Trustees would not usually vote any unallocated shares held in trust but they may do so at their discretion provided it would be considered to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust and permitted under the relevant trust deed.\n\nAs at 2 March 2021, Trustees held 0.40 per cent of the issued share capital under the various plans in operation.\n\nRights to dividends under the various schemes are set out on pages 170 to 205.\n\n## Restrictions on transfer\n\nIn accordance with English company law, shares may be transferred by/uni00A0an instrument of transfer or through an electronic system (currently CREST) and any transfer is not restricted except that the Directors may, in certain circumstances, refuse to register transfers of shares\n\nbut/uni00A0only if such refusal does not prevent dealings in the shares from taking place on an open and proper basis. If the Directors make use of that power, they must send the transferee notice of the refusal within two/uni00A0months.\n\nCertain restrictions may be imposed from time to time by applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws) and pursuant to the Listing Rules of both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, as well as under the rules of some of the Group's employee share plans.\n\nAll Directors are required to hold a minimum number of shares under guidelines approved by the Board, which they would also be expected to retain as described on page 197 of the Directors' remuneration report.\n\n## Authority to issue shares\n\nThe Directors require authority from shareholders in relation to the issue of shares. Whenever shares are issued, these must be offered to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings unless the Directors have been given authority by shareholders to issue shares without offering them first to existing shareholders. Prudential seeks authority from its shareholders on an annual basis to issue shares up to a maximum amount, of which a defined number may be issued without pre-emption. Disapplication of statutory pre-emption procedures is also sought for rights issues. The existing authorities to issue shares, and to do so without observing pre-emption rights, are due to expire at/uni00A0the end of this year's AGM. Relevant resolutions to authorise share/uni00A0capital issuances will be put to shareholders at the AGM on/uni00A013 May/uni00A02021.\n\nDetails of shares issued during 2020 and 2019 are given in note C8 on/uni00A0page 282.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of a waiver granted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Prudential confirms that it complies with the applicable law and regulation in the UK in relation to the holding of shares in treasury and with the conditions of the waiver in connection with the purchase of own shares and any treasury shares it may hold.\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nThe Directors also require authority from shareholders in relation to the purchase of the Company's own shares. Prudential seeks authority by special resolution on an annual basis for the buy-back of its own shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and other related guidance. This authority has not been used since it was last granted at the AGM in 2020. This existing authority is due to expire at the end of this year's AGM and a special resolution to renew the authority will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 13 May/uni00A02021.\n\n## Dividend information\n\n| 2020 second interim dividend   | Shareholders  registered on  the UK register  and Hong Kong  branch register   | Holders of US  American  Depositary  Receipts   | Shareholders with  ordinary shares  standing to the  credit of their CDP  securities accounts   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ex-dividend date               | 25 March 2021                                                                  | -                                               | 25 March 2021                                                                                   |\n| Record date                    | 26 March 2021                                                                  | 26 March 2021                                   | 26 March 2021                                                                                   |\n| Payment date                   | 14 May 2021                                                                    | 14 May 2021                                     | On or about  21 May 2021                                                                        |\n\nA number of dividend waivers are in place in respect of shares issued but not allocated under the Group's employee share plans.

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Prudential's beliefs and expectations and including, without limitation, statements containing the words 'may', ' will', 'should', 'continue', 'aims', 'estimates', 'projects', 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'plans', 'seeks' and 'anticipates', and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as at the time they are/uni00A0made, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them./uni00A0By/uni00A0their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and/uni00A0uncertainty.\n\nA number of important factors could cause Prudential's and Jackson's actual future financial condition or performance or other indicated results of the entity referred to in any forward-looking statement to/uni00A0differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the ability to/uni00A0complete the proposed demerger of Jackson Financial Inc. on the/uni00A0anticipated time frame or at all; the ability of the management of/uni00A0Jackson Financial Inc. and its group to deliver on its business plan/uni00A0post-separation; the impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic, including adverse financial market and liquidity impacts, responses and/uni00A0actions taken by regulators and supervisors, the impact to sales, claims and assumptions and increased product lapses, disruption to Prudential's operations (and those of its suppliers and partners), risks associated with new sales processes and information security risks; future market conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates and/uni00A0exchange rates, the potential for a sustained low-interest rate environment, and the impact of economic uncertainty, asset valuation impacts from the transition to a lower carbon economy, derivative instruments not effectively hedging exposures arising from product guarantees, inflation and deflation and the performance of financial markets generally; global political uncertainties, including the potential for increased friction in cross-border trade and the exercise of executive powers to restrict trade, financial transactions, capital movements and/ or investment; the policies and actions of regulatory authorities, including, in particular, the policies and actions of the Hong Kong Insurance Authority, as Prudential's Group-wide supervisor, as well/uni00A0as/uni00A0new government initiatives generally; given its designation as/uni00A0an/uni00A0Internationally Active Insurance Group ('IAIG'), the impact on/uni00A0Prudential of systemic risk and other group supervision policy standards adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors; the impact of competition and fast-paced technological change; the effect on Prudential's business and results from, in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nparticular, mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates; the physical, social and financial impacts of climate change and global health crises on Prudential's business and operations; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or combinations within relevant industries; the impact of internal transformation projects and other strategic actions failing to meet their objectives; the effectiveness of reinsurance for Prudential's businesses; the risk that Prudential's operational resilience (or that of its/uni00A0suppliers and partners) may prove to be inadequate, including in relation to operational disruption due to external events; disruption to/uni00A0the availability, confidentiality or integrity of Prudential's information technology, digital systems and data (or those of its suppliers and partners); any ongoing impact on Prudential of the demerger of M&G plc and, if and when completed, the demerger of Jackson Financial Inc.; the impact of changes in capital, solvency standards, accounting standards or relevant regulatory frameworks, and tax and other legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Prudential and/uni00A0its/uni00A0affiliates operate; the impact of legal and regulatory actions, investigations and disputes; and the impact of not adequately responding to environmental, social and governance issues. These/uni00A0and/uni00A0other important factors may, for example, result in changes/uni00A0to assumptions used for determining results of operations or/uni00A0re-estimations of reserves for future policy benefits. Further discussion of these and other important factors that could cause Prudential's actual future financial condition or performance or other/uni00A0indicated results of the entity referred to in any forward-looking statements to differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in/uni00A0Prudential's forward-looking statements can be found under the/uni00A0'Risk Factors' heading of this document.\n\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date on which they are made. Prudential expressly disclaims any obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained in this document or any other forward-looking statements it may make, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise except as required pursuant to the UK Prospectus Rules, the UK Listing Rules, the UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the SGX-ST listing/uni00A0rules or other applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Cautionary statements\n\nThis document does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase, acquire, subscribe for, sell, dispose of or issue, or any solicitation of any offer to purchase, acquire, subscribe for, sell or dispose of, any securities in any jurisdiction nor shall it (or any part of/uni00A0it) or the fact of its distribution, form the basis of, or be relied on in connection with, any contract therefor.",
