        "page_content": "## Letter from our Chair\n\n## Dear fellow shareholders,\n\n2020 will be remembered as a very different year. It is not the first time that a pandemic has swept the world. What is unprecedented is that it has happened at a time when our modern, highly developed societies have started to believe in their own infallibility. Covid-19 has reminded us of mankind's vulnerabilities, despite our technological progress and sophistication. This is a serious warning for society to prepare for future crises. At the same time, luckily, people have proven resilient and resourceful.\n\nAs long-term, engaged owners, Investor's role during 2020 has, as always, been to support our companies. I am impressed by how quickly they took action to safeguard employees, customers and liquidity, while continuing to make strategic investments in R&D, new technology, digitalization and sustainability.\n\n## The importance of corporates\n\nIn fact I am impressed by, and proud of, how the business community as a whole, in Sweden and elsewhere, has stepped up and contributed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Vaccines have been developed record-fast.\n\nMany companies have scrambled to provide medical equipment. Others have redesigned their offerings and ways of working to help their customers.\n\nConsidering these considerable achievements, I am at times confounded by the lop-sided public view of the corporate sector, with an exaggerated focus on owners seeking government support in tough times. One can never highlight enough the importance of corporates in creating and maintaining jobs, generating taxes, and bringing forward new, innovative technologies.\n\nFor example, during 2020, the debate on companies' right to decide on their own dividends in times of crisis and government support was running high. I am convinced that the dividend decision is entirely up to the owners of the individual company, based on its specific situation. I believe that the price society is paying for stopping dividends is very high. Dividends are important for the overall economy for several reasons. Dividends provide vital income for individuals, pension funds, foundations and universities. Another aspect is the reallocation of capital from well-capitalized companies to others, often young and innovative, with\n\nbigger capital needs. These aspects are often left out in the public debate.\n\n## Accelerating trends\n\nOne of our major challenges is also to accelerate innovation to fight climate change. As this threat is real and imminent, speed is crucial. The corporate sector has an important role in supporting\n\nthe transition to a sustainable lowcarbon economy. During 2020, Investor launched ambitious sustainability focus areas and targets to further future-proof Investor and our companies. Climate change is a reality and it is in the interest of business to take its responsibilities as well as understand that this is a unique opportunity for innovation. Digitalization and automation are also key for all companies seeking to outperform competition. Our companies are ambitious and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naiming to be at the forefront, but clearly need to continue to invest substantially to stay ahead.\n\nIn that context, I would also like to reinforce my message from last year that Europe lags behind in implementing 5G, a technology that is key to Europeans and European companies to be competitive vis-a-vis US and Chinese companies.\n\n## Increasing geopolitical risks\n\nEvery year, I repeat that globalization and free trade are forces of good, creating global prosperity. Sadly, we seem to be moving away from globalization and free trade to a more bi-polarized world, which could have grave consequences for the economy long-term. As Sweden is dependent on international trade, I participate in many discussions on a Swedish, European and international level to ensure that the voice of business is heard on the support of free trade.\n\n## Insights from an extraordinary year\n\nThe pandemic has reminded us all about our inability to foresee all crises. With that in mind, ensuring financial flexibility and operational agility is critical for all companies. It has also shown how intertwined the world is, and that we need more rather than less collaboration.\n\n## A strong year for Investor\n\nDespite the challenges, 2020 turned out well for Investor and our position is strong, both strategically and financially. Given this, I am pleased that the Board of Directors is able to propose a dividend of SEK 14 per share for fiscal 2020. Our goal to pay a steadily rising dividend is intact.\n\nOn behalf of the Board I would like to thank our CEO Johan Forssell and the entire team at Investor for delivering, once more, strong results, particularly during an exceptional year.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank you, dear fellow shareholders for your continued support and trust in Investor.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Letter from our CEO\n\n## Dear fellow shareholders,\n\nClosing the books on a very challenging 2020, we now see positive factors in terms of covid-19 vaccines being rolled out, as well as overall strong operational performance and resilience in our portfolio. However, the pandemic is not yet under control, trade and technology related tensions have risen and some industries are facing structural challenges. In addition, the huge liquidity provided by central banks has led to ultra-low capital costs and sharp asset inflation, creating significant medium-term risk for equities, should inflation and interest rates rise faster than expected. As always, predicting the future is difficult, why flexibility remains key.\n\nDespite the pandemic and its impact, 2020 was a strong year for Investor:\n\n- \u00b7 Our companies successfully adapted to the rapidly changing business environment, delivering strong results while continuing to invest in prioritized areas.\n- \u00b7 Within Listed Companies, we invested in ABB,  Ericsson and Electrolux Professional at attractive levels during the spring.\n- \u00b7 In total, the major subsidiaries within Patricia Industries grew organic sales and profit, despite the impact from covid-19. Patricia Industries acquired its 9th subsidiary, Advanced Instruments, the global industry leader within osmolality testing. In addition, several add-on acquisitions were made.\n- \u00b7 The value of our investments in EQT grew by 55 percent.\n- \u00b7 We further stepped up our sustainability work and launched targets for Investor and our portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Despite net investments of SEK 13bn, our financial position remains strong, supported by strong cash flow and a successful bond issue.\n- \u00b7 Our adjusted net asset value grew 14 percent. Our total shareholder return of 19 percent beat the SIXRX return index by 4 percentage points.\n\n## Insights from an extraordinary year\n\nFrom a company perspective, there are many insights gained during the extraordinary year 2020, not the least the importance of being agile and flexible, and being able to take swift action. I believe that our companies and their management teams did a great job in safeguarding employees, adapting costs and protecting liquidity. The pandemic and its effects on the global economy tested the resilience and stability in companies' supply chains and business models. Companies that take necessary action to ensure resilience, while remaining cost efficient, will emerge stronger after the pandemic. Another insight is that trends that were already prevalent before the pandemic, for example sustainability, digitalization and automation, have accelerated further. These trends create many opportunities for our companies.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nWe have a strong portfolio, a clear and proven governance model, an extensive network of top-quality people and strong financial flexibility. From this position of strength, we continue to focus on two strategic priorities:\n\n## Ensure an attractive portfolio\n\nOur companies have strong market positions and high exposure to attractive long-term trends. Within medtech and healthcare, they benefit from demographic trends and we see good opportunities for geographic expansion. Within automation, companies such as Atlas Copco, ABB and Piab are well positioned to capture vast opportunities. EQT offers strong exposure to the growing segment alternative investments, while Ericsson and Nasdaq are good examples of companies with strong technology offerings, important in an increasingly digital world. We will continue to invest selectively in our three business areas. At the same time, we continue to evaluate our companies to determine their potential and whether we are the right owner.\n\nBased on our proven governance model, our portfolio of great companies and our strong financial position, I am convinced that we are well positioned to continue to generate attractive returns.\n\nI would like to thank all Investor employees for the engagement, hard work and for adapting so quickly to an extraordinary situation. I think this really shows the strength in Investor's corporate culture.\n\nFinally, I want to thank you, dear fellow shareholders, for your confidence in Investor.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The emissions from Investor AB are low as Investor has no operating business and its premises have a high proportion of renewable electricity. Increased remote working due to covid-19 and increased energy efficiency explain the reduction in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, emissions from our companies equaled 1,482,500 tonnes, a reduction of 40 percent compared to 2016. The data includes our portfolio companies' scope 1 and 2 emissions. In the yearly sustainability questionnaire Investor tracked that 78 percent of our companies have targets to reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions (50).

Gross cash amounted to SEK 21,862m (24,894). Our target leverage range is 5-10 percent over a business cycle. While leverage can fluctuate above and below the target level, it should not exceed 25 percent for a longer period of time. The leverage policy is set to allow us to capture investment opportunities and support our companies.\n\n## Future development\n\nWe will continue to drive sustainability, digitalization and automation to further future-proof our companies and strengthen their competitiveness. We will continue to invest selectively in our three business areas, while constantly evaluating our companies to determine their long-term potential and if we are the right owner. Within Listed Companies, we will continue to gradually invest in selected listed companies. Within Patricia Industries, we focus on developing the existing companies and investing in new subsidiaries. We will also continue to invest selectively in EQT funds. Our operating priorities, to grow net asset value, operate efficiently and pay a steadily rising dividend, remain firm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Change in net debt SEK m                              | 2020    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Opening net debt                                      | -11,962 |\n| Listed Companies                                      |         |\n| Dividends                                             | 7,281   |\n| Other capital distributions                           | 21      |\n| Investments, net of proceeds                          | -3,382  |\n| Management cost                                       | -113    |\n| Total                                                 | 3,807   |\n| Patricia Industries                                   |         |\n| Proceeds                                              | 6,314   |\n| Investments                                           | -10,657 |\n| Internal transfer to Investor                         | -2,938  |\n| Management cost                                       | -289    |\n| Other  1)                                             | 142     |\n| Total                                                 | -7,429  |\n| Investments in EQT                                    |         |\n| Proceeds (divestitures, fee surplus,carry, dividends) | 4,801   |\n| Draw-downs (investments and management fees)          | -4,620  |\n| Management cost                                       | -10     |\n| Total                                                 | 171     |\n| Investor Groupwide                                    |         |\n| Dividend to shareholders                              | -6,889  |\n| Internal transfer from Patricia Industries            | 2,938   |\n| Management cost                                       | -119    |\n| Other  2)                                             | -331    |\n| Closing net debt                                      | -19,812 |\n\n1) Including currency related effects and net interest paid.\n\n2)  Including currency related effects, revaluation of net debt and net interest paid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSkulds\u00e4ttningsgrad\n\nMkr\n\n600 000\n\n500 000\n\n20\n\n400 000\n\n%\n\n30\n\nAdministration Report - Financial Development\n\nAdministration Report - Financial Development",

We are typically the largest owner and actively support our companies. We develop the companies over time as long as we see further value creation potential. Our long-term perspective is never an excuse for weak short-term performance.\n\nAs an engaged owner, we exercise our influence through our companies' boards. We strive for strong alignment with the chairperson and regularly invite all chairpersons in our companies to a 'Chairs' Circle' to discuss key trends and share knowledge.\n\nThe success of our companies depends on their ability to drive change and capture opportunities. The acceleration of technology development offers new opportunities, for example within digitalization and automation, which are key focus areas for our companies. Companies need to focus on long-term investments and continuous efficiency improvements simultaneously. To support this, we encourage collaboration, innovation, operational excellence and relentless execution, so that the companies can be successful and grow profitably over time.\n\nTo further future-proof our companies and ensure their long-term competitiveness, we drive our ambitious sustainability agenda.\n\nA strong corporate structure is essential to achieve profitable growth, which is why we continuously evaluate the structures in our companies to identify potential value-creating opportunities. Recent examples of this are the spinoffs of Epiroc from Atlas Copco and Electrolux Professional from Electrolux, ABB's divestment of Power Grids, and strategic acquisitions in Atlas Copco, Ericsson, Laborie and Sarnova.\n\n## A strong corporate structure is essential to achieve profitable growth\n\nOur results ultimately depend on the people in our companies. Therefore, we spend considerable time ensuring that we have the best possible board members and CEOs in our companies. We will focus further on the succession planning in our companies, continue to make sure the boards are the best possible in terms of competence, experience and diversity, still considering their size. We want board members in our companies to be experienced, engaged and they should be able to devote significant time to their assignment. In this work, our extensive industrial network is a highly valuable asset.\n\n## Ensure an attractive portfolio\n\nWe will invest in selected existing listed companies when we find attractive opportunities. Within  Patricia Industries, our ambition is to make add-on acquisitions through our current platform companies and invest in new platform companies. We will continue to invest selectively in new EQT funds.\n\nIf we arrive at the conclusion that a certain company would be better off in a different ownership, or that it no longer offers enough attractive development potential, we would actively drive a divestment process and try to maximize the value for our shareholders.\n\n## Safeguard financial strength\n\nWe strive to always maintain strong financial flexibility. A strong balance sheet gives us the ability to capture attractive investment opportunities and to support our companies. Over the past decade, we have generated strong cash flow based on dividends from Listed Companies, distribution from Patricia Industries' companies and net proceeds from Investments in EQT. The cash flow generation capacity that we have established is a key strength as it substantially increases our financial flexibility, enabling us to both invest and generate a steadily rising dividend.",

Investor firmly believes that a sustainable business approach is a prerequisite for creating long-term value.\n\n## Business-driven approach\n\nInvestor takes a business-driven approach to sustainability as we believe this is a prerequisite for creating longterm value, both in our role as a company and in our role as a responsible owner. We define sustainability as the delivery of long-term value in economic, environmental and social terms.\n\nIt is in our role as an owner that we have the most impact, through the capital we provide, our engaged ownership and through our representation on the boards. In addition, we create value through the employment, innovations, products and services delivered by our companies.\n\nWhen we support our companies to develop best-in-class businesses, they create value for their customers, for society, and in turn, for us and our shareholders.\n\nof areas within governance, ethics, risk and compliance. The areas are selected based on a risk assessment and include, among other areas, ethical business conduct, whistleblowing, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. Investor's subsidiaries are reviewed in relation to these areas and in addition, one or two focus areas are selected every year for a deep-dive review.\n\nIn 2020, the focus areas have been anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Representatives from all subsidiaries have participated in an awareness training followed by a review of the subsidiaries' processes. Dialogs have also been held with all listed companies about their efforts to prevent corruption and bribery. All companies have set a zero tolerance principle against corruption and bribery and have established a process for implementation. Read more on page 117.\n\nInvestor's approach is built on materiality and the most important sustainability areas are identified based on our impact both as a company and an owner:\n\n- \u00b7 Business Ethics & Governance\n- \u00b7 Climate & Resource Efficiency\n- \u00b7 Diversity & Inclusion\n\n## Business Ethics & Governance\n\nWe are convinced that good business ethics and governance are key to build strong and successful companies. Investor has zero tolerance for nonethical business behavior.\n\nIn our role as an owner we have developed Investor's Sustainability Guidelines that set clear expectations for Investor and our companies to conduct their operations in a responsible and ethical manner. Investor has a structured process for this work that covers a range\n\n## UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nInvestor is committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and contributes to a number of them.

        "page_content": "## Climate & Resource Efficiency\n\nThe business community has a key role in taking action and coming up with new innovative solutions to combat climate change and increase resource efficiency. Investor is committed to climate targets aligned with the Paris Agreement and aims to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nInvestor AB's scope 1 and 2 emissions equaled 88 tonnes in 2020, a reduction of 26 percent compared to 2016. The reduction is mainly due to increased remote working during covid-19. To reach our target, we will continue to reduce emissions from energy consumption and company cars. A number of initiatives have been implemented in our main office, e.g. motion lighting, solar panels and charging posts for electric vehicles.\n\nAs a long-term owner, we need to take into account risks as well as business opportunities related to climate change and thus accelerate the transition to a sustainable low carbon economy. The portfolio companies' scope 1 and 2 emissions equaled 1,482,500 tonnes in 2020, a reduction of 40 percent compared to 2016. Investor works through the board representatives by engaging and following up with the companies on their targets and measures to reduce their climate impact. In 2020, we developed the integration of climate strategies in our value creation plans in order to reach our target to reduce portfolio emissions by 50 percent by 2030. By the end of 2020, 57 percent of our companies had aligned their reduction targets with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn addition, Investor expects that all the companies have targets to reduce emissions from their value chain, for  example related to the use of their products (companies' scope 3). In 2020, 43 percent of the companies had scope 3 targets and 57 percent had resource efficiency targets. Read more on page 119-120.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion\n\nInvestor strongly believes that diverse teams characterized by inclusion and different perspectives stimulate innovation and drive better decision-making. We strive for diversity across all dimensions: nationality, age, gender, education, different mindsets and experiences.\n\nWe are convinced that making use of the total available talent base builds stronger teams. When recruiting, our ambition is to have a diverse slate of candidates and interview panels. Investor has set the target to maintain a gender balance of 40/60 in the Management Group, meaning at least 40 percent of the underrepresented gender. In 2020, the proportion of women in Investor's Management Group was 60 percent and 50 percent in the overall organization.\n\nWe measure perceived inclusion through employee surveys. In 2020, our employees reported a high level of inclusion compared to the external benchmark, scoring 8.9 ( s c a l e  1-10).\n\nInvestor drives diversity among our portfolio companies through the nomination committees and board representation. Investor's targets for 2030 are to reach a gender balance of 40/60 at an aggregated level in the portfolio companies' boards and management groups. In 2020, Investor developed a tool to monitor the progress against these goals. In addition, Investor has a target to ensure that all companies measure the perceived level of inclusion among employees regularly.\n\nIn 2020, the average share of women in the companies' boards was 30 percent (25). In the management groups the share was 25 percent (24). There were 14 nationalities represented in the boards and 23 in the management groups. In 2020, 83 percent of the companies had diversity targets and 87 percent measured inclusion.

We are convinced that top quality individuals with diverse minds make all the difference. In a small organization like Investor's, each individual is important, and makes an impact.\n\nWe believe some attributes to be more important, such as passion, openmindedness and the ability to collaborate, along with an interest in strategic and financial considerations.\n\nInvestor applies a flexible working format and our philosophy is that you are given a high degree of freedom while considering what best fits the needs of the business. We also believe that there is a value in its own right in meeting and interacting.\n\nCreating a work-life balance is prioritized at Investor. For instance we provide employee benefits which are selected to assist work-life balance in line with our culture.\n\nInvestor offers internships twice a year.

Our top priority is to protect our employees' health, providing resources to enable everyone to work from home. A key challenge is to keep the energy, motivation and team spirit going.\n\n## Individuals with diverse minds make all the di/fference\n\nTo do this, we have worked with many different activities, holding our first company-wide, fully digital internal conference and a large number of inter active meetings on different organizational levels. On two occasions, we have surveyed the engagement of our employees. We have also emphasized the importance of present and accessible leadership. We have encouraged employees to meet and exercise together outdoors to promote physical activity. We will continue to enable flexibility regarding working hours and location even after the pandemic is over. We will also utilize the fact that all employees have advanced their digital skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth and development\n\nWe believe in supporting everyone to reach their full potential and make sure everybody has a sense of direction. We work with the framework 'Impact and Development' (InD), a continuous approach for discussion on goals and priorities, values, development and feedback.\n\nWe look at professional development broadly. We offer internal and external trainings but also job rotations to portfolio companies and within  Investor. The primary focus for professional development and up-skilling is onthe-job training. We regularly organize activities to build a learning organization and  promote collaboration and sharing of knowledge. 'Investor Explore' is our umbrella for our own individual learning process where we want to support our curious mindsets, seek and share new knowledge, influences and perceptions.\n\nWe use '360-degree feedback', a process through which feedback from colleagues and managers, as well as a self-evaluation by the employee, is gathered. Investor uses this process mainly to assist our employees in developing work skills and behaviors.\n\n## Key activities 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Modernize our way of working digital development\n- \u00b7 Launch of new platform to drive employee engagement\n- \u00b7 Developed InD Framework for goal setting, feedback and personal growth and development\n- \u00b7 Advanced physical and social work environment\n\n## Focus going forward\n\n- \u00b7 Framework for upskilling and personal development\n- \u00b7 Continue to develop ways of working following lessons from remote working during covid-19",

Proactive risk management is crucial for successful governance and operations. The Board frequently follows up on limits and risk exposure to ensure the ability to reach business strategies and goals.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring efficient risk management. At Investor, risk management is an integral part of the Group's processes and is kept close to business operations. The Board has adopted policies with risk levels, mandates and limits for the parent company and its business areas, while the boards of the subsidiaries decide and follow up on policies that have been adapted to manage the risks in their respective businesses. Risk management is conducted continuously in the day to day business at Investor and in the portfolio companies.\n\nA comprehensive risk assessment is made annually to identify and eval-\n\n## Risks\n\n## Risk Mitigating Actions\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Commercial risk\n\nBeing a long-term owner, the exposure to companies and sectors vary over time depending on economic development. Market conditions and industry dynamics change, and transactions may not be feasible at a preferred time.\n\n## Technology shift risk\n\nThe pace of technology change and the digital transformation is rapid. Being at the forefront of R&D and adapting to new technology is a prerequisite for all portfolio companies to become or remain best-inclass.\n\n## Environmental and climate-related risk\n\nIndirect risks related to environmental factors of our portfolio companies continue to grow in importance at the same time as regulatory activity and reporting requirements are increasing. This includes for example resource scarcity, climate change and biodiversity. Environmental related risks have bearing on most traditional risk types, such as reputational and market risk for our portfolio companies.\n\n## Political and geopolitical risk\n\nPolitical and geopolitical uncertainty has implications on the portfolio companies' businesses and strategies. Increased international trade restrictions may lead to deglobalization and impact the business environment in which the portfolio companies operate.\n\nThe Board has set investment principles and adopted a policy. The overall portfolio risk is mitigated by investments in several different industries and geographies. The business teams and the Management Group follow up continuously and report regularly to the Board on the development of the portfolio. For further details see Engaged ownership, page 12.\n\nInvestor's business teams constantly analyze the industries and the technology development and adapt the value creation plans. The risk is managed by continuous focus on agile and flexible business models, product development, customer needs, market analysis and cost efficiency. The value creation plans are reported to Investor's and Patricia Industries' boards. Investor's Management and Board regularly discuss and follow-up on the value creation plans.\n\nFor further details see Engaged ownership, page 12.\n\nThe Board has adopted a Sustainability policy and has set clear expectations on the portfolio companies. Investor expects the portfolio companies to continue to mitigate negative environmental impact and transition to a low carbon economy, e.g. by developing climate strategies, committing to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. This work is driven through the board representatives in the individual companies including following up on companies' targets and measures to reduce their environmental impact. Investor also monitors and follows up on the portfolio companies' progress through dialog and reporting.\n\nFor further details and Investor's TCFD disclosures, see page 15, 119-120.\n\nThe Board and Management Group monitor and work proactively to assess political and geopolitical risks and how they affect the portfolio companies' businesses. When possible, Investor representatives participate in various relevant forums to present our case to promote transparency, a level playing field and free trade.\n\nuate existing and emerging risks. This assessment encompasses all categories of risks and involves the  Management Group, representatives from the whole organization as well as input from the subsidiaries. Material risks are compiled in a company-wide risk map. When needed, action plans are defined and implemen ted to minimize the probability and impact of identified risks.\n\nThe conclusions drawn from the risk assessments are discussed and confirmed with the Board. The CEO and Management Group continuously follow up on the implementation of action plans and report back to the Board.\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic has affected the risk management both within\n\nInvestor and in our companies. After safeguarding our employees, focus is on being close to our companies to support them in managing the effects on the businesses, focusing on customers, cash flow and liquidity. Essential risks that impact Investor fall within different risk categories and are described below.\n\nThese risks can individually, or in combination, have a major negative impact on the business. Actions to mitigate these risks are crucial and part of the everyday business at Investor.\n\nFor further description on risk management, see page 47 and 61-63.",

        "page_content": "## Uncertainty factors\n\nCommercial and financial risks are the most significant risks and uncertainty factors affecting the Group. During 2020, the global economy, financial markets and societies have been significantly impacted by covid-19. For Investor, the impact has been uneven, with some portfolio companies being severely negatively affected, while others have been much more resilient.\n\nCurrently, there are positive factors, e.g. the roll-out of covid-19 vaccines, that should help the world economy stabilize and recover. However, the strength and sustainability of a recovery remain uncertain and depend on the continued development of the pandemic and measures to handle it. In addition, growing geopolitical uncertainties increase tradeand technology-related risks. Some industries also face structural challenges.\n\nThe unprecedented liquidity provided by central banks has led to ultra-low cost of capital and sharp asset inflation, creating significant medium-term risk for equity valuations, should inflation and interest rates rise faster than currently expected. The above uncertainties may have a material adverse impact on Investor's and the portfolio companies' business operations and financial situations.\n\n## Risks\n\n## Risk Mitigating Actions\n\n## Financial risks\n\nThe risks of losses due to changes in market variables such as fluctuations of share prices, interest rates and currency rates, are significant for Investor. Share price risk is the largest. The risks that liquidity is unavailable to meet payment commitments or that financing cannot be obtained or only at increased cost due to changed market conditions, are other essential financial risks.\n\n## Compliance risks\n\n## Business ethics risk\n\nHigh ethical standards, respect for human rights and labor laws are the foundation for a strong and sustainable business. The risk of bribery and corruption or the risk of investing in companies with insufficient ethical business conduct, poor working conditions or non-compliance with labor rights all carry a reputational risk and can have a significant negative effect on both Investor, the portfolio companies and other stakeholders.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nAll businesses and operations are affected by laws, regulations, agreements,  sanctions and other regulatory requirements. Non-compliance with any of the above will significantly affect the business and reputation negatively, for both Investor and the portfolio companies.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Cyber and information security risk\n\nCyber and information security risk is an increasingly material risk that continuously evolves. Security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking or data leakage may have a direct impact on the operations of Investor and the portfolio companies.\n\n## Key personnel/succession risk\n\nThe ability to attract and retain the right competence is a very important prerequisite for Investor's long-term success. Our network is key to finding the best board and management candidates for our companies as well as for recruitment to Investor.\n\nLimits for financial risks are set in the Finance policy adopted by the Board. A measure to manage fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates is the option to hedge by using derivative instruments. The share price risk is not hedged. Daily procedures are established to monitor, evaluate and report to the Management Group on current exposure. Also, ensuring financial preparedness by managing the liquidity ratio, allocating loan maturities over time and diversifying sources of capital are continuous risk mitigating activities. Regular reports on exposure versus set limits are provided to the Audit and Risk Committee by Treasury and Risk Control.\n\nFor further details see note 3, Financial risks and risk management page 61-63.\n\nThe Board has adopted a Policy framework with principles on how Investor should act as a responsible owner and company. Investor has set clear expectations on all portfolio companies to act responsibly and ethically. It is the responsibility of each portfolio company and its management to analyze and take systematic action to reduce these risks. New portfolio companies are evaluated in the investment process' due diligence. Investor follows up the subsidiaries on a range of areas within governance, ethics, risk and compliance, all selected based on risk assessment. Preventive measures include regular risk assessments, procedure development to mitigate risk, regular employee training to strengthen awareness and having whistleblowing channels implemented. For further details see Business Ethics and Governance, page 14, 116-117.\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations is a basic principle in the Policy framework adopted by the Board. Preventive measures taken are among other internal controls implemented in procedures as well as control functions following-up on compliance. The regulatory environment is continuously monitored in order to prepare for changes that may impact the business.\n\nThe Board has adopted an Information security policy. The Management Group has implemented procedures and continuity plans to identify, protect, detect, recover and respond to incidents. Investor assesses regularly its risk profile and invests continuously to protect its systems and improve recovery plans. To increase awareness in the organization, employees are trained. Status and actions are regularly reported to and discussed within the Audit and Risk committee.\n\nThe Board and the boards in the portfolio companies continuously identify required key skills, to support the companies' long-term ambitions and needs, and reach out to individuals with relevant industrial, functional and geographical knowledge to broaden the network. The ability to attract, retain and develop individuals within Investor is supported by several measures including e.g. a well-defined recruitment process, succession planning, a competitive and long-term approach to compensation, and a focus on development opportunities through the performance reviews.\n\nFor further details see People at the Center, page 16.",

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the Board must consist of no less than three and no more than thirteen Directors, as well as no more than four deputies. At the 2020 AGM ten members and no deputies were elected. The CEO is the only Board member employed by Investor.\n\nThe Nomination Committee applied the Code rule 4.1 as diversity policy in its nomination work. The aim is to achieve a well functioning composition of the Board when it comes to diversity and breadth, as relates to, inter alia, gender, nationality, age and industry experience. The current Board composition is the result of the work of the Nomination Committee prior to the 2020 AGM. The Nomination",

        "page_content": "Committee is of the opinion that the Board has an appropriate composition and size and reflects diversity and good variety regarding qualifications and experiences within areas of strategic importance to Investor. In respect of gender balance, excluding the CEO, 44 percent of the Board are women (based on nine elected members who are not employed by Investor).\n\nThe composition of Investor's Board meets the requirements concerning the independence of Directors. Several of the Board members are Directors of Investor's holdings and they  receive Board compensation from these companies. This is not considered to entail a dependence of these members on Investor or its Management. Investor is an industrial holding company and works actively through the boards of its holdings to identify and drive valuecreating initiatives. The work of the Board in Investor's holdings is the core of Investor's engaged ownership model. For Investor, where a fundamental component is to have the right board in each company, it is natural that members of Investor's Board and Management have board assignments in Investor's holdings.\n\nA more detailed presentation of the Board is found on page 48 and on the website.\n\n## Work of the Board\n\nDuring the year, the Board held 17 meetings (of which 6 per capsulam). The Board members' attendance is shown on page 48. The secretary of the Board meetings was, with a few exceptions, Investor's General Counsel, Petra Hedengran. Each Board meeting has included an item on the agenda during which the\n\nBoard had the opportunity to discuss without representatives of the Management being present.\n\nThe Board has discussed, among other things, the acquisition of shares in ABB, Ericsson and Electrolux Professional, investments in EQT funds, cyber security and other strategic matters. In order to future-proof Investor and the portfolio companies, the Board has decided on three focus areas within sustainability; Business Ethics & Governance, Climate & Resource Efficiency, as well as Diversity & Inclusion. In light of the effects of covid-19 and the developments in the society, the Board decided to postpone the AGM to June, when the AGM was carried out through advance voting pursuant to temporary legislation. Covid-19 and its effects on society, the world economy and the portfolio companies have also prompted more frequent Board meetings with updates regarding the portfolio companies' situation.\n\nThe Board has devoted time to both internal and external presentations of the financial markets, among other things with a focus on macro effects as a consequence of covid-19. The Board has discussed the development and the effects on industries, markets and individual companies, paying particularly close attention to Investor's holdings and the long-term strategies of such holdings.\n\nFurthermore, the Management of Patricia Industries has held a presentation on the development of this business area and its portfolio companies, including the acquisition of the subsi diary Advanced Instruments, as well as the key points in Patricia Industries' value creation plans.\n\nAn important part of the Board's work is the financial reports presented, including those prior to the interim report, the interim management statements and the year-end report. At regular Board meetings reports are delivered on the ongoing operations in the business areas, together with in-depth analyses and proposed actions regarding holdings. Sustainability performance and succession planning are evaluated yearly by the Board. During the year, the Management presented value creation plans for Listed Companies, including analyses of the holdings' operations and development potential in the business areas where they are active. These analyses were discussed and assessed by the Board with a focus on the individual companies as well as in the context of overall strategic discussions. The Board also discussed the overall strategy for Investor thoroughly at the yearly strategy review.\n\nThe Board regularly received and discussed reports on the composition of portfolios and developments within Patricia Industries and Investor's involvement in EQT.\n\nIn addition to participating in meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Investor's auditor also attended a Board meeting during which Board members had the opportunity to pose questions to the auditor without representatives of the Management being present.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nIn order to increase the efficiency of its work and enable a more detailed analysis of certain issues, the Board has formed Committees. The Board Committees are the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The members of the Committees are appointed for\n\nBoard composition as of December 31, 2020, excluding executives (CEO)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The issues considered at Committee meetings are recorded in minutes and reported at the next Board meeting. Representatives from Investor's specialist functions always participate in Committee meetings.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for assuring the quality of the financial reporting and the efficiency in the internal control system. The Audit and Risk Committee also evaluates financial strategies, risk exposure and that the company's compliance efforts are effective.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are, among other things, to monitor, evaluate and prepare remuneration guidelines. The Committee decides remuneration to the members of the Exten ded Management Group, except for the CEO for whom the Board as a whole sets the remuneration.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board and CEO\n\nThe Chair of the Board initiates an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board and the Board Committees. The objective of the evaluation is to provide insight into the Board members' opinions about the performance of the Board and identify measures that could make the work of the Board more effective. A secondary objective is to form an overview of the areas the Board believes should be afforded greater scope and where additional expertise might be needed.\n\nThe 2020 evaluation was carried out with the support of an external consultant, where the evaluation was answered by each Board member. In addition, the Chair of the Board met with each Board member separately to discuss the work done by the Board during the year. The Board discussed the results of this year's evaluation and the Chair of the Board reported them to the Nomination Committee.\n\nInvestor's Board continuously evaluates the performance of the CEO by monitoring the development of the business in relation to established criteria. A formal performance review is carried out once a year.",

        "page_content": "## The CEO and Management Group\n\nThe Board appoints the CEO and approves the Instruction for the CEO. The CEO is responsible for the day to day business of Investor, for example ongoing investments, employees, finance and accounting issues and regular contact with Investor's stakeholders, such as public authorities and the financial market. The CEO ensures that the Board is provided with the necessary material for making well-informed decisions.\n\nThe CEO has appointed an Extended Management Group to support in the management of Investor's overall business. For members of the Extended Management Group, see page 50.\n\n## Control functions\n\nThe Risk Control function is responsible for coordinating the internal reporting of Investor's significant risks at the aggregate level. The Risk Control function reports to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe Compliance function supports Investor's compliance with laws and regulations, and maintains internal regulatory systems and education to this end. The Compliance function reports to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe review function, Internal Control, provides objective support to the Board on matters relating to the internal control structure, partly by investigating major areas of risk and partly by performing reviews and follow-ups in selected areas. The Internal Control function regularly provides reports on its work to the Audit and Risk Committee during the year.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n## Compensation to the Board\n\nThe total compensation to the Board approved by the 2020 AGM was SEK 10,950t. Since the 2008 AGM, it is possible for Board members to receive a portion of their remuneration in the form of synthetic shares. The allocation of the Board compensation is provided on page 48 and in note 11, Employees and personnel costs.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy stating that Board members, who do not already have such holdings, are expected to, over a five-year period, acquire an ownership in Investor shares (or a corresponding exposure to the Investor share, e.g. in the form\n\nof synthetic shares) with a market value equivalent to at least one year's Board compensation, before taxes, excluding remuneration for Committee work.\n\n| Board compensation resolved   by the 2020 AGM, SEK Chair  1)   | 2,800,000   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Vice Chair  1)                                                 | 1,625,000   |\n| Member  1)                                                     | 750,000     |\n| Chair Audit and Risk Committee                                 | 305,000     |\n| Member Audit and Risk Committee                                | 200,000     |\n| Chair Remuneration Committee                                   | 180,000     |\n| Member Remuneration Committee                                  | 95,000      |\n\n## Remuneration to the Management Group\n\nThe total remuneration for the CEO is determined by the Board. Remuneration issues concerning other members of the Extended Management Group are decided by the Remuneration Committee, after which the Board is informed.\n\nInvestor's policy is for the Extended Management Group to own shares in Investor corresponding to a market value of at least one year's gross salary for the CEO and at least half of one year's gross salary for the other members of the Extended Management Group.\n\nGuidelines for remuneration for the CEO and other members of the Extended Management Group, adopted to new legal requirements, were decided at the 2020 AGM and are in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year to the general meeting. See page 52 and on the website for the most recently approved guidelines on remuneration.\n\nThe Board has prepared a Remuneration Report to be submitted to the 2021 AGM that describes how the remuneration guidelines, adopted by the 2020 AGM, have been implemented in 2020. The Remuneration Report also provides information on the remuneration to the CEO and a summary of Investor's outstanding long-term variable remuneration programs. The Remuneration Report can be found on the website.\n\nThe Board's proposal regarding long-term variable remuneration programs to the 2021 AGM are substantially the same as the programs decided by the 2020 AGM. See note 11, Employees and personnel costs, as well as the Remuneration Report and the AGM documentation on the website for description on the long-term variable remuneration programs.\n\n## Deviation from the Code\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration program for employees within Patricia Industries has the purpose that employees within Patricia Industries should have a long-term variable remuneration directly aligned with the value creation within the business area Patricia Industries. The program is based on the same structure as Investor's program for long-term variable remuneration and contains corresponding performance criteria, but the outcome is depending on the development of the underlying assets of Patricia Industries. Since these assets are not listed, the total cost of the program, which is cash- settled, cannot in an efficient way be capped by hedging arrangements. In order for the program to correspond as closely as possible and create a corresponding incentive profile as the Investor program, the total outcome for each individual participant in the program is limited by a maximum number of instruments that can be allocated, but not by any other type of predetermined limit. To the extent the program is not compliant with previous Code rule 9.5, i.e. that variable remuneration paid in cash should be subject to a pre-determined limit, this is consequently a deviation from the Code for the above stated reasons.\n\nSimilarly, the Extended Management Group member Noah Walley's rights under the old variable remuneration programs for IGC are not subject to any predetermined limit. To the extent these programs are not compliant with the above-mentioned Code rule, this is also a deviation from the Code. The reason for such deviation is that the Board has considered that Noah Walley's already agreed rights should be honored and remain valid also after his appointment to the Extended Management Group. (In January 2021 Investor announced that Noah Walley will leave his position as Co-Head of Patricia Industries.)",

        "page_content": "## The Board of Director's report on Internal control over financial reporting\n\nInvestor's internal control over the financial reporting is focused primarily on ensuring efficient and reliable control of, and accounting for purchases, sales and valuation of securities as well as correct consolidation of the operating subsidiaries.\n\nThe Board and Management of each operating subsidiary is responsible for ensuring the efficiency of the subsidiary's internal control structures, risk management and financial reporting. Patricia Industries' Board representative provides this information to Patricia Industries' Board, where analysis and follow-up take place. Patricia Industries' Board ensures that Investor's Board and Management receive information on any issues that could affect Investor's business or financial reporting.\n\nThis description of the internal control over the financial reporting is based on the framework set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe control environment is built around an organization with clear decision-making channels, powers and responsibilities and a corporate culture based on shared values. It also requires each individual's awareness of his/her role in maintaining effective internal control.\n\nAll of Investor's business areas have policies, instructions and detailed process descriptions. These documents establish responsibilities for specific tasks, mandates and powers and how validation is to be carried out. Accounting and reporting rules and routines are documented in Investor's Financial Handbook. All gover ning documents are presented on the intranet for all employees. The documents are updated yearly or when needed. During 2020 the control functions have, among other things, followed up the portfolio companies' policy frameworks, with specific focus on the proactive work including internal controls in the financial processes to prevent corruption and bribery.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment is conducted continuously in the day to day business at Investor. Annually, the Finance department and the subsidiaries assess risk for major errors in the financial reporting and sets action plans to reduce identified risks. Focus is placed on significant Income Statement and Balance Sheet items, which have a higher risk because of the complexity, or where there is a risk that the effects of a potential error may become significant because of the high transaction values involved. Conclusions drawn from the risk assessments on risks for errors in the financial reporting 2020 have been reported to and discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nUsing the risk assessment as a starting point to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting, the Audit and Risk Committee determines which of the identified risks should be prioritized by the Internal Control function. Suggestions for improvements are identified and implemented on an ongoing basis.\n\nFor a more detailed description of risks and other risk assessments, see note 3, Risks and Risk management.\n\n## Control activities\n\nTo ensure that the financial reporting gives a true and fair picture on each reporting date, every process incorporates a number of control activities. These involve all levels of the organization, from the Board and Management to other employees.\n\nFinancial controls in the company include approval of business transactions, reconciliation with external counter parties, daily monitoring of risk exposure, daily account reconciliation, monthly custody reconciliation, performance monitoring and analytical monitoring of decisions. Investor's financial reports are analyzed and validated by the company's control function within Finance. Frequent analysis of the operating subsidiaries' financial reports are also performed. During 2020 the documentation of key controls in the financial reporting process has been a special focus area due to the more digitalized way of working under the covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nFor the purpose of ensuring that the external information is correct, complete and timely, Investor's Board has adopted a Communication Policy. Within the company, there are also instructions regarding information security and how to communicate financial information between the Board, Management and other employees as well as from Patricia Industries to Investor. The Finance department is responsible for ensuring uniform application of the Group's principles and instructions for the financial reporting. Finance identifies and communicates continuously improvement areas in the financial reporting to all subsidiaries.\n\nInvestor has an established external process for whistleblowing, accessible for all employees on the intranet and for external stakeholders on Investor's website. It can be used anonymously. Also the subsidiaries have established whistleblowing channels that can be used anonymously.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nBoth the Board and the Management Group regularly follow up on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls to ensure the quality of processes for the financial reporting. Investor's financial situation and strategy regarding the company's financial position are discussed at every Board meeting and the Board is provided with detailed reports on the development of the business to this end. The Board reviews all interim reports before public release.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee plays an important role in ensuring and monitoring that control activities are in place for important areas of risk inherent in the processes for financial reporting and regularly reports the results from the committee work to the Board. During 2020 the Audit and Risk Committee has specifically followed up on the subsidiaries' financial reporting regarding challenges related to the covid-19 pandemic. The Audit and Risk Committee, Management Group and the Internal Control function regularly follow up reported deviations.",

        "page_content": "## Guidelines for remuneration for the President and other members of the Extended Management Group (Remuneration Policy), adopted at the 2020 AGM\n\nThe President and other members of the Extended Management Group fall within the provisions of these guidelines. The guidelines are forwardlooking, i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual  General Meeting 2020. These guidelines do not apply to remuneration decided by the general meeting as is the case with the programs for longterm variable remuneration.\n\n## The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\n\nInvestor's business model is to be an engaged longterm owner. Through substantial ownership and board participation, we drive the initiatives that we believe will create the most value for each individual company. For more information regarding Investor's business model, please see www.investorab.com.\n\nA prerequisite for the successful implementation of our business strategy and safeguarding of Investor's long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that we are able to recruit and retain qualified people. To this end, it is necessary that Investor offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the Company to offer the President and other members of the Extended Management Group a competitive total remuneration.\n\nPrograms for long-term variable remuneration have been implemented in Investor. Such programs are resolved by the general meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. For all employees within Investor there is a Stock Matching Plan and for Senior Management there is a PerformanceBased Share Program. The performance criteria used for the Performance-Based Share Program is the total return on the Investor share during a threeyear period as this provides a clear link to Investor's business model and thus to the shareholders' longterm value creation. As from 2017, a new program was introduced for employees within Patricia Industries, meaning that employees within Patricia Industries since then are not included in Investor's program for long-term variable remuneration. The performance criteria used for the long-term variable remuneration program within Patricia Industries are related to the value growth of Patricia Industries' portfolio. This provides exposure to both value increases and value decreases within existing and future investments made by Patricia Industries. Accordingly, there is a clear link to Investor's business model and thus to the shareholders' long-term value creation. Both Investor's and Patricia Industries' programs for long-term variable remuneration are conditional upon the employee's own investment in Investor shares and holding of three years. For more information regarding these programs, including the criteria on which the outcome depends, please see www.investorab.com.\n\n## Types of remuneration, etc.\n\nThe remuneration shall be competitive and in line with market conditions and may consist of the following components: Fixed cash remuneration, shortterm variable remuneration, pension and other benefits. Long-term variable remuneration is also included in the total remuneration. Long-term variable remuneration is decided by the general meeting and is, as mentioned, therefore not covered by these guidelines.\n\n## Fixed cash remuneration\n\nFixed cash remuneration shall be reviewed annually and constitutes the basis for calculation of the variable remuneration.\n\n## Short-term variable remuneration\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration for the President may amount to not more than 30 percent of the fixed annual cash remuneration. For other members of the Extended Management Group, the short-term variable remuneration may amount to not more than 75 percent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\nFurther remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such extraordinary arrangements are applied on an individual basis only, either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives, or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 percent of the fixed annual cash remuneration. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of  Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration  Committee.\n\n## Pension\n\nPension benefits, including health insurance, shall be premium defined. Variable remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 50 percent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\n## Other benefits\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, medical insurance and domestic services. Such benefits may amount to not more than 20 percent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\nFor employments governed by rules other than Swedish, the components of the total remuneration may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\n## Termination of employment\n\nUpon termination of an employment, the notice period may not exceed six months. Fixed cash remuneration during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to two years fixed cash remuneration. When termination is made by the executive, the period of notice may not exceed six months and there is no entitlement to any severance pay. In addition, any noncompete undertakings may be compensated by remuneration for loss of income (compared to the fixed cash remuneration) for a maximum of six months following the termination of employment. This is not applicable, however, when severance is paid.\n\n## Criteria for awarding short-term variable remuneration, etc.\n\nShort-term variable remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability. The short-term variable remuneration shall be dependent upon the individual's satisfaction of annually set criteria. In that way the remuneration is clearly related to the work contributions and performance of the individual. The criteria can be financial or non-financial, qualitative or quantitative, and shall be based on factors which support Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by for example being clearly linked to value creation, engaged long-term ownership and Investor's development.\n\nThe outcome of the short-term variable remuneration is reviewed annually. To which extent the criteria for awarding short-term variable remuneration have been satisfied shall be evaluated when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation. For the President, the short-term variable remuneration is then confirmed by the Board of Directors.\n\nInvestor shall have the possibility, under applicable law or contractual provisions, subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract, to reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back).\n\n## Remuneration and employment conditions for employees\n\nIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines, remuneration and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total remuneration, the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time, in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate. The development of the gap between the remuneration to the President and the other members of the Extended Management Group and remuneration to other employees will be disclosed in the remuneration report.\n\n## The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for remuneration to the President and the other members of the Extended Management Group. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the President and the other members of the Extended Management Group, the application of the guidelines for remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in Investor. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of Investor and its Management. The President and the other members of the Extended Management Group do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.\n\n## Deviation from the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve Investor's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure Investor's financial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nFor further information on remuneration, see Investor's Annual Report and Investor's website, www. investorab.com.",

The Administration Report for the Group and the Parent Company gives a true and fair view of the operations, position and results, and describes significant risks and uncertainty factors that the  Parent Company and Group companies face. The annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements were approved for release by the Board of Directors and the President on March 22, 2021. The consolidated Income Statement and Balance Sheet, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet of the Parent Company, will be presented for adoption by the Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2021.\n\n## To be allocated as follows:\n\n| Dividend to shareholders, SEK 14.00 per share   | 10,740,450,420 1)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Funds to be carried forward                     | 316,269,177,937     |\n| Total SEK                                       | 327,009,628,357     |\n\nThe proposed dividend amounts to SEK 10,740m. The Group's equity attributable to the shareholders of the Parent Company was SEK 461,837m as of December 31, 2020, and unrestricted equity in the Parent Company was SEK 327,010m. Unrestricted equity includes SEK 247,597m attributable to unrealized changes in value according to a valuation at fair value. With reference to the above, and to other information that has come to the knowledge of the board, it is the opinion of the board that the proposed dividend is defendable with reference to the demands that the nature, scope and risks of Investor's operations place on the size of the company's and the Group's equity, and the company's and the Group's consolidation needs, liquidity and position in general.\n\n- 1)  Calculated on the total number of registered shares. No dividend is paid for the Parent Company's holding of own shares, whose exact number is determined on the record date for cash payment of the dividend. On December 31, 2020, the Parent Company's holding of own shares totaled 1,363,280. The proposed dividend is proposed to be paid in two installments, with SEK 10.00 per share in May, 2021 and SEK 4.00 per share, (or SEK 1.00 per share after implementation of the split 4:1 proposed by the Board of Directors to the Annual General Meeting), in November, 2021.\n\nStockholm, March 22, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMagdalena Gerger\n\nTom Johnstone, CBE\n\nDirector\n\nDirector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Audit Report was submitted on March 22, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGunnar Brock\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohan Forssell\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer",

Significant accounting policies for the Parent Company can be found on page 105.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. In addition the Swedish rules, RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Policies for Groups, was applied.\n\n## Basis of preparation for the Parent Company and consolidated financial statements\n\nThe financial statements are presented in SEK, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company. All amounts, unless otherwise stated, are rounded to the nearest million (SEK m). Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout these consolidated financial statements may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\nThe majority of the consolidated assets are financial assets and the majority of these as well as the majority of the real estate property within the Group are measured at fair value. Other assets and liabilities are in essence measured at historical cost.\n\nNon-current assets and non-current liabilities consist primarily of amounts that are expected to be settled more than 12 months from the Balance Sheet date. Other assets and liabilities are presented as current assets and current liabilities.\n\nThe accounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless otherwise noted. The accounting policies have also been consistently applied to the reporting and consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries and associates.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified in order to conform to the presentation of the current year's financial statements. In cases where reclassifications pertains to significant amounts, special information has been provided.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe following is a description of the revised accounting policies applied by the Group and Parent Company as of January 1, 2020.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies due to new or amended IFRS\n\nFrom January 1, 2020 there was amendments to IFRS 3 Business combinations related to the definition of a Business and to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to clarify the definition of material. These amendments have had no significant impact on the Group's reporting.\n\nAmendments have also been adopted in IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 due to phase 1 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The amendments provide certain temporary reliefs in relation to specific requirements in hedge accounting and have the effect for the Group that the reforms have not caused hedge accounting to terminate.\n\n## New IFRS regulations and interpretations to be applied in 2021 or later\n\nThere are no mandatory known changes to IFRS and IFRIC to be applied in the future that are expected to have any significant impact on the Group's reporting.\n\nFrom January 1, 2021 amendments have been made to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS\n\n7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 due to phase 2 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\n\nThe amendments mainly relate to exceptions in relation to termination of hedge accounting and modifications of financial assets and liabilities directly affected by inter-bank offered rate (IBOR) reform. In addition there will be new disclosure requirements.\n\n## Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise of the Parent Company, subsidiaries and associates.\n\n- \u00b7 Subsidiaries are companies over which Investor AB have control. When determining if control is present, power and ability to affect the amount of returns are considered, but also de facto control. Subsidiaries are reported in accordance with the acquisition method. For further information see note P7, Participations in Group companies.\n\n- \u00b7 Associates are companies in which Investor has a significant influence, typically between 20 and 50 percent of the votes. Accounting for associates is dependent on how Investor controls and monitors the companies' operations. For further information see note 20, Shares and participations in associates.\n\nIntra-group receivables, payables and transactions as well as gains arising from transactions with associates, that are consolidated using the equity method, are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\n## Translation to functional currency\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate in existence on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate in existence on the balance sheet date, except for non-monetary assets and liabilities which are recognized at historical cost using the exchange rate in existence on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on translation are recognized in the income statement with the exception of effects from cash-flow hedges, see note 31, Financial Instruments.\n\n## Financial statements of foreign operations\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and other consolidated surpluses/deficits are translated to SEK using the exchange rate in existence on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses in a foreign operation are translated to SEK using an average exchange rate that approximates the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Translation differences arising when translating foreign operations are recognized directly in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the translation reserve, which is a separate component of equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following symbols IS and BS show which amounts in the notes that can be found in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet.\n\n## Note 2 Critical estimates and key judgments\n\nIn order to close the books and prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the amounts recognized for assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nEstimates and judgments are based on historical experience, market information and assumptions that management considers to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and the actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made.\n\n## Judgments in relation to the application of accounting policies\n\nWithin the scope of IFRS, there are some instances where management must either choose between accounting policies, or choose whether to apply a particular accounting policy, in order to provide a fair view of the Group's activities. The development relating to accounting and the choice of policies are discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nSignificant items for which a special judgment has been made in order to define the Group's accounting policies are presented below.\n\n|                                                        | Judgments                       | See note   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|\n| Participations in   Group companies                    | Control over investment or not  | Note P7    |\n| Participations in associates                           | Fair value or equity method     | Note 20    |\n| Owner-occupied property                                | Revaluation or cost model       | Note 17    |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities   and related derivatives | Application of hedge accounting | Note 31    |\n| Disposal of subsidiary                                 | Discontinued operation or not   | Note 6     |\n\n## Important sources of uncertainty in estimates\n\nThe most significant estimation uncertainties in relation to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented on the next page.

The main financial risks that the Investor Group is exposed to is market risks. Derivative instruments are used to manage financial risks. All derivative transactions are handled in accordance with established policies and procedures.\n\nRisk measurement is performed daily regarding the Treasury and Trading businesses and provided to Investor's Management. Financial reports are compiled monthly and followed-up by Management. Yearly a more comprehensive risk assessment is performed.\n\nThe Board follows up frequently on limits and risk exposure to ensure the ability to reach business strategies and goals. There has been no significant change in the measurement and follow-up of risks compared with the preceding year.\n\nThe financial risks in the subsidiaries are managed by each subsidiary's Finance function and reported to respective board.\n\n## Market risks\n\nMarket risks refer to the risk of a change in value of a financial instrument because of changes in share prices, exchange rates or interest rates.\n\n## Share price risk\n\nInvestor's most significant risk is share price risk. The majority of Investor's share price risk exposure is concentrated to Listed Companies. At year-end 2020, Listed Companies accounted for 76 percent of total assets of reported values (80). The companies and their share prices are analyzed and continuously monitored by Investor's analysts. Thus, a large portion of share price exposure in Listed Companies does not necessarily lead to any action. It is the longterm commitment that lays the groundwork for Investor's strategic measures. Investor does not have defined goals for share price risks, as share prices are affected by short term fluctuations. The share price risk for Listed Companies is not hedged. If the market value of Listed Companies was to decline by 10 percent, the impact on income and equity would be SEK -36.7bn (-34.5).\n\nPatricia Industries including wholly-owned subsidiaries, Three Scandinavia and financial investments, but excluding  Patricia Industries' cash, accounted for 12 percent of total assets of reported values (12). There is no share price risk associated with the wholly-owned subsidiaries. However, Patricia Industries' listed financial investments face a share price risk. A 10 percent decline in share prices for the financial investments would imply a loss of SEK -0.1m (-0.1).\n\n## Note 3 Financial risks and risk management\n\nThe investment in EQT AB is listed and as such exposed to share price risk. The EQT fund investments are partly exposed to share price risk. The total EQT investment accounted for 12 percent of total assets of reported values (9) as per year-end 2020. Should the market value and the valuation parameters, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, decline with 10 percent, the impact on the values of the total EQT investment would be SEK -5.7bn (-3.7).\n\nInvestor has a trading operation for the purpose of executing Listed Companies transactions and obtaining market information. The trading operation conducts short-term equity trading and deals in equity derivatives (primarily for hedging market risk in the portfolio). The market risk in this activity is measured and monitored in terms of cash delta. Limits on gross, net and maximum position size are measured as well as liquidity risk. At year-end 2020, the trading operation accounted for less than 0.5 percent of total assets of reported values (0.5). If the market value of the assets belonging to the trading operation were to decline by 10 percent, the impact on income would be SEK -1.3m (-3.3).\n\n## Listed holdings in all business areas\n\nListed holdings in all business areas account for 84 percent of total assets of reported values (84). If the market value of listed holdings in all business areas were to decline by 10 percent, the impact on income and equity would be SEK -40.5bn (-36.4), which equals 8.8 percent of Investor's reported net asset value (8.7). Market risks associated with listed shares constitute the greatest risk for Investor.\n\n## Exchange rate risk\n\nCurrency exposure arises from cash flows in foreign currencies (transaction exposure), the translation of Balance Sheet items to foreign currencies (balance sheet exposure) and the translation of foreign subsidiaries' Balance Sheets and Income Statements to the Groups accounting currency (translation exposure).\n\n## Balance sheet exposure\n\nSince the majority of Listed Companies are listed in SEK, there is a limited direct exchange rate risk that affects Investor's Balance Sheet. However, Investor is indirectly exposed to exchange rate risks in Listed Companies that are listed on foreign stock exchanges or that have foreign currency as their pricing currency. In addition, there are indirectly exchange rate risks since the majority of the companies in the Listed Companies business area are active in several markets. These risks have a direct impact on the respective companies' Balance Sheet and Income Statement, which indirectly affects valuation of the shares.\n\nThe wholly-owned subsidiaries are exposed to exchange rate risks in businesses and investments made in foreign companies. Also the EQT fund investment is exposed to exchange rate risks.\n\nThere is no regular hedging of foreign currency since the investment horizon is long-term and currency fluctuations are expected to equal out over time. This hedging policy is subject to continuous evaluation and deviations from the policy may be allowed if judged beneficial from a market economic perspective.\n\nExchange rate risks for investments in the trading operation are minimized through currency derivative contracts at the portfolio level.\n\nTotal currency exposure for the Investor Group is provided in the table below. If the SEK were to appreciate 10 percent against the EUR (holding all other f  actors constant), the impact after hedges on income and equity would be SEK -0.3bn (-0.7). If the SEK were to appreciate 10 percent against the USD (holding all other factors constant), the impact after hedges on income and equity would be SEK -3.9bn (-3.9).\n\n| Gross exposure in           | Gross assets   | Gross assets   | Gross liabilities   | Gross liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| foreign currencies, SEK m   | 12/31 2020     | 12/31 2019     | 12/31 2020          | 12/31 2019          |\n| EUR                         | 61,554         | 57,674         | -60,673             | -52,316             |\n| USD                         | 66,523         | 56,247         | -28,781             | -17,830             |\n| Other European and          |                |                |                     |                     |\n| North American   currencies | 13,868         | 10,517         | -7,847              | -7,525              |\n| Asian currencies            | 2,978          | 2,705          | -3,497              | -3,661              |\n| Total                       | 144,923        | 127,142        | -100,797            | -81,332             |\n\nExchange rate risk in excess liquidity on group level resulting from investments in foreign currency is managed through currency derivative contracts.\n\nExchange rate risk arising in connection with loans in foreign currency is managed by, among other things, exchanging the loans to SEK through currency swap contracts. The objective is to minimize the exchange rate risk in excess liquidity and the debt portfolio. This strategy is applied considering the holdings in foreign currency.\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nP5\n\nP6\n\nP7\n\nP8\n\nP9\n\nP10\n\nP11\n\nP12\n\nP13\n\nP14\n\nP15\n\nP16\n\nP17\n\nP18",

Limits for the major currencies EUR and USD, on outstanding exposure at a specific time, have been set by the Board. Cash flows in other foreign currencies exceeding SEK 50m are to be hedged. As per year-end there was no such hedge outstanding.\n\nGroup companies with larger transaction exposure in foreign currencies are M\u00f6lnlycke and  Permobil. M\u00f6lnlycke's operational cash flows in foreign currency are estimated at the equivalent of EUR 422m (457), corresponding to SEK 4.4bn (4.8), for the next 12 months. These cash flows are normally not hedged. However this year M\u00f6lnlycke have had specific unusual currency cash flows and these have been hedged. At year-end 2020 M\u00f6lnlycke had outstanding currency forwards and swaps corresponding to a nominal amount of EUR 104m. Forwards with longest term ends in May 2021. For outstanding currency hedging as of December 31, 2020, an immediate 10 percent rise in the value of each currency against the EUR would impact net income by EUR 30m during the next 12 month period (9.2). Permobil's operational cash flows in foreign currency are estimated to corresponding SEK 1,174m for the coming 12 months (727). These cashflows are not hedged. An immediate 10 percent rise in the value of each currency against the SEK would impact net income for  Permobil by SEK 117m (61) and other comprehensive income with SEK 28m the coming 12 months (4).\n\nCurrency exposure associated with net investments in foreign operations Currency exposure associated with investments made in independent foreign entities is considered as a translation risk and not an economic risk. The exposure arises when the foreign net investment is translated to SEK on the balance sheet date and it is recognized in the translation reserve under equity. To reduce such currency exposure Investor targets primarily to neutralize net investments in foreign currencies with loans in the same currency. Remaining currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations is normally not hedged.\n\nThe table below show the exposure, in main currencies, arising from net investments in foreign subsidiaries (in investment currency).\n\n| Currency exposure in equity   | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| EUR m                         | 3,664        | 3,149        |\n| GBP m                         | 306          | 279          |\n| USD m                         | 2,200        | 1,997        |\n\nIf the SEK were to appreciate by 10 percent this would decrease equity by SEK -6.9bn due to translation effects of currency exposure in net investments in foreign subsidiaries (-6.0).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk is primarily associated with long-term borrowings. In order to minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations, limits and instructions have been established for example regarding fixed interest rate periods.\n\n## Excess liquidity and debt portfolio\n\nInvestor AB's Treasury manages interest rate risks, exchange rate risks, liquidity risks and financing risks associated with the administration of the excess liquidity portfolio and financing activities.\n\nFor excess liquidity exposed to interest rate risks, the aim is to limit interest rate risks firstly and secondly to maximize return within the established guidelines of the risk policy. High financial flexibility is also strived for in order to satisfy future liquidity needs. Investments are therefore made in interest-bearing securities of short duration and high liquidity. For further information, see note 21, Other financial investments, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. A one percentage point parallel movement upward of the yield curve would reduce the value of the portfolio and affect the Income Statement by SEK -204m (-189).\n\nOn the liability side, Investor strives to manage interest rate risks by having an interest rate fixing tenor within the established limits and instructions of the Risk Policy. Fixed rates are established to provide flexibility to change the loan portfolio in step with investment activities and to minimize volatility in the cash flow over time. Investor uses derivatives to hedge against interest rate risks (related to both fair value and cash flow fluctuations) in the debt portfolio. Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but are still grouped together with loans since the intention of the derivative is to achieve the desired fixed-interest term for each loan. The total outstanding carrying amount of hedged loans, including fair value hedge adjustment, was at year-end SEK 10,683m (11,308).\n\nThe table below shows the value of all interest rate derivatives by the end of 2020. The effect of fair value hedges is recognized in the Income Statement. The remaining maturities of fair value hedges vary between 1 and 17 years. For further information on the maturity structure, see schedule, 'Investor AB's debt maturity profile'.\n\n| Interest rate derivatives,   | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2020     | 12/31 2019   | 12/31 2019     |\n|------------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| fair value hedges, SEK m     | Fair value   | Nominal amount | Fair value   | Nominal amount |\n| Assets                       | 2,037        | 10,426         | 2,653        | 11,007         |\n| Liabilities                  | -328         | -898           | -324         | -1,852         |\n| Interest rate derivatives,   | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2020     | 12/31 2019   | 12/31 2019     |\n| cash flow hedges, SEK m      | Fair value   | Nominal amount | Fair value   | Nominal amount |\n| Assets                       | -            | -              | -            | -              |\n| Liabilities                  | -155         | -3,060         | -22          | -3,587         |\n\nFor more information on financial instruments and hedge accounting, see note 31, Financial instruments.\n\nThe table below shows the effect of a parallel movement of the yield curve up with one percentage point (100 basis points) for the Group's fair value loans and derivatives.\n\n|                                                                      | 12/31 2020                     | 12/31 2020                             | 12/31 2019                     | 12/31 2019                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Interest sensitivity of loans  and derivatives at fair  value, SEK m | Effect on   income   statement | Effect on other  comprehensive  income | Effect on   income   statement | Effect on other  comprehensive  income |\n| Hedged loans                                                         | -1,003                         | 0                                      | -1,292                         | -                                      |\n| Swaps for hedges                                                     | 1,127                          | 64                                     | 1,289                          | 90                                     |\n| Other swaps                                                          | -22                            | 0                                      | -28                            | -                                      |\n| Net interest rate  sensitivity                                       | 102                            | 64                                     | -31                            | 90                                     |\n\nThe interest cost effect related to instruments with floating interest is nonmaterial at a parallel movement of the yield curve with one percentage point.\n\n## Liquidity and financing risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that a financial instrument cannot be divested without considerable extra costs, and to the risk that liquidity will not be available to meet payment commitments.\n\nLiquidity risks are reduced in Treasury operations by limiting the maturity of short-term cash investments and by ensuring that cash and committed credit lines always exceed short-term debt, i e a liquidity ratio higher than one. Liquid funds are invested in deposit markets and short-term interest-bearing securities with low risk and high liquidity. In other words, they are invested in a wellfunctioning second-hand market, allowing conversion to cash when needed. Liquidity risk in the trading operations is restricted via limits established by the Board.\n\nFinancing risks are defined as the risk that financing can not be obtained, or can only be obtained at increased costs as a result of changed conditions in the capital market. To reduce the effect of refinancing risks, limits are set regarding average maturities for loans. In order to minimize financing risks, Treasury works actively to ensure financial preparedness by establishing loan and credit limits for both long-term and short-term borrowing. Financing risks are further reduced by allocating loan maturities over time (please refer to the chart on the next page) and by diversifying sources of capital. An important aspect, in this context, is the ambition to have a long-term borrowing profile. Furthermore, proactive liquidity- planning efforts also help limit both liquidity and financing risk.",

The program is for EUR 5.0bn (SEK 50.2bn), of which EUR 3.8bn (SEK 38.6bn) has been utilized.\n\n16 Mkr \u00c5r For short-term financing, Investor has an uncommitted Swedish and a European Commercial Paper program (CP/ECP) for SEK 10.0bn and USD 1.5bn (SEK 12.3bn), respectively. At year-end 2020 these facilities were unutilized.\n\n5 000 6 000 7 000 8 000 10 14 12 Investor has a committed syndicated bank loan facility of SEK 10.0bn. This facility is available until 2024. The facility was unutilized at year-end. In contrast to an uncommitted credit facility, a committed loan program is a formalized commitment from the credit grantor. There are no financial covenants in any of Investor AB's loan contracts, meaning that  Investor does not have to meet special requirements with regard to key financial ratios for the loans it has obtained.\n\n2 000 3 000 4 000 4 6 8 The wholly-owned subsidiaries ensure their financial preparedness by keeping credit facilities, should there be a need for additional working capital or minor acquisitions. The terms of the credit facilities require the companies to meet a number of covenants.

As per year-end the subsidiaries fulfilled their covenants.\n\n1 000 2 With an equity/assets ratio of 81 percent at year-end (81), Investor has considerable financial flexibility, since leverage is low and most assets are highly liquid.\n\n0 2037 2039 2044 2036 2035 2033 2029 2023 2022 2021 2030 2034 0 The following table shows the Group's contracted cash flow of loans including other financial payment commitments and derivatives.\n\n|                                                                   | F\u00f6rfallostruktur, nominellt v\u00e4rde, Mkr 12/31 2020   | F\u00f6rfallostruktur, nominellt v\u00e4rde, Mkr 12/31 2020   | Genomsnittligt f\u00f6rfall, \u00e5r 12/31 2019              | Genomsnittligt f\u00f6rfall, \u00e5r 12/31 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Cash flow of financial  liabilities and deriva- tives  1) , SEK m | Loans and other financial debts  and   commitments  | Derivatives                                         | Loans and other financial debts  and   commitments | Derivatives                             |\n| < 6 months                                                        | -5,456                                              | 146                                                 | -5,348                                             | 159                                     |\n| 6-12 months                                                       | -745                                                | -18                                                 | -1,202                                             | 119                                     |\n| 1-2 years                                                         | -9,158                                              | 221                                                 | -9,651                                             | 382                                     |\n| 2-5 years                                                         | -38,786                                             | 501                                                 | -33,009                                            | 619                                     |\n| > 5 years                                                         | -49,100                                             | 1,683                                               | -44,397                                            | 2,578                                   |\n\nFor information on the Group's excess liquidity and how it is invested, see note 21, Other financial investments, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nExposure from guarantees and other contingent liabilities also constitutes a liquidity risk. For such exposure as per December 31, 2020, see note 32, Pledged assets and contingent liabilities.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of a counterparty or issuer being unable to repay a liability to Investor. Investor is exposed to credit risks primarily through investments of excess liquidity in interest-bearing securities, which all are market valued. Credit risks also arise as a result of positive market values in derivative instruments (mainly interest rate, currency swaps).\n\nInvestor applies a wide-ranging limit structure with regard to maturities, issuers and counterparties in order to limit credit risks on single counterparties. With a view to further limiting credit risks in interest rate and currency swaps, and other derivative transactions, agreements are established with counterparties in accordance with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), as well as netting agreements. Credit risk is monitored daily and the agreements with various counterparties are continuously analyzed.\n\nThe following table shows the total credit risk exposure by rating category as of December 31, 2020.\n\n| Exposure per rating category     | Nominal   amount,   SEK m   |   Average   remaining   maturity,   months |   Number of   counter-  parties |   Percentage   of the credit   risk exposure |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Swedish government  papers (AAA) | 3,400                       |                                        4.1 |                               1 |                                           10 |\n| AAA                              | 10,451                      |                                       10.3 |                              14 |                                           32 |\n| AA                               | 5,523                       |                                        0.6 |                              47 |                                           17 |\n| A                                | 10,513                      |                                        0.2 |                              57 |                                           32 |\n| Lower than A                     | 2,651                       |                                        4.2 |                              30 |                                            8 |\n| Total                            | 32,539                      |                                        4.2 |                             149 |                                          100 |\n\nThe total credit risk exposure at the end of 2020 amounted to SEK 32,539m (33,700). The credit risks resulting from positive market values for derivatives, which are included in the total credit risk, amounted to SEK 2,037m (2,653) and is reported in the Balance Sheet.\n\nThe credit risk in the wholly-owned subsidiaries relates mainly to trade account receivables. M\u00f6lnlycke's and Permobil's credit risks are limited due to the fact that a significant portion of their customers are public hospitals /care institutions.\n\nThe maximum exposure related to commercial credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of trade receivables. Assessment of expected losses is described in note 31, Financial instruments.\n\nThe following table shows the aging of trade receivables and other short-term receivables within the Group.\n\n|                             | 12/31 2020              | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019              | 12/31 2019   | 12/31 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Aging of receivables, SEK m | Gross  carrying  amount | Impair- ment | Net          | Gross  carrying  amount | Impair- ment | Net          |\n| Not past due                | 4,989                   | -9           | 4,980        | 4,063                   | -7           | 4,056        |\n| Past due 0-30 days          | 705                     | -6           | 699          | 702                     | -1           | 701          |\n| Past due 31-90 days         | 526                     | -4           | 522          | 356                     | -1           | 355          |\n| Past due 91-180 days        | 226                     | -4           | 221          | 165                     | -19          | 146          |\n| Past due 181-360 days       | 91                      | -46          | 45           | 61                      | -19          | 41           |\n| More than 360 days          | 98                      | -69          | 29           | 71                      | -38          | 33           |\n| Total                       | 6,635                   | -138         | 6,496        | 5,417                   | -85          | 5,332        |\n\n## Concentrations of credit risks\n\nConcentrations of risk are defined as individual positions or areas accounting for a significant portion of the total exposure to each area of risk.\n\nBecause of the global nature of its business and sector diversification, the Group does not have any specific customers representing a significant portion of receivables.\n\nThe concentration of credit risk exposure related to fair value reported items, is presented in the first table in this column. The secured bonds issued by Swedish mortgage institutions have the primary rating category of AAA. The proportion of AAA-rated instruments accounted for 43 percent of the total credit risk exposure (37).",

In the analysis, the fair value of the identifiable assets and the assumed liabilities is determined. For business combinations where the cost exceeds the net carrying amount of the acquired identifiable assets and the assumed liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill in the Balance Sheet. The purchase price allocation also identifies assets and liabilities that are not reported in the acquired company, such as trademarks and customer contracts. Identified intangible assets that have been identified when making the purchase price allocation are amortized over the estimated useful life. Goodwill and strong trademarks that are considered to have an indefinite useful life, are not amortized but tested annually for impairment, or whenever there is any indication of impairment.\n\nConsideration that is contingent upon the outcome of future events is valued at fair value and the change in value is recognized in the Income Statement.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are reported in the consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date and until the time when a controlling interest no longer exists.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nAt the time of an acquisition, the Group must choose to either recognize non-controlling interest at fair value, meaning that goodwill is included in the non-controlling interest or recognize the non-controlling interest as the share of the net identifiable assets. The Group have chosen to recognize the non-controlling interest as the share of the net identifiable assets for all acquisitions.\n\nIf a business combination achieved in stages results in a controlling influence, the prior acquired shares are revalued at fair value and the effect of the revaluation is recognized in the Income Statement. Acquisitions that are made subsequent to having obtained a controlling influence and divestments that do not result in a loss of the controlling influence are reported under equity as a transfer between equity attributable to the Parent Company's shareholders and non-controlling interests. For information regarding put options to non-controlling interests, see note 25, Equity.\n\n## Patricia Industries' acquisition of Advanced Instruments\n\nOn October 30, 2020, Patricia Industries, a part of Investor AB, acquired 98 percent of Advanced Instruments, the leading global provider of osmolality instrumentation and consumables for the clinical, biopharmaceutical and food & beverage markets.

Investor's presentation of operating segments corresponds to the internal structure for management and reporting.\n\nThe operations are divided into the three business areas Listed Companies, Patricia Industries and Investments in EQT.\n\nListed Companies consists of twelve listed holdings, see pages 18-23.\n\nPatricia Industries includes the wholly-owned subsidiaries, Three Scandinavia and the former IGC portfolio and all other financial investments, except Investor's trading portfolio, see pages 24-35.\n\nThe business area Investments in EQT consists of the holdings in EQT AB and the EQT funds, see page 36.\n\nThe reported items in the operating segment profit/loss for the year, assets and liabilities, are presented according to how they are reviewed by the CEO.\n\nIn the operating segment presentation, items directly attributable and items that can be reliably and fairly allocated to each respective segment are included. Non-allocated items are presented in Investor Groupwide and are related to the investing activities and consist, within profit/loss, of management costs, net financial items and components of tax. Assets and liabilities within investing activities are included in Investor Groupwide as well. Market prices are used for any transactions that occur between operating segments.\n\nFor information about goods, services and geographical areas, see note 8, Revenues.\n\n| Performance by business

A promised good or service is transferred when or as control transfers to the buyer. When or as performance obligations are satisfied, the transaction price that is allocated to that performance obligation is recognized as revenue. Details of performance obligations included in contracts and how transaction prices are determined and allocated to performance obligations, are presented under Performance obligations and Transaction prices on the next page. All revenues from contract with customers are related to the operating segment Patricia Industries.\n\n## Disaggregated revenues from contracts with customers into the field of operation\n\nRevenues from the sale of goods or services are disaggregated into the six field of operations Health care equipment, Health care services, Hotel, Real estate, Osmolality testing and Gripping and moving solutions.\n\n## Health care equipment\n\nThe majority of the revenues in the field of operations Health care equipment are derived from sale of single use products and solutions for managing wounds and preventing pressure ulcers.

The majority of the rental agreements are related to office premises.\n\nRental agreements are signed directly with the tenants and the revenue is recognized over the term of the contract.\n\n## Osmolality testing\n\nThe majority of the revenue within the field of operations Osmolality testing is earned from the sale of equipment and consumable supplies necessary to use the equipment. Customers can separately purchase maintenance contracts and revenue are also earned from servicing of customer equipment and repair calls not covered by maintenance contracts.\n\nRevenue from the sale of equipment and consumable supplies is generally recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer. Maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period and revenue from other service or repairment of equipment is recognized when the service is performed.\n\n## Gripping and moving solutions\n\nThe field of operations Gripping and moving solutions mainly generates revenue from the sale of finished products and customer-specific solutions. The finished products are vacuum pumps, vacuum accessories, vacuum conveyors and suction cups for a variety of automated material handling and factory automation processes. The customer-specific solutions are assembled to the specification of each customer and comprise of products and components in combination with services such as installation and training activities.\n\nRevenues are allocated to geographical area by the location of where the customer is resident. The sale channels are both through distributors and directly to customers and the revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time.\n\n## Performance obligations and Transaction prices\n\nRevenues from the sale of goods or services are derived from five relatively different fields of operations. Below details can be found about different types of performance obligations in the contracts from customers and information about how transaction prices are determined and allocated to performance obligations. The information is on an aggregated level based on different types of customer contracts.\n\n## Sale of finished products\n\nSale of finished products are by far the largest part of Investor's net sales. The products mainly relates to health care equipment but also products within osmolality testing and gripping and moving solutions. Performance obligations in the contracts with customers from sale of finished products mainly refers to goods manufactured by the selling company. A minor part of the performance obligations also relates to distribution of goods as retailer, products having a trial period and revenue from customer-specific solutions. The sales contracts can, to a limited extent, also include performance obligations related to various forms of services, for example extended warranty, service agreements, program management contracts and similar obligations.\n\nFor finished products the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the goods has transferred to the customer. The point in time is upon delivery to the customer or shipment of the goods, which is determined by the delivery terms of each contract. The evaluations in order to identify when a customer obtains control of promised goods is to a large extent based on the shipping terms. This is because shipping terms typically specifies when title passes and will also affect when risk and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer. For the majority of the sale, control is transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer.\n\nFor distribution of health care products as a retailer, control is transferred upon shipment from the distribution center. At this point in time, the performance obligation is fulfilled and revenue is recognized. For products having a trial period, the revenue is recognized at the expiration of the trial period.\n\nCustomer-specific solutions are mainly relevant within Gripping and moving solutions and represents one performance obligation as a bundle of goods and services, since the separate goods and services are not consid-\n\nered as distinct within the context of each contract. The performance obligation is satisfied over time since the asset is not created with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nThe selected method used to measure the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is the input method on the basis of cost incurred relative to the total expected costs for each customer-specific solution. Costs mainly include costs for labor and material. The input method is selected since the timing of the costs related to each customerspecific solution provides the best reflection of how control is transferred to the customer. The estimations related to revenue recognition from the input method require judgments that affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from customer-specific solutions. The initial estimate of total expected costs of each customer-specific solution is continuously controlled and updated if necessary.\n\nPayment terms varies normally from 30-60 days and could in some instances be up to 90 days. Hence, the contracts does not involve any significant financing component. For certain countries and customers, when deemed appropriate from a credit risk perspective, payment in advance is requested before delivery of goods.\n\nThe transaction price for finished products is typically based on a list price, but where a contract contains elements of variable rebates, right of returns, customer discounts or similar, revenue is recognized net after recognizing a refund liability for such variable considerations. Right of returns is adjusted based on its accumulated historical experience to estimate the number of returns. These variable considerations can be paid both quarterly and yearly dependent on customer contract. The customer accrual of yearly contracts will increase the liability until repayment, which usually takes place during Q1, then the liability will be significantly reduced compared to yearend.\n\n## Sale of services\n\nSales of services mainly relates to health care services, but also services related to hotel. The sale of products can, to a limited extent, also include performance obligations related to various forms of services, for example extended warranty, service agreements, program management contracts and similar obligations.\n\nWithin Health care each contract is a series of distinct services that are essentially the same and follow the same pattern. Therefore each contract are identified as one performance obligation. The services are mainly activities within primary medical care. Revenues consist of listing compensation, compensation per visit and percentage compensation regardless of how many visits. Revenues from Health care services are mainly recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the entity performs.\n\nPerformance obligations within hotel services mainly refers to accommodation and food & beverage. The different services are distinct and performance obligations recognized as revenue as the services are performed.\n\nThere are also performance obligations related to services connected with the sale of products, for example extended warranty, service agreements, program management contracts and similar obligations. Revenues are mainly recognized over time as the services are performed.\n\n## Contract balances\n\n|                                 |   2020 |   2019 |   Change |   % |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|-----|\n| Contract assets                 |      0 |      1 |       -1 | -98 |\n| Contract liabilities            |   -400 |   -145 |     -256 | 177 |\n| Net contract assets/liabilities |   -400 |   -143 |     -257 | 179 |\n\nContract assets are comprised of accrued revenue balances. Accrued revenue represents the right to consideration for goods and services that has been transferred to a customer, but payment has not yet been received.\n\nContract liabilities are an entity's obligation to transfer goods and services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. These are comprised of deposits and prepayments collected on orders that will be transferred in a future period. Other forms of contract liabilities are payments related to extended warranty contracts and program management contracts, which are deferred and recognized straight-line over the contract life.\n\n## Contract costs\n\nSince all sales commissions paid would have been amortized within one year, the practical expedient to recognize these costs as an expense when incurred is used. However an associated company, accounted for using the equity method, recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and the asset is amortized as the contracts are completed.",

When entering into a new lease contract the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. Short-term leases and leases of lowvalue assets are exempt and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAt the same time, a lease liability is recognized representing the obligation to pay lease payments for the leased assets. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. When discounting the lease payments, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used at first hand. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used.\n\nAfter the commencement date the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The value of the lease liability is mainly adjusted to reflect interest on the lease liability and to reflect the lease payments made.\n\nIn the Consolidated Balance Sheet the right-of-use assets connected to leases are included in the items Buildings and land and Machinery and equipment. The lease liability is included in Long-term interest-bearing liabilities and Current interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n## Lessor\n\nFor Investor as a lessor, leases are classified as operating leases. The lease contracts do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying assets. Lease payments from operating leases are recognized as income on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Information about lease contracts - Lessee\n\nLease contracts are related to vehicles, office equipment and rental agreements regarding offices, warehouses and factory buildings.\n\nLeasing contracts for vehicles do normally not include any extension options. Outstanding leasing agreements for offices, warehouses and factories include various extension and termination options, as well as contracts that are automatically extended for a certain period if not actively being canceled.\n\nWhen determining the lease term, extension options are considered. If no plan is initiated to move to another building six months before notice must be given, to not have the contract automatically extended, the extension option is included in the lease period. For other leased buildings individual assessments of the current lease term is made on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Lease amounts for the period - Lessee\n\n|                                                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Disclosures related to the financial performance                  |        |        |\n| - Depreciation charge for right-of-use buildings                  | -352   | -494   |\n| -  Depreciation charge for right-of-use machinery   and equipment | -109   | -99    |\n| - Interest expense on lease liabilities                           | -78    | -106   |\n| - Expense relating to short-term leases                           | -27    | -30    |\n| - Expense relating to low-value leases                            | -7     | -18    |\n| - Expense relating to variable lease payments                     | -6     | -9     |\n| Disclosures related to cash flows                                 |        |        |\n| - Cash outflow for leases, Interest                               | -78    | -106   |\n| - Cash outflow for leases, Payment of lease liability             | -429   | -616   |\n| - Cash outflow for leases, Low value and short-term               | -34    | -44    |\n| Disclosures related to the financial position                     |        |        |\n| -  Carrying amount of right-of-use asset as per December          |        |        |\n| 31, included in:                                                  |        |        |\n| Buildings and land                                                | 1,860  | 1,789  |\n| Machinery and equipment                                           | 214    | 189    |\n| - Lease liability as per December 31, included in:                |        |        |\n| Long-term interest-bearing liabilities                            | 1,706  | 1,611  |\n| Current interest-bearing liabilities                              | 392    | 391    |\n\n## Information about lease contracts - Lessor\n\nLease contracts are mainly related to rental agreements regarding premises and housing.

        "page_content": "## Note 11 Employees and personnel costs\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAccounting policies on employee benefits such as short-term benefits, termination benefits and share-based payment transactions are presented below. Post-employment benefits are presented in note 27, Provisions for pensions and similar obligations.\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related services are provided. A provision is made for the anticipated cost of variable cash salary and profit-sharing contracts when the Group has a current obligation to make such payments (because services have been provided by employees) and when the obligation can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nThe cost of termination benefits is recognized only if the company is demonstrably committed (without any realistic possibility of withdrawing the commitment) by a formal plan to prematurely terminate an employee's employment.\n\n## Share-based payment transactions\n\nWithin the Investor Group both equity-settled and cash-settled stock option and share programs and cash-settled (synthetic) shares have been issued.\n\n## Accounting for equity-settled programs\n\nThe fair value of stock options and share programs issued is determined at the grant date in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation model, taking into consideration the terms and conditions that are related to the share price.\n\nThe value is recognized in the income statement as a personnel cost allocated over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nThe recognized cost corresponds to the fair value of the estimated number of options and shares that are expected to vest. This cost is adjusted in subsequent periods to reflect the actual number of vested options and shares. However, no adjustment is made when options and shares expire only because share price related conditions do not reach the level needed for the options to vest.\n\nWhen equity-settled programs are exercised, shares are delivered to the employee. The delivered shares are treasury shares that are repurchased when needed. When exercised, the payment of the exercise price that was received from the employee is reported as an increase in equity.\n\nEquity-settled programs issued to employees in Group companies In the Parent Company, the value of equity instruments, which is offered to employees of other companies belonging to the Group, is reported as a capital contribution to subsidiaries. The value of participations in subsidiaries increases simultaneously to the Parent Company's reporting of an increase in equity. The costs related to employees in companies concerned are invoiced to the subsidiaries. The cash settlement of the invoices then neutralizes the increase of participations in subsidiaries.\n\n## Accounting for cash-settled programs\n\nCash-settled stock option and share programs and cash-settled (synthetic) shares result in an obligation that is valued at fair value and recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities. Initial fair value is calculated and the grant value is recognized over the vesting period as a personnel cost, which is similar to the recognition of  equity -settled programs. However, cash settled programs are revalued at fair value every balance sheet date and at final settlement. All changes in the fair value as a result of changes in share price or fair value of the underlying instruments are recognized in the financial net with a corresponding change in liabilities.\n\nWhen cash-settled programs are exercised, the liability to the holder of the synthetic shares is settled.\n\nAccounting for social security attributable to share-based payment transactions\n\nSocial security expenses attributable to share-based remuneration are recognized and accrued in accordance with the same principles as the costs for synthetic shares.\n\n## Guidelines for remuneration for the President and other Members of the Extended Management Group\n\nThe AGM 2020 decided on guidelines for remuneration for the President and other Members of the Extended Management Group. The complete guidelines can be found on page 52.\n\n## Average number of employees in the Group\n\n|                              | 2020   | 2020            | 2019   | 2019            |\n|------------------------------|--------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|\n|                              | Total  | Of which  women | Total  | Of which  women |\n| Parent Company, Sweden       | 71     | 36              | 72     | 37              |\n| Sweden, excl.

Through the long-term variable remuneration programs, part of the remuneration to employees becomes linked to the long-term performance of the  Investor share. Investor has two programs for long-term variable remuneration: Investor's program and the program for Patricia Industries.\n\n## Investor's program for long-term variable remuneration\n\nThe program consists of the following two components:\n\n## 1) Stock Matching Plan\n\nThrough the Stock Matching Plan, an employee could acquire or commit shares in Investor (Matching share) at the market price during a period (determined by the Board) subsequent to the release of Investor's first quarterly report for each year, respectively (the 'Measurement Period'). After a three-year vesting period, two options (Matching Options) are granted for each Investor share acquired or committed by the employee, as well as a right to acquire one Investor share (Matching Share) for SEK 10. The Matching Share may be acquired during a four-year period subsequent to the vesting period. Each Matching Option entitles the holder to purchase one Investor share, during the corresponding period, at a strike price corresponding to 120 percent of the average volumeweighted price paid for Investor shares during the Measurement Period.\n\nThe President, other members of the Extended Management Group and a maximum of 20 other executives within Investor ('Senior Management') are required to participate in the Stock Matching Plan with Participation Shares corresponding to a 'Participation Value' of at least 5 percent of their fixed cash remuneration before taxes. 'Participation Value' refers to the number of Participation Shares multiplied by the Participation Price.\n\nIn addition, Senior Management is offered to participate with Participation Shares to such an extent that the value of the allocated Matching Options and Matching Shares amounts to a maximum of between 10 and approximately 27 percent (for the President, approximately 32 percent) of their respective annual fixed cash remuneration before taxes, depending on position, performance, etc. Other employees are not obligated, but have a right, to participate with Participation Shares to an extent that the value of the allotted Matching Options and Matching Shares amounts to a maximum of 10 or 15 percent of fixed cash remuneration depending on position, performance, etc.\n\nUnder the Stock Matching Plan, the President is entitled to participate with (invest in) Participation Shares corresponding to a Participation Value of up to 40 percent of the annual fixed cash remuneration before taxes. If the President\n\nparticipates fully in the Stock Matching Plan, the possibility to receive a Matching Shares and Matching Options under the Stock Matching Plan corresponds to a theoretical value of approximately 27 percent of the annual fixed cash remuneration before taxes.\n\n## 2)  Performance Plan\n\nSenior Management has, in addition to the Stock Matching Plan, the right to participate in a Performance Plan. Under this program, which presumes participation in the Stock Matching Plan, Senior Management, after a three-year vesting period, has the right during a period of four years thereafter, to acquire additional Investor shares of class B ('Performance Shares') at a price corresponding to 50 percent of the Participation Price conditional upon the total return on the Investor shares exceeding a certain level during the vesting period. The total return is measured during a three-year qualification period (quarterly measurement on running 12-month basis where the total outcome is estimated as the average total return during the three years based on 9 measurement points). In order to give the participants the right to acquire the maximum number of Performance Shares, the average annual total return of the Investor share (including reinvested dividends) must exceed the interest on 10-year government bonds by more than 10 percentage points. If the total return does not exceed the 10-year interest on government bonds by at least 2 percentage points, then Senior Management is not entitled to acquire any Performance Shares. If the total return is between the 10-year interest on government bonds plus 2 percentage points and the 10-year interest on government bonds plus 10 percentage points, then a proportional (linear) calculation of the number of shares that may be acquired shall be made. The theoretical value of the opportunity to acquire Performance Shares for Senior Management shall amount to between 20 and approximately 53 percent of the respective Senior Manager's fixed cash remuneration for 2020 (for the President, approximately 53 percent).\n\n## Dividend adjustment\n\nWhen the Matching Shares and Performance Shares are acquired, the employee receives compensation for dividends paid during the vesting period and up to the date of acquisition in order for the program to be dividend neutral.\n\nHedge contracts for employee stock option and share programs Investor's policy is to implement measures to minimize the effects on equity from the programs in the event of an increase in Investor's share price. For programs implemented in 2006 and later, Investor has previously been repurchasing its own shares in order to guarantee delivery.\n\n## Summary of Investor's long-term share-based variable remuneration programs 2014-2020\n\nMatching Shares 2014-2020\n\n| Year  issued   | Number   of Matching  Shares granted   | Number at  the beginning  of the year   | Adjustment   for dividend  2020   | Matching   Shares   forfeited   in 2020   | Matching  Shares   exercised   in 2020   | Weighted   average   share price   on exercise   | Number of  Matching  Shares  at year-end   | Theoretical value  1) ,  SEK   | Fair value  2) , SEK   | Strike price,   SEK   | Maturity date   | Vesting   period (years) 3)   |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2020           | 28,089                                 | -                                       | -                                 | 156                                       | 52                                       | 575.60                                           | 27,881 4)                                  | 467.93                         | 516.96                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2026      | 3                             |\n| 2019           | 32,671                                 | 32,651                                  | 581                               | 1,047                                     | 221                                      | 574.68                                           | 31,964 4)                                  | 379.81                         | 422.53                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2025      | 3                             |\n| 2018           | 32,172                                 | 31,655                                  | 557                               | 1,389                                     | 278                                      | 574.77                                           | 30,545 4)                                  | 333.01                         | 370.47                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2024      | 3                             |\n| 2017           | 28,482                                 | 28,330                                  | 380                               | 24                                        | 9,996                                    | 540.17                                           | 18,690                                     | 355.53                         | 395.69                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2023      | 3                             |\n| 2016           | 49,948                                 | 38,575                                  | 618                               | -                                         | 26,410                                   | 567.27                                           | 12,783                                     | 246.40                         | 274.01                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2022      | 3                             |\n| 2015           | 37,671                                 | 26,721                                  | 302                               | -                                         | 19,838                                   | 556.94                                           | 7,185                                      | 293.33                         | 326.18                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2021      | 3                             |\n| 2014           | 55,451                                 | 26,568                                  | 398                               | -                                         | 26,962                                   | 536.23                                           | 4                                          | 219.51                         | 244.29                 | 10.00                 | 12/31 2020      | 3                             |\n| Total          | 264,484                                | 184,500                                 | 2,836                             | 2,616                                     | 83,757                                   |                                                  | 129,052                                    |                                |                        |                       |                 |                               |\n\n- 2) The fair value on the grant date was calculated in accordance with IFRS 2, which was also used for calculating recognized value.

When estimating the fair value in accordance\n\nwith IFRS 2, personnel turnover is not taken into account; instead the anticipated number of vested shares or options is adjusted. The adjustment is based on average historical outcome.\n\nThe calculation of the fair value on the grant date, according to IFRS 2, was based on the following conditions:\n\n|                                                           | 2020             | 2020              | 2020                | 2019             | 2019              | 2019                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                           | Matching   Share | Matching   Option | Performance   Share | Matching   Share | Matching   Option | Performance   Share |\n| Averaged volume-weighted price paid for Investor B shares | 527.17           | 527.17            | 527.17              | 432.71           | 432.71            | 432.71              |\n| Strike price                                              | 10.00            | 632.60            | 263.59              | 10.00            | 519.20            | 216.36              |\n| Assumed volatility 1)                                     | 21%              | 21%               | 21%                 | 21%              | 21%               | 21%                 |\n| Assumed average term 2)                                   | 5 years          | 5 years           | 5 years             | 5 years          | 5 years           | 5 years             |\n| Assumed percentage of dividend 3)                         | 0%               | 2.9%              | 0%                  | 0%               | 3.3%              | 0%                  |\n| Risk-free interest                                        | -0.32%           | -0.32%            | -0.32%              | -0.39%           | -0.39%            | -0.39%              |\n| Expected outcome 4)                                       |                  |                   | 50%                 |                  |                   | 50%                 |\n\n## Patricia Industries' program for long-term variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Board of Directors' ambition to continuously ensure a strong alignment between the variable remuneration of employees of Patricia Industries ('PI') and the value creation in the PI portfolio. The purpose of the PI program is to encourage employees to build up significant economic holdings in Investor shares as well as, directly or indirectly, in existing and future investments made by PI.\n\nIn summary, the PI program is built on the same structure as the Investor program, but is related to the value growth of PI. The instruments in the PI program are granted under two different Plans, as further described below: (i) The PI Balance Sheet Plan (the 'PI-BS Plan') and (ii) The PI North America Subsidiaries Plan (the 'PI-NA Plan'). The instruments have a duration of up to seven years and participants are granted, conditional upon making a personal investment in Investor shares or the use of already held Investor shares, instruments that vest after a three-year vesting period and may be exercised and/or settled during the four-year period thereafter (subject to applicable US tax laws).\n\nTwo categories of employees are offered to participate in the PI program: (i) PI Senior Management and (ii) Other PI Employees. Participants employed within the PI Nordic organization are only offered to participate in the PI-BS Plan whereas participants employed within the PI North America organization are offered to participate with 60 percent of their grant value (determined as described below) in the PI-BS Plan and 40 percent of their grant value in the PI-NA Plan.\n\n## General terms of instruments\n\nThe instruments granted under the PI-BS Plan and the PI-NA Plan are governed by the following terms and conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Granted free of charge.\n- \u00b7 Instruments granted to Other PI Employees under the two Plans will replicate the structure of the Stock Matching Plan in Investor.\n- \u00b7 Instruments granted to PI Senior Management under the two Plans consists both of instruments replicating the Stock Matching Plan in Investor and instruments subject to specific performance conditions replicating the structure of the Performance Plan in Investor.\n- \u00b7 Vest three years after grant (the 'Vesting Period').\n- \u00b7 May not be transferred or pledged.\n- \u00b7 Subject to vesting, the instruments may be exercised and/or settled during the four-year period following the end of the Vesting Period, subject to applicable\n\n- US tax laws and provided that the participant, with certain exceptions, maintains the employment with PI and keeps the Participation Shares during the Vesting Period.\n- \u00b7 Cash-settled.\n- \u00b7 Participants receive remuneration for dividends paid from time of grant up to the date of exercise and/or settlement in order for the PI program to be dividend neutral.\n\n## Specific performance conditions for PI Senior Management\n\nThe following performance conditions apply to the instruments under the PI program allocated to PI Senior Management (replicating the structure of the Performance Plan in Investor).\n\nInstruments granted under the PI-BS Plan: In order for participants to be awarded the maximum number of instruments, the compounded annual growth of the fair market value of PI's balance sheet must exceed the interest on 10-year Swedish government bonds by more than 10 percentage points. If the compounded annual growth of the fair market value of PI's balance sheet does not exceed the 10-year interest on Swedish government bonds by at least 2 percentage points, then participants will not be awarded any instruments. If the applicable compounded annual growth is between the 10-year interest on Swedish government bonds plus 2 percentage points and the 10-year interest on Swedish government bonds plus 10 percentage points, then a proportional (linear) calculation of the award shall be made. Performance is measured three times during the three-year Vesting Period, each measurement on a running 12-month basis.\n\nInstruments granted under the PI-NA Plan: In order for participants to be awarded the maximum number of instruments the compounded annual growth of the North American operating subsidiaries of PI must exceed the interest on 10-year US government bonds by more than 12 percentage points. If the compounded annual growth of the fair market value of the North American operating subsidiaries of PI does not exceed the 10-year interest on US government bonds by at least 4 percentage points, then participants will not be awarded any instruments. If the applicable compounded annual growth is between the 10-year interest on US government bonds plus 4 percentage points and the 10-year interest on US government bonds plus 12 percentage points, then a proportional (linear) calculation of the award shall be made. Performance is measured once, at the end of the three-year Vesting Period.",

During the year, a total of SEK 19m was paid out to employees from this program (6), where of SEK 9m to member of the Extended Management Group in Investor (3). The provision (not paid out) on unrealized gains amounted to SEK 66m at year-end (42), where of SEK 31m to member of the Extended Management Group in Investor (20).\n\n## Incentive programs in Patricia Industries' subsidiaries\n\nSenior executives and selected senior staff in BraunAbility, Laborie and Sarnova, are offered the opportunity to invest in Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Options in the respective subsidiary. These instruments are mainly cash settled and the participants do not need to make any initial investment.\n\n## Management Participation Programs\n\nBoard members and senior executives in unlisted investments, including M\u00f6lnlycke, Permobil, Piab, Vectura, BraunAbility, Sarnova and Laborie are offered the opportunity to invest in the companies through management participation programs or similar. The terms of the programs are based on market valuations and are designed to yield lower return to the participants than that of the owners if the investment plan is not reached but higher return to the participants than that of the owners if the plan is exceeded.\n\n## Profit-sharing program for the trading operation\n\nThis program includes participants both from the trading organization and the investment organization. The participants in this program receive, in addition to their base salary, a variable salary equivalent to 20 percent of the trading function's net result. The program includes a clawback principle by which 50 percent of the variable salary allotment is withheld for one year and will only be paid out in full if the trading result for that year is positive. In order to receive full allotment, two consecutive profitable years are required. In total, approximately 10-15 employees participate in the program.\n\n## Accounting effects of share-based payment transactions\n\n| Costs relating to share-based payment transactions, SEK m           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Group                                                               |        |        |\n| Costs relating to equity-settled share-based   payment transactions | 52     | 62     |\n| Costs relating to cash-settled share-based   payment transactions   | 74     | 206    |\n| Social security relating to share-based   payment transactions      | 112    | 87     |\n| Total                                                               | 238    | 355    |\n| Parent Company                                                      |        |        |\n| Costs relating to equity-settled share-based   payment transactions | 28     | 26     |\n| Costs relating to cash-settled share-based   payment transactions   | 12     | 14     |\n| Social security relating to share-based   payment transactions      | 47     | 48     |\n| Total                                                               | 87     | 88     |\n| Other effects of share-based payment transactions, SEK m            | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Group                                                               |        |        |\n| Effect on equity relating to Stock-Options   exercised by employees | 85     | 48     |\n| Carrying amount of liability relating to   cash-settled instruments | 401    | 403    |\n| Parent Company                                                      |        |        |\n| Effect on equity relating to Stock-Options   exercised by employees | 85     | 48     |\n| Carrying amount of liability relating to   cash-settled instruments | 38     | 32     |",

AGM's decision regarding synthetic shares 2020 is essentially identical to the decision of the AGM 2019. In 2020, Board members were entitled to receive 50 percent of the proposed remuneration before tax, excluding remuneration for committee work, in the form of synthetic shares and 50 percent in cash (instead of receiving 100 percent of the remuneration in cash). A synthetic share carries the same economic rights as a class B Investor share, which means that the value of the Board of Director's remuneration in synthetic shares, just like for class B shares, is dependent upon value fluctuations as well as the amount of dividends during the five-year period until 2025, when each synthetic share entitles the Board member to receive an amount corresponding to the share\n\nprice, at the time, of a class B Investor share. At the statutory meeting in May 2020 the Board approved, as in 2019, establishment of a policy pursuant to which members of the Board (who do not already have such holdings) are expected to, over a five-year period, acquire ownership in Investor shares (or a corresponding exposure to the  Investor share, for example in synthetic shares) for a market value that is expected to correspond to at least one year's remuneration for board work, before taxes and excluding remuneration for committee work.\n\nThe Director's right to receive payment occurs after the publications of the year-end report and the three interim reports, respectively, during the fifth year following the general meeting which resolved on the allocation of the Synthetic Shares, with 25 percent of the allocated Synthetic Shares on each occasion. In case the Director resigns as Board member prior to a payment date the Director has a right, within three months after the Director's resignation, to request that the time of payment shall be brought forward, and instead shall occur, in relation to 25 percent of the total number of allocated Synthetic Shares, after the publications of each of the year-end report and the three interim reports, respectively, which are made during the year after the year when such request was received by the Company.\n\n## Expensed remuneration to the Board 2020\n\nEffect\n\nNumber of\n\n| Total

The work includes the audit of the annual report and consolidated financial statements and the accounting, the administration of the Board of Directors and the CEO and remunerations for audit advice offered in connection with the audit assignment.\n\nOther audit activities refers to other assignments, other consultations or other assistance which the entity's auditors perform as a result of observations during the audit.\n\n## Note 13 Net financial items\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFinancial income and financial expenses consist mainly of interest, exchange rate differences on financial items and changes in the value of financial investments, liabilities and derivatives used to finance operations.\n\nInterest is calculated using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future payments or receipts throughout the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Transaction costs, including issuing costs, are expensed as incurred. When valued at amortized cost, amortization takes place over the remaining life using the effective interest rate. Borrowing costs are recognized in profit/loss using the effective interest rate method except to the extent that they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that take considerable time to prepare for their intended use or sale. In such cases, they are included in the acquisition cost of the asset. Costs related to unused credit facilities are recognized as interest and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the facilities. Other financial items consist mainly of changes in the value of derivatives and loans that are subject to fair value hedging, and foreign currency result.\n\n|                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest                    |        |        |\n| Interest income             | 13     | 35     |\n| Interest expense            | -2,170 | -2,282 |\n| Total interest              | -2,158 | -2,248 |\n| Other financial items       |        |        |\n| Changes in value, gains     | 165    | 130    |\n| Changes in value, losses    | 1,035  | -      |\n| Exchange loss               | -      | -197   |\n| Other items                 | -1,015 | -660   |\n| Total other financial items | 185    | -727   |\n| IS  Net financial items     | -1,973 | -2,975 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther financial items consists of unrealized market value changes and realized results of financial items excluding interest. Net financial items include the changes in value attributable to long-term share-based remuneration SEK -98m (-74) and revaluations of financial assets and liabilities established with valuation techniques totaling SEK 165m (130). Liabilities accounted for as hedges have been revalued by SEK 33m (-247) and the associated hedging instruments have been revalued by SEK -12m (346). Derivatives included in cash flow hedges are not recognized in the Income Statement but have affected Other Comprehensive income by SEK -161m (-22). In Other items the revaluation effect of put options to non-controlling interests are included with SEK -997m (-420). For more information about net financial items, see note 31, Financial instruments.\n\n## Note 14 Income tax\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe amount reported as the Group's total income tax for the year consists of current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is tax that must be paid or refunds that will be received for the current year and adjustments to current tax attributable to earlier periods. Deferred tax is based on the temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount. Temporary differences attributable to goodwill are not recognized. Furthermore, temporary differences attributable to investments in subsidiaries or associates are not recognized unless they are expected to reverse within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on the extent to which underlying assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates and tax regulations that have been decided at year-end. If the calculations result in a deferred tax asset, it will only be reported as such if it is probable that it will be realized.\n\nIncome taxes are reported in the Income Statement unless the underlying transaction is reported as part of Other Comprehensive income or as a component of equity. In such cases, the associated tax effect is also reported as part of Other Comprehensive income or as a component of equity.\n\nPart of the difference between the effective tax rate and the Parent Company's tax rate that occurs upon reconciliation is due to the fact that the Parent Company is taxed in accordance with the rules that apply to industrial holding companies.\n\nFor a description of matters relating to tax contingencies, see note 32, Pledged assets and contingent liabilities.\n\n## Information about the connection between tax expense for the period and reported profit/loss before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                       | 2020 (%)   | 2020         | 2019 (%)   | 2019    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|------------|---------|\n| Reported profit/loss before tax                                                       |            | 53,125       |            | 102,650 |\n| Tax according to applicable tax rate                                                  |            | 21.4 -11,369 | 21.4       | -21,967 |\n| Tax effect of other tax rates in other   jurisdictions                                | 0.1        | -50          | 0.2        | -214    |\n| Tax from previous years                                                               | -0.9       | 470          | 0.0        | 35      |\n| Tax effect of non-taxable income                                                      | -24.7      | 13,106       | -24.6      | 25,274  |\n| Tax effect status as an industrial   holding company 1)                               | -2.0       | 1,050        | -0.5       | 508     |\n| Tax effect of non-deductible expenses                                                 | 5.3        | -2,837       | 4.4        | -4,478  |\n| Controlled Foreign Company taxation                                                   | 0.0        | -6           | 0.0        | -       |\n| Standard interest on tax allocation  reserves                                         | 0.0        | -1           | 0.0        | 0       |\n| Tax effect of not recognized losses or   temporary differences                        | 1.5        | -812         | 0.5        | -485    |\n| Tax effect of recognition and derecognition   of tax losses and temporary differences | 1.4        | -729         | 0.4        | -429    |\n| Other                                                                                 | 0.0        | 3            | 0.0        | 15      |\n| Current tax expense                                                                   | 2.2        | -1,176       | 1.7        | -1,740  |\n| Tax effect of recognition and derecognition   of tax losses and temporary differences | -1.4       | 729          | -0.4       | 428     |\n| Tax effect of not recognized losses or   temporary differences                        | -0.1       | 29           | 0.1        | -92     |\n| Tax effect of changed tax rates                                                       | 0.1        | -44          | 0.0        | -4      |\n| Tax effect impairment of goodwill                                                     | 0.0        | -            | 0.0        | -       |\n| Other                                                                                 | 0.0        | -2           | 0.0        | 0       |\n| Deferred tax income                                                                   | -1.3       | 713          | -0.3       | 332     |\n| IS  Reported tax expense                                                              | 0.9        | -463         | 1.4        | -1,408  |\n\n## Income tax for the year in Other Comprehensive income\n\n|                                                       |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income tax for the year in Other Comprehensive income |     61 |    -17 |\n| Total                                                 |     61 |    -17 |",

When calculating diluted earnings per share, the average number of shares is adjusted to take into account the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, originating during the reported periods from stock option and share programs that have been offered to employees. Dilutions from stock option and share programs affect the number of shares and only occur when the strike price is less than the share price. The potential ordinary shares are not viewed as dilutive if they would result in better earnings per share after dilution, which occurs when net income is negative.\n\n## Basic earnings per share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                      | 2020   | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Profit/loss for the year attributable to the holders of ordinary shares in the Parent Company, SEK m | 52,790 | 101,226 |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, millions                     | 765.5  | 765.2   |\n| IS  Basic earnings per share, SEK                                                                    | 68.96  | 132.29  |\n| Change in the number of outstanding shares, before dilution                                          | 2020   | 2019    |\n| Total number of outstanding shares   at beginning of the year, millions                              | 765.3  | 765.1   |\n| Repurchase of own shares during the year, millions                                                   | 0.0    | 0.0     |\n| Sales own shares during the year, millions                                                           | 0.5    | 0.3     |\n| Total number of outstanding shares   at year-end, millions                                           | 765.8  | 765.3   |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                                           |        |         |\n|                                                                                                      | 2020   | 2019    |\n| Profit for the year attributable to the holders   of ordinary shares in the Parent Company, SEK m    | 52,790 | 101,226 |\n| Weighted average number   of outstanding ordinary shares, millions                                   | 765.5  | 765.2   |\n| Effect of issued: Employee share and stock option programs, millions                                 | 0.5    | 0.5     |\n| Number of shares used for the calculation of   diluted earnings per share, millions                  | 766.0  | 765.7   |\n| IS  Diluted earnings per share, SEK                                                                  | 68.92  | 132.20  |\n\n## Instruments that are potentially dilutive in the future and changes after the balance sheet date\n\nOutstanding options and shares in long-term share-based programs are to be considered dilutive only if earnings per share was less after than before dilution. Some options are out of money due to a lower average share price (SEK 527.69) compared to exercise price and potential value per option to be expensed in accordance to IFRS 2. Finally there are Performance Shares for which performance terms and conditions are to be met before they can be dilutive. See note 11, Employees and personnel costs, for exercise price and a description of performance terms and conditions.\n\n## Note 16 Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIntangible assets, except for goodwill and tradenames with indefinite life, are reported at cost after a deduction for accumulated amortization or any impairment losses. Goodwill and the majority of the Groups tradenames have an indefinite life and are reported at cost after any impairment losses.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises when the acquisition cost in a business combination exceeds the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities according to the purchase price allocation.\n\n## Tradenames and Trademarks\n\nTradenames and trademarks are valued as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from a third party. The tradenames and trademarks must have long-term value and it must be possible to sell them separately.\n\n## Capitalized development expenditure\n\nCosts attributable to the development of qualifying assets are capitalized as a component of the asset's acquisition cost. An internally generated intangible asset is reported by the Group only if all of the following apply; it is possible to identify the asset that was created, it is both technically and financially feasible to complete the asset, there is both intent and ability to use the asset, it is likely that the asset will generate future economic benefits and it is possible to calculate the expenses in a reliable way. Amortization of the asset begins as soon as it is put into use. All other expenditure is immediately recognized in the Income Statement.\n\n## Proprietary technology\n\nProprietary technology consists of assets such as patents and licenses and is valued as part of the fair value of acquired businesses.\n\n## Customer contracts and relations\n\nCustomer contracts and relations are valued as part of the fair value of acquired businesses (less any amortization or impairment losses). The useful life of these assets are sometimes long, which reflects the long-term nature of the underlying business. Customer contracts and relations are based on the period of time over which net payments are expected to be received from the contract, as well as legal and financial factors.\n\n## Software\n\nCosts for software intended for own administrative use are recognized as an asset in the Balance Sheet when the costs are expected to generate future economic benefits in the form of more efficient processes. Capitalized expenditure for software is amortized from the date it became available for use.\n\n## Amortizations\n\nAmortizations are made linearly over the asset's estimated useful life. Goodwill and tradenames with an indefinite useful life are not amortized.\n\nEstimated useful lives:\n\n| Trademarks                          | 3-15 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Capitalized development expenditure | 3-8 years    |\n| Proprietary technology              | 5-20 years   |\n| Customer contracts and relations    | 4-18 years   |\n| Software and other                  | 1-10 years   |\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is calculated whenever there is an indication of impairment. The recoverable amount is calculated once per year or more often if there are any indications of impairment for goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less selling expenses and the value-in-use. When determining the value-in-use, future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that takes into account the risk-free interest rate and risk associated with the specific asset. An impairment loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The loss is reported in the Income Statement.",

Investor makes regular tests to determine that the carrying values of these assets do not exceed the value in use. The method for impairment testing is based on a discounted cash flow forecast to determine the value in use. Various assumptions are used to suit the different companies and its business. The calculated value in use is then compared to the carrying amount.\n\n## Value in use\n\nValue in use is calculated as Investors share of present value of future estimated cash flow generated from the subsidiaries. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon reasonable assumptions and best knowledge of the company and future economic conditions. The base for the estimate is an assumption of the future growth rate, budgets and forecasts. The chosen discount factor reflects specific risks that are assignable to the asset and marketable assessments of the time value of money. The base for calculation of the discount rate is the company's weighted average cost of capital, where the assumption of the risk free interest rate, market risk premium, leverage, cost of debt and relevant tax rate are important components. The ambition is to use a discount rate which is not dependent on short term market sentiment, but instead reflects a long-term cost of capital corresponding to Investor's long-term investment horizon.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe estimated value for each cash-generating entity is based on a value in use calculation in which assumptions of future growth rate and operating margins are important components. The estimated value in use is based on the budget\n\nfor the coming year and financial forecasts for the four years after that (or a longer period if deemed more relevant). Operating margin in the value in use calculations reflect management's past experience together with reasonable assumptions and best knowledge of the company and future economic conditions.\n\nA growth rate of 1.8-2.6 percent has been used to extrapolate the cash flows for the years beyond the forecast period (1.7-2.9 percent in previous year impairment test). The growth-rate is individual for each entity and is considered reasonable given the company's historical growth, geographical positioning and industry fundamentals. A sector's long-term growth drivers, such as demographics and lifestyle aspects can be considered as well.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nDuring 2020, the global economy, financial markets and societies have been significantly impacted by covid-19. For Investor, the impact has been uneven, with some companies being severely negatively affected, while others have been much more resilient. In June 2020, Investor performed sensitivity analysis for all cash-generating entities with intangible assets with indefinite useful life. The sensitivity analysis was based on the annual impairment tests for 2019, updated with revised forecasts due to covid-19. As for the impairment tests 2019, the sensitivity analysis for all companies except from Piab proved significant headroom in relation to the carrying amount. Since covid-19 has had a significant negative impact on the demand for Piab's products, a new valuation was done to capture the revised forecast for 2020 and onwards. The updated valuation indicated a headroom in line with the 2019 impairment test despite the downturn. In the annual impairment test for 2020, the value in use for Piab is significantly higher than the carrying amount and for all entities the assessment is that no reasonably possible change in any key assumption will lead to a calculated recoverable amount that is lower than the carrying amount.\n\n| 12/31 2020            | Amount of   Goodwill SEK m   | Amount of   Tradenames SEK m 1)   | Valuation method   | Budget for   | Financial   forecasts   until   | Growth rate   beyond forecast   period   | Discount rate   (pre tax)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Cash Generating Units |                              |                                   |                    |              |                                 |                                          |                             |\n| M\u00f6lnlycke             | 22,741                       | 5,154                             | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 1.8                                      | 10.0                        |\n| Laborie               | 6,162                        | 160                               | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 2.2                                      | 9.4                         |\n| Sarnova               | 5,870                        | 686                               | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 2.5                                      | 9.1                         |\n| Piab                  | 4,065                        | 1,045                             | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 2.6                                      | 9.5                         |\n| Permobil              | 3,124                        | 1,443                             | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 2.2                                      | 9.8                         |\n| Advanced Instruments  | 2,859                        | 434                               | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 2.6                                      | 9.4                         |\n| BraunAbility          | 1,668                        | 245                               | Value in use       | 2021         | 2025                            | 2.2                                      | 10.4                        |\n| Other 2)              | 198                          | -

Cost includes the original purchase price and directly attributable costs, including borrowing costs, required to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. Property consist of parts with different useful lives (such as the framework, land, roof and basic installations), the parts are treated as separate components of property.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the company and if the cost can be measured reliably. All other subsequent costs are expensed in the period they arise. A subsequent expenditure is capitalized if the expenditure is a replacement of an identified component or if a new component is added. Any undepreciated carrying amount of replaced components, or parts of components, are retired and expensed in connection with the exchange. Repairs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Revaluation model\n\nOwner-occupied property, whose fair value can be measured reliably, is recognized according to the revaluation model less accumulated depreciation and revaluation adjustments. Property is revalued with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the amount established as fair value on the balance sheet date. When an asset's carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase is reported in Other Comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity, called the Revaluation reserve. When an asset's carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation and there is a balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to the asset, the decrease in value is recognized in Other Comprehensive income and the amount in the revaluation reserve is also decreased.\n\nThe difference between depreciation based on the revalued amount, and depreciation based on the original cost, is transferred from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings.\n\nAt the time of a revaluation the accumulated depreciation is recalculated in proportion to the change in the asset's increased cost so that the carrying amount of the asset (the net of the adjusted cost and adjusted depreciation) after revaluation corresponds to the revalued amount. When an asset is divested, the value attributable to the asset in the revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings, without having any effect on profit/loss or Other Comprehensive income.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is made linearly over the asset's estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated.\n\nEstimated useful lives:\n\nFrameworks\n\n25-100 years\n\nLand improvements\n\n15-40 years\n\nBuilding components 2-50 years\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is calculated whenever there is an indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount and there is no value relating to the asset to release from the revaluation reserve.\n\n## Valuation of owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model\n\nOwner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model is classified in level 3, according to the definition in IFRS 13. Property valuations are regularly conducted by external appraisers. Fair value has been determined based on current market prices for comparable properties and by using a return model based on a calculation of the present value of future cash flows.\n\nThe discount rate has been estimated at 5.42-5.65 percent (5.52-5.75) and consists of an estimated long-term inflation rate of 2 percent, a risk-free longterm real rate of interest and a risk premium. Payments for operations and maintenance have been assessed following the rate of inflation during the calculation period.\n\nThe residual value has been assessed by the long-term, normalized net operating income for the year after the calculation period divided by an estimated long-term yield. The long-term yield requirement has been assessed to be in a span of 3.52 percent to 3.75 percent (3.52-3.75). Value determined on an earnings basis nominal development during the calculation period will then be around 2 percent.\n\nAll valuations in level 3 are based on assumptions and judgments that management consider to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made. The valuation of owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model is dependent on the level of the discount rate and the long-term yield requirement. A 0.5 percentage point change of the discount rate would have an effect on the value of the owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model of SEK 178m (173). Respectively a 0.5 percentage point change of the long-term yield requirement would have an effect on the value of SEK 453m (439).\n\nThe majority of the properties was revalued during 2020.

All investment property is measured using the fair value model. Changes in the fair value are recognized in profit/loss for the year.\n\nThe market value of each property is assessed individually by external valuers. The valuation method uses a 10-15 year cash flow analysis, based on the property's net operating income. Opening value-impacting factors, such as yield requirement, are assessed using the location-based pricing method. The location's market rental rate and long-term vacancy rate are also assessed. Each property is assessed using property-specific valueimpacting events, such as newly signed and renegotiated lease agreements, terminated leases and investments. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. Changes to the unobservable inputs used in the valuations during the period are analyzed by management at each closing date against internally available information, information from completed and planned transactions and information from external sources. The valuation method therefore complies with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.\n\n| Amounts recognized in profit and loss statement                                                                   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rental income                                                                                                     |    127 |     79 |\n| Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that  generated rental income during the period        |    -32 |    -16 |\n| Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that  did not generate rental income during the period |      0 |     -1 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Major changes during the previous reporting period\n\nSeveral properties had a change in use in January, 2019. The main reason for the change was the sale of Aleris care operations. Previously all properties was classified as owner-occupied property, but from January, 2019 several properties are classified as investment property due to having external lessees. The effect of this change is that properties with a value of SEK 1,794m have been reclassified from owner-occupied property to investment property.\n\n## Fair value measurement of Investment Property\n\nThe discount rate has been estimated at 4.25-7.0 percent (4.5-6.5) and consists of an estimated long-term inflation rate of 2 percent, a risk-free long-term real rate of interest and a risk premium. Payments for operations and maintenance have been assessed following the rate of inflation during the calculation period.\n\nThe residual value has been assessed by the long-term, normalized net operating income for the year after the calculation period divided by an estimated long-term yield. The long-term yield requirement has been assessed to be in a span of 3.9 percent to 6.0 percent (4.0-7.15). Value determined on an earnings basis nominal development during the calculation period will then be around 2 percent.\n\nAll valuations in level 3 are based on assumptions and judgments that management consider to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made. The valuation of owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model is dependent on the level of the discount rate and the long-term yield requirement. A 0.5 percentage point change of the discount rate would have an effect on the value of the owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model of SEK 164m (101). Respectively a 0.5 percentage point change of the long-term yield requirement would have an effect on the value of SEK 218m (136). All properties was revalued during 2020.\n\n|                                               | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2020                | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   | 12/31 2019                | 12/31 2019   | 12/31 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                               | Buildings    | Buildings                 |              |              | Buildings    | Buildings                 |              |              |\n|                                               | Buildings    | Construction in  progress | Land         | Total        | Buildings    | Construction in  progress | Land         | Total        |\n| Opening balance                               | 1,749        | 669                       | 442          | 2,861        | -            | -                         | -            | -            |\n| Reclassification from owner-occupied property |              |                           |              |              | 1,039        | 356                       | 399          | 1,794        |\n| Business Combinations                         |              |                           |              |              | 101          |                           | 16           | 117          |\n| Other acquisitions                            | 730          | 359                       | 740          | 1,830        | 10           | 680                       | 29           | 718          |\n| Sales and disposals                           | -214         |                           | -29          | -243         |              | -3                        | -7           | -10          |\n| Reclassifications                             | 658          | -766                      | 82           | -26          | 345          | -364                      | 17           | -2           |\n| Effect of revaluation                         | 489          |                           | -134         | 356          | 255          |                           | -12          | 243          |\n| BS  Carrying amount at year-end               | 3,413        | 262                       | 1,101        | 4,777        | 1,749        | 669                       | 442          | 2,861        |",

Accounting for associates is dependent on how Investor controls and monitors the companies' operations. The Group applies the equity method for unlisted holdings in those cases where Investor is significantly involved in the associate's operations.\n\nCertain unlisted associates within Patricia Industries and all listed associates are controlled and monitored based on fair value and are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit/loss, according to IFRS 9 and IAS 28 p.18-19.\n\n## Reporting of associates in accordance with the equity method\n\nAssociates are reported in the consolidated financial statements as of the date when significant influence was obtained. When applying the equity method, the carrying amount of the investments in associates that is reported in the consolidated financial statements, corresponds to the Group's share of the associates' equity, consolidated goodwill, and any consolidated surpluses/deficits.\n\nIn the consolidated Income Statement, the Group's share of the associates' profit/loss that is attributable to the owners of the Parent Company (adjusted for any depreciation, impairment losses or reversals of acquired surpluses/deficits) is recognized as 'share of results in associates'. These shares of profit/loss (less any dividends received from associates) are the primary component of the change in reported value of participations in associates. The Group's share of other comprehensive income in associates is reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income.\n\nUpon acquisition of an associate, any difference between the cost of the holding including transaction costs and the investor's share of the net fair value of the associate's identifiable assets and liabilities is reported as goodwill corresponding to principles for acquisition of subsidiaries.\n\nIf the Group's share of reported losses in the associate exceeds the carrying amount of the participations in the Group, the value of the participations is reduced to zero. Losses are also offset against long-term financial receivables without collateral, the economic substance of which is comprised of part of the investor's net investment in the associate. Continuing losses are not recognized, unless the Group has an obligation to cover the losses incurred by the associate. The equity method is applied until such time when the Group no longer has significant influence.\n\nSpecification of carrying amount using the equity method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                   | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| At the beginning of the year                      | 4,189        | 4,191        |\n| Share of results in associates                    | 1,825        | 579          |\n| Share of other comprehensive income in associates | -240         | -72          |\n| Dividends to owners                               | -2,130       | -486         |\n| Other changes in associated companies equity      | 4            | -25          |\n| Exchange rate differences                         | -5           | 2            |\n| BS  Carrying amount at year-end                   | 3,643        | 4,189        |",

The cost of inventories is calculated using the FIFO (first in, first out) method or by using the weighted average cost formula. This is because the products in the Group's inventories have different natures or uses.\n\nNet realizable value is based on the estimated sales price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to bring about a sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                               | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Raw materials and consumables | 1,951        | 1,949        |\n| Work in progress              | 227          | 152          |\n| Finished goods                | 3,141        | 2,758        |\n| Supplies                      | 54           | 56           |\n| BS  Total                     | 5,374        | 4,915        |\n\n## Note 24 Prepaid expenses and accrued income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                           |   12/31 2020 |   12/31 2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Accrued interest income                   |          226 |          270 |\n| Other financial receivables               |           30 |            6 |\n| Accrued customer income (contract assets) |            0 |            1 |\n| Other accrued income                      |          170 |          301 |\n| Other prepaid expenses                    |          271 |          210 |\n| BS  Total                                 |          697 |          788 |\n\n## Note 25 Equity\n\n## Share capital\n\nShare capital in the Parent Company.\n\n## Other contributed equity\n\nRefers to equity contributed by shareholders. It also includes premiums paid in connection with new stock issues.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nThe translation reserve includes all foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of financial statements from foreign operations reported in a currency different from the reporting currency of the Group. The translation reserve also comprises exchange rate differences arising in conjunction with the translation of swap contracts reported as hedging instruments of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in translation reserve has had no impact on reported tax.\n\n## Revaluation reserve\n\nThe revaluation reserve includes changes in value relating to owner-occupied property and related taxes.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThe hedging reserve includes the effective component of the accumulated net change of fair value and related taxes, of an instrument used for a cash flow hedge, relating to hedging transactions not yet accounted for in the Profit/loss.\n\n## Hedging cost reserve\n\nBasis spread is the cost for swapping between different currencies. The basis spread is taken into account when the market value of Investor's swap portfolio is calculated. The basis spread is defined as hedging cost and the relating change in market value is accounted for in the hedging cost reserve.\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interest are presented in the equity separately from the equity attributable to the shareholders of the Parent Company. In the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the part attributable to the non-controlling interest are included and separately disclosed in conjunction with the statements.\n\nFor more information regarding non-controlling interests, see note P7, Participation in Group companies.",

On December 31, 2020 the Group held 1,363,280 of its own shares (1,847,630). Repurchases of own shares are reported as a deduction from equity. Cash proceeds from the sale of such equity instruments are reported as an increase in unrestricted equity. Any transaction costs are recognized directly under equity.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes that the unappropriated earnings in Investor AB:\n\n| Total available funds for distribution:       |           |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Retained earnings                             | 304,154   |\n| Net profit for the year                       | 22,855    |\n| Total                                         | 327,010   |\n| To be allocated as follows:                   |           |\n| Dividend to shareholders, SEK 14.00 per share | 10,740 1) |\n| Funds to be carried forward                   | 316,269   |\n\nTotal\n\n327,010\n\n1) Calculated on the total number of registered shares.\n\nFor more information, see the Administration Report page 53. The dividend is\n\nsubject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2021.\n\nThe dividend for 2019 amounted to SEK 6,889m (SEK 9.00 per share) and the dividend for 2018 amounted to 9,948m (SEK 13.00 per share).\n\nDividends paid out per share for 2019 and 2018 correspond to proposed dividend per share (in 2019 the proposal was revised before the Annual General Meeting). Dividends are recognized as a liability as soon as the Annual  General Meeting has approved the dividend for the year.\n\n## Capital management\n\nIn order to be able to act upon business opportunities at any point in time, it is vital for Investor to maintain financial flexibility. The Group's goal is to have leverage (net debt as a percentage of total assets) of 5-10 percent over an economic cycle. The ceiling for Investor's leverage has been set at a maximum of 25 percent, which may only be exceeded on a short-term basis. Investor's leverage at the beginning of the year was 2.8 percent and at the end of the year 4.1 percent. The change is mainly due to cash flows arising from dividends from Listed Companies, proceeds from sales within the operating segments Investments in EQT and Patricia  Industries, investments in Advanced Instruments, ABB, Ericsson and EQT funds and dividends paid to shareholders. For more information, see the Administration Report page 11.\n\nThe Group's total shareholder return objective (sum of the share price change and dividend) is to exceed the risk-free interest rate plus a risk premium, i.e. 8-9 percent. The total shareholder return for 2020 was 19.3 percent.\n\nCapital is defined as total recognized equity.\n\n| Equity                                             | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company | 461,837      | 420,681      |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interest           | 939          | 242          |\n| BS  Total                                          | 462,775      | 420,923      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Put options to non-controlling interests\n\nAgreements with non-controlling interests exists that obliges Investor to, at specified occasions, purchase equity instruments in subsidiaries if the counterparty wants to divest them. The agreement, put option, is a contract to purchase the group's own equity instruments and thus gives rise to a financial liability. The liability is included in Other long-term liabilities, see note 29, Other long-term and short-term liabilities. The obligation under the put option is valued at the estimated redemption amount at the time when the equity instrument can be put to Investor. The put option is valued at the proportionate value in relation to the fair value of the subsidiary. At remeasurement of the liability, the change of value is recognized in net financial items.\n\nAt initial recognition of the put option as a liability, equity is reduced by an amount corresponding to its fair value. Firstly equity attributable to the noncontrolling interests are reduced and if this is insufficient in retained earnings attributable to shareholders of the Parent Company.",

In such cases, the size of the employee's pension depends on the contributions the company makes to the plan, or to an insurance company, along with the return that the capital contributions generate. Consequently, the employee carries both the actuarial risk (i.e. the risk that benefits will be lower than expected) and the investment risk (i.e. the risk that invested assets will be insufficient for providing the expected benefits). The company's obligations to pay contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the Income Statement at the rate that employees provide services to the company during a period.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nIn defined benefit pension plans, payments are made to employees and former employees based on their salary at the time of retirement and the number of years of service. The Group carries the risk for making the payments. The net obligation under defined benefit plans is measured separately for each plan, by estimating the future benefits earned, including taxes, by the employees, in current and prior periods.\n\nThis benefit is discounted to a present value with a discount rate representing the closing day rate on high quality corporate bonds, mortgage backed bonds or government bonds with a life corresponding to the duration of the pension obligations. The measurement is made by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The fair value of any plan assets is calculated on the closing date.\n\nWhen determining the present value of the obligation and the fair value of plan assets, actuarial gains and losses may arise. This is either because the actual outcome differs from the previous assumption or because the assumptions have changed. Remeasurements of defined benefit obligations are recognized as income or expenses in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe value presented in the Balance Sheet for pensions and similar commitments corresponds to the obligation's present value at year-end, less the fair value of plan assets. When the calculation results in a Group asset, the carrying amount of the asset is limited to the present value of future re payments from the plan or decreased future payments to the plan (asset ceiling).\n\nThe net of the interest on pension liabilities and the yield on adherent management assets is recognized in net financial items. Other components are recognized in operating profit/loss.\n\n## Risks associated with the defined benefit plan\n\n## Investment risks\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated using discount rates with references to, for example, corporate bond yields. If assets in funded plans under perform this yield, it will increase the amount of deficit. Allocation of assets among different categories is important to reduce the portfolio risk. The time horizon for the investments is also an important factor.\n\n## Interest risks\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value of the defined benefit obligation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Longevity risk\n\nThe majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the plan member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## Salary risk\n\nThe majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for plan members based on annual salaries. If salaries increase faster than has been assumed, this will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## Pension benefits\n\nEmployees in Group companies have various kinds of pension benefits. These benefits are either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. In Sweden the total retirement benefit package is often a mixed solution with some parts being defined contribution pension plans and others being defined benefit pension plans. Salaried employees' plans comprise of the defined benefit plan ITP and the additional defined contribution plan ITPK.\n\nThe ITP plan is secured with the insurance company Alecta. Since the information provided by Alecta is not sufficient to be able to account for as a defined benefit plan, the Alecta plan has been reported as a defined contribution plan (multi-employer plan).\n\nThe ITP plan has contracts with a premium, where benefits continue unchanged until retirement. This means that premiums can not be changed to the policyholder's or the insured's disadvantage.\n\nThe Group operates defined contribution plans in Sweden, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Malaysia and the UK. The plans imply that the Group obtains pension insurances or makes payments to foundations.\n\n74 percent of the Group's defined benefit plans exist in Sweden. Other defined benefit plans exist in the U.S., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Thailand, Italy, France and Austria. The plans in Belgium, the U.S. and the Netherlands are funded. In Sweden there are funded and unfunded plans and the plans in other countries are unfunded.\n\n## Amounts recognized in Profit/loss\n\n## and Other Comprehensive income for defined benefit plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Components of defined benefit cost (gain -)                                                | 2020                  | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Current service cost                                                                       | 58                    | 85     |\n| Past service cost and gains/losses from settlements                                        | -17                   | -20    |\n| Additional pension obligations                                                             | 3                     | 3      |\n| Other values                                                                               | -2                    | -3     |\n| Total operating cost                                                                       | 42                    | 66     |\n| Net interest expense                                                                       | 16                    | 22     |\n| Exchange rate differences                                                                  | -                     | -      |\n| Total financial cost                                                                       | 16                    | 22     |\n| Components recognized in profit/loss                                                       | 59                    | 88     |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability (gain -)                                | 2020                  | 2019   |\n| Return on plan assets (excl. amounts in interest income)                                   | -15                   | -45    |\n| Actuarial gains/losses, demographic assumptions                                            | -1                    | 0      |\n| Actuarial gains/losses, financial assumptions                                              | 60                    | 235    |\n| Actuarial gains/losses, experience adjustments                                             | 32                    | -8     |\n| Other                                                                                      | 0                     | -2     |\n| Components in Other Comprehensive income                                                   | 76                    | 180    |\n| Provision for defined benefit plans                                                        |                       |        |\n| The amount included in the consolidated Balance Sheet   arising from defined benefit plans | 12/31 2020 12/31 2019 |        |\n| Present value of funded or partly funded obligations                                       | 430                   | 469    |\n| Present value of unfunded obligations                                                      | 1,027                 | 920    |\n| Total present value of defined benefit obligations                                         | 1,457                 | 1,389  |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                                                  | -271                  | -275   |\n| NPV of obligations and fair value of plan assets                                           | 1,186                 | 1,114  |\n| Restriction on asset ceiling recognized                                                    |                       |        |\n| BS   Net liability arising from                                                            | 0                     | -      |\n| defined benefit obligations                                                                | 1,186                 | 1,114  |",

This may involve interpolation of bond yield curves where there is no direct match for duration or the market is not deep for matching bond durations. The market for high quality Swedish mortgage backed bonds is considered to be deep and thereby fulfills the requirements of high quality corporate bonds according to IAS 19. Swedish mortgage backed bonds have therefore served as reference when determining the discount rate used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligations in Sweden. In countries where there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds, government bonds are used as a reference when determining the discount rate.\n\n## Maturity profile of the majority of the defined benefit obligation\n\n| Maturity profile   |   0-3 year |   4-6 year |   7-15 year | Over 15 year   | Total   |\n|--------------------|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|---------|\n| Cash flows         |         75 |         89 |         361 | 1,236          | 1,761   |\n\n## Multi-employer plans\n\nThe Swedish ITP plan is secured with the insurance company Alecta, which is a mutual life insurance company, owned by its customers, i.e. businesses and their employees. The company form means that any surplus in operations is returned to the customers and the insured population is responsible for any deficit. For the fiscal year 2020 the Investor Group did not have access to information that would make it possible to recognize it as a defined benefit plan. The ITP pension plan secured through insurance from Alecta is therefore recognized as a defined contribution plan. The premium for the defined benefit pension plan is calculated individually and depends on salary, pension already earned and expected remaining period of service. For 2021, the  Investor Group expect to pay SEK 21m for premiums to Alecta (17). Alecta's total premiums per year for defined benefit pensions is about SEK 15bn (15).\n\nA measure of the financial strength of a mutual insurance company is the collective funding ratio, which shows the relationship between the assets and the total insurance undertaking. The collective funding ratio measures distributable assets in relation to insurance commitments. The insurance commitment is comprised of guaranteed commitments and allocated rebates to the insured and policy holders, calculated according to Alecta's technical methods and assumptions, which differ from the methods and assumptions applied in the valuation of defined benefit pensions according to IAS 19.\n\nAccording to Alecta's consolidation policy for defined benefit insurance, the collective funding ratio is usually allowed to vary between 125 and 175 percent. With a low funding ratio, one measure to increase the ratio can be to increase the price of newly subscribed benefits and benefit increases. If the collective funding ratio exceeds 150 percent, the policyholder's premiums can be reduced. By the end of 2020 the surplus of the collective funding ratio in Alecta was 148 percent (148).\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\n| Defined contribution plans              |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expenses for defined contribution plans |    397 |    481 |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nValuation of provision for pensions and similar obligations are estimates of present and future values. There are always uncertainty involved. Alternative assumptions will give different present values.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below shows the values after discount rate changes, from the current rate used.\n\n| Discount rate                                | 1 percentage  point increase   | 1 percentage  point decrease   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Present value of defined benefit obligations | 1,167                          | 1,782                          |\n| Current service cost                         | 42                             | 72                             |\n| Interest expense                             | 21                             | 3                              |",

        "page_content": "## Note 31 Financial instruments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFinancial instruments recognized in the consolidated Balance Sheet include assets such as the following: shares and participations recognized at fair value, other financial investments, loan receivables, trade receivables, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents, and derivatives. Liabilities recognized in the Balance Sheet include the following: loans, shares on loan, trade payables and derivatives.\n\nA financial asset or financial liability is recognized in the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Trade receivables and trade payables are recognized in the Balance Sheet when an invoice is sent or received.\n\nA financial asset or part thereof is derecognized in the Balance Sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire. A financial liability or part thereof is  derecognized in the Balance Sheet when it is extinguished - i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or canceled or expires.\n\nA financial asset and liability are offset against one another and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right and an intention to set off the recognized amounts.\n\nA purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized on the trade date, which is the date that an entity commits itself to purchase or sell an asset.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nFinancial instruments are allocated to different categories. For financial assets classification is based on the entity's business model for managing the financial asset and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset.\n\nThere are three different business models according to IFRS 9 which are based on how the cash flows from the asset are realized:\n\n- \u00b7 By collecting the contractual cash flows over the life of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 By both collecting the contractual cash flows from the financial assets and by selling financial assets.\n- \u00b7 By selling the financial assets.\n\nIf the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to realize the cash flows from the financial asset by collecting the contractual cash flows over the life of the asset and those cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, the asset shall be measured at amortized cost.\n\nIf the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to realize the cash flows from the financial asset both by collecting the contractual cash flows and by selling financial assets and those cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, the asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\nIn all other cases the financial asset shall be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n- Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost, except for:\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value; and\n- \u00b7 contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit/loss Financial assets within a business model that are measured at fair value through profit/loss are divided into: 'financial assets excluding derivatives used in hedge accounting' and 'derivatives used in hedge accounting'.\n\nFinancial assets excluding derivatives used in hedge accounting includes all share holdings within the Group. All financial investments and cash and cash equivalents within the liquidity portfolio are included here as well.\n\nDerivatives used in hedge accounting, consists of derivatives used in hedge accounting with a positive fair value. More information can be found under Derivatives on page 98.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nInvestor currently has no financial assets within a business model in this category.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes trade receivables, other short-term receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the subsidiaries within Patricia Industries. These assets are short-term in nature, which is why they are reported at nominal amounts without any discounting.\n\nThis category also includes other financial investments and long-term receivables managed within a business model that can be described as 'hold-to-collect', meaning that the cash flows from the assets are realized by collecting the contractual cash flows over the life of the financial assets.\n\nThe contractual cash flows from all the receivables within the category 'financial assets measured at amortized cost' are considered to be solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nA loss allowance is recognized for all financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost. For all these financial assets, except trade receivables, the loss allowance is calculated as 12 month expected losses or, if the credit risk for the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, as lifetime expected losses. The assessment is made every balance sheet day and if any contractual payments for a loan are more than 30 days past due, the credit risk is considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nFor trade receivables a simplified approach is applied and a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses are recorded. The deduction for defaulted debts are assessed on an individual basis, with an additional allowance for trade receivables that are not past due. This loss rate allowance reflects a three years history of credit losses and are calculated and reviewed regularly in order to reflect current conditions and forecasts about the future.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit/loss Financial liabilities within a business model that are measured at fair value through profit/loss are divided into: 'financial liabilities excluding derivatives used in hedge accounting' and 'derivatives used in hedge accounting'.\n\nFinancial liabilities excluding derivatives used in hedge accounting mainly relates to written put options that may result in Group companies receiving their own equity shares and being obligated to deliver cash corresponding to the fair value of the equity shares. Shares on loan in the trading operation are also classified as financial liabilities, except derivatives used in hedge accounting. When shares on loan are sold, an amount corresponding to the fair value of the shares is recorded as a liability. This category also includes contingent considerations recognized in business combinations to which IFRS 3 applies.\n\nDerivatives used in hedge accounting include any derivatives used in hedge accounting with a negative fair value (except for derivatives that is part of a cash flow hedge). More information can be found under Derivatives on page 98.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nThis category includes all other financial liabilities than those measured at fair value through profit/loss above. Amortized cost is calculated based on the effective interest that was determined when the loan was obtained. This means that surpluses/deficits, as well as direct issuing costs, are amortized over the life of the liability. Trade payables are short-term in nature, which is why they are recognized at nominal amounts without any discounting.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nDisclosures regarding financial instruments can also be found in: note 3, Financial risks and risk management; note 13, Net financial items; note 21, Other financial investments, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents; and note 26, Interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n31\n\n31",

value\n\nFollowing is a description of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities shown in this Annual Report. Changed conditions regarding the determination of fair value of financial instruments cause transfer between levels described below.\n\n## Measurements of financial instruments in level 1\n\n## Listed holdings\n\nListed holdings are valued on the basis of their share price (bid price, if there is one quoted) on the balance sheet date.\n\n## Measurements of financial instruments in level 2\n\n## Shares and participations\n\nShares and participations in level 2 consist of holdings in listed shares for which the classes are not actively traded. The measurement of these shares is based on the market price for the most traded class of shares for the same holding.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives in level 2 consist mainly of currency and interest rate swaps for which the valuation is based on discounted future cash flows according to the terms and conditions in the agreement and based on relevant market data.\n\n## Measurement of financial instruments in level 3\n\nUnlisted holdings and fund holdings\n\nUnlisted holdings are measured on the basis of the 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines'.\n\nFor directly owned holdings (i.e. those owned directly by a company in the Investor Group), an overall evaluation is made to determine the measurement method that is appropriate for each specific holding. It is first taken into account whether a recent financing round or 'arm's length transaction' has been made. As a secondary measure, a valuation is made by applying relevant multiples to the holding's key ratios, derived from a relevant sample of comparable companies, with deduction for individually determined adjustments as a consequence of the size difference between the company being valued and the sample of comparable companies. In those cases when other measurement methods better reflect the fair value of a holding, this value is used.\n\nUnlisted holdings in funds are measured at Investor's share of the value that the fund manager reports for all unlisted fund holdings (Net Asset Value) and is normally updated when a new valuation is received. If Investor's assessment is that the fund manager's valuation does not sufficiently take into account factors that affect the value of the underlying holdings, or if the valuation is considered to deviate considerably from IFRS principles, the value is adjusted.\n\nWhen estimating the fair value market conditions, liquidity, financial condition, purchase multiples paid in other comparable third-party transactions, the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company, and operating results and other financial data of the portfolio company are taken in consideration as applicable. Representatives from Investor's management participate actively in the valuation process within Investor Growth  Capital (IGC) and evaluate the estimated fair values for holdings in IGC and the EQT funds in relation to their knowledge of the development of the portfolio companies and the market. Listed holdings in funds are measured in the same way as listed holdings, as described above.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe valuation of currency interest rate swaps with long duration and limited liquidity is based on discounted cash flows according to the terms and conditions of the agreement and based on an estimated market rate for similar instruments with diverse durations.\n\n## Options\n\nThe value of unlisted options is calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation model.\n\n## Fair value of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet\n\n## Interest-bearing liabilities\n\nThe fair value would be classified in level 3 and is based on market prices and generally accepted methods, in which future cash flows have been discounted at the current interest rate, including Investor's current credit rating, for the remaining life.\n\n## Loans, trade receivables and trade payables\n\nThe carrying amounts of loans, trade receivables and trade payables are considered to reflect their fair value.\n\n31\n\n31\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nP5\n\nP6\n\nP7\n\nP8\n\nP9\n\nP10\n\nP11\n\nP12\n\nP13\n\nP14\n\nP15\n\nP16\n\nP17\n\nP18",

Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and the actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made.\n\nThe unlisted part of Financial Investments portfolio companies, corresponds to 92 percent of the portfolio value (93). Part of the unlisted portfolio is valued based on comparable companies, and the value is dependent on the level of the\n\nmultiples. The multiple ranges provided in the note show the minimum and maximum value of the actual multiples applied in these valuations. A 10 percent change of the multiples would have an effect on the Financial Investments portfolio value of approximately SEK 100m (100).\n\nFor the derivatives, a parallel shift of the interest rate curve upwards by one percentage point would affect the profit/loss and equity positively by approximately SEK 1,000m (1,000).",

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value through profit/loss, which means that transaction costs are charged to profit/loss for the period. In the following periods, the derivative instrument is recognized at fair value and changes in the value are recognized in the Income Statement as income or expense (part of operating profit) or as part of net financial items. Where they are reported is based on the purpose of the derivative and whether its use is related to an operating item or a financial item. The interest rate coupon from an interest rate swap is recognized as interest and value changes are recognized as other financial items as a component of financial net, provided that the interest rate swap is not part of a cash flow hedge, which is accounted for according to the description below. Disclosures related to derivatives can also be found in note 3, Financial risks and risk management.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nInvestor applies hedge accounting in order to reduce fluctuations in profit/ loss related to hedging of interest rate risks and currency risks. When hedge accounting is applied, value changes related to the hedging instrument is presented in profit/loss at the same time as the result from the hedged item. The effective part of the hedge is presented in the same component of the income statement as the hedged item.\n\n## Receivables and liabilities in foreign currency\n\nCurrency derivatives are used to hedge receivables and liabilities against foreign exchange rate risks. Hedge accounting is not used to protect against foreign exchange risk since an economic hedge has already been reflected in the financial statements. This occurs by recognizing the underlying receivable or liability at the closing rate and the hedge instrument at fair value in the Income Statement.\n\nHedging of interest rate and exchange rate risks - fair value hedges In some cases, the Group uses derivatives as hedging instruments for different types of financial risks connected with the Group's external borrowing.\n\nFor example, a fixed rate loan in foreign currency can be swapped to floating rate SEK with foreign currency interest rate swaps. The loan's credit spread component on initial recognition is not included in the hedging relationship. The so-called FX basis spread is defined as a hedging cost and is not part of the hedge either. The market value of the hedging instrument relating to basis spread is instead accounted for in equity.\n\nAs long as hedge accounting is applied, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged, and those fair value changes are recognized in profit/loss. The hedging instrument is measured at fair value, with changes in fair value also recognized in profit/loss.\n\nHedging of the Group's interest rate exposure - cash flow hedges In some cases Investor uses interest rate swaps to control the exposure to variability in cash flows of future interest rate fluctuations for loans with a variable interest rate. In the Balance Sheet, interest rate swaps are valued at fair value. The interest rate coupon is recognized on an on-going basis in the Income Statement as a component of interest expense. Unrealized changes to the fair value of interest rate swaps are recognized in Other Comprehensive income and are included as a component of the hedging reserve until the hedged item has an effect on the Income Statement and as long as the criteria for hedge accounting and effectiveness are met.\n\n## Hedging of the Group's currency exposure - cash flow hedges\n\nNormally cash flows in foreign currencies are not hedged. However specific unusual currency cash flows in some cases can be hedged. In the Balance Sheet, these contracts are valued at fair value. Unrealized changes to the fair value of currency contracts are recognized in Other Comprehensive income and are included as a component of the hedging reserve until the hedged item has an effect on the Income Statement and as long as the criteria for hedge accounting and effectiveness are met.\n\n## Hedging of currency risk in foreign net investments\n\nIn the consolidated Balance Sheet, investments in foreign operations are reported as net assets in subsidiaries. The Group do not apply hedge accounting for the currency risk in foreign net investments.\n\n## Hedging instruments together with hedged items and derivatives without hedge accounting\n\n|

A provision is recognized if and only if a present obligation (legal or constructive) has arisen as a result of a past event (the obligating event), the payment is probable (more likely than not), and the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\n| Pledged assets                               | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| In the form of pledged securities            |              |              |\n| for liabilities and provisions               |              |              |\n| Real estate mortgages                        | 3,173        | 3,147        |\n| Shares etc. 1)                               | 17,759       | 11,251       |\n| Other pledged and equivalent collateral      |              |              |\n| Bank Guarantee                               | 3            | 3            |\n| Total pledged assets                         | 20,935       | 14,400       |\n| 1) Pledged shares for loans in subsidiaries. |              |              |\n| Contingent liabilities                       | 12/31 2020   | 12/31 2019   |\n| Guarantee commitments to FPG/PRI             | 1            | 1            |\n| Guarantees on behalf of associates           | -            | -            |\n| Other contingent liabilities                 | 1,077        | 2,310        |\n| Total contingent liabilities                 | 1,078        | 2,311        |\n\nOther contingent liabilities consist of warranties within the wholly-owned subsidiaries. The decrease in contingent liabilities is mainly related to the change in appeals regarding deducted interest expenses.\n\nInvestor AB's subsidiaries have historically claimed deductions for interest expenses, some have been denied by the tax authorities. Investor has always believed that these deductions have been claimed rightfully and appealed the cases during 2019. In 2020, the deductions were tried in court and the outcome was in favor of Investor and the deductions consequently allowed. The interest deductions that were challenged by the tax authorities were treated as contingent liabilities with SEK 377m in 2019. These are no longer treated as contingent liabilities.\n\nThe credit facilities within the wholly-owned subsidiaries are subject to financial covenants.\n\n## Note 33 Related party transactions\n\nThe following additional information about related parties is being provided in addition to what has been reported in other notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Relations with related parties\n\nThe Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation has significant influence over Investor (in accordance with the definition in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures) and therefore a related party relationship (see Other related party in the table below). Investor has also a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and associated companies.\n\n## Companies with common board members\n\nIn addition to the above-noted relations with related parties, there are a number of companies in which Investor and the company have common board members. Since these situations do not imply influence of the type described in IAS 24, information has not been provided in this note.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions with related parties are priced according to market terms, for information about the Parent Company see note P18, Related party transactions.\n\n## With key management personnel\n\nSee note 11, Employees and personnel costs for information about salaries and other compensation, costs and commitments regarding pensions and similar benefits, and severance payment agreements for the board, President and other senior executives.\n\n## Investment programs\n\nSelected senior staff and other senior executives within Patricia Industries have had the opportunity for a number of years to make parallel investments to some extent with Investor. The Carried interest plans created within the former Investor Growth Capital (IGC), are designed in accordance with market practice in the venture capital market and provide an economic incentive for managers and encourage personal commitment to analysis and investment work since the result is directly connected to the financial performance of the business. Carried interest plans are linked to realized growth in the value of holdings, after deduction for costs, seen as a portfolio.\n\nDuring the year, a total of SEK 7m was paid out to senior staff within Investor from these programs (4). The provision (not paid out) on unrealized gains to senior staff amounted to SEK 5m at year-end (2). Expensed amounts were reported in the item 'Changes in Value' in the Income Statement.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\n|                               | Associates   | Associates   | Other related party   | Other related party   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                               | 2020         | 2019         | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Sales of products/services    | 10           | 9            | 10                    | 10                    |\n| Purchase of products/services | 6            | 54           |                       |                       |\n| Financial expenses            | 148          | 145          |                       |                       |\n| Financial income              | 6            | 71           |                       |                       |\n| Dividend received             | 3,241        | 6,265        |                       |                       |\n| Dividend paid                 | -            | -            | 1,381                 | 1,995                 |\n| Receivables                   | 5,043        | 4,044        | 0                     | 0                     |\n| Liabilities                   | 8,523        | 5,274        | 3                     | 3                     |\n\n34\n\n35",

Investor has used the new standard prospectively and therefore used the transition method to apply the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The lease liability initially recognized corresponds to the present value of the remaining lease payments, except short-term leases and leases of low value, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as per January 1, 2019. The average incremental borrowing rate was 3.8 percent at the date of initial application of IFRS 16.\n\nThe right-of-use asset connected to the lease payments yet not paid, has initially in most cases been measured to an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted for the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to these lease contracts. In some cases, the right-of-use asset has been measured at its carrying amount as if the Standard had been applied since the commencement date instead, but discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019. This method has had an effect on retained earnings of SEK -25m. The total right-of-use assets as per January 1, 2019, were SEK 3,023m. Of these, SEK 2,809m was buildings and land and mainly related to rental agreements for offices and industrial premises. The effect on the Consolidated Income Statement was SEK -40m during 2019. This due to leasing costs being reversed and instead being accounted for as depreciation and interest expense, applying an effective interest method. In the Consolidated Cash Flow the cash payments within Operating activities have decreased correspondingly and are instead reported as interest paid within Operating activities and repayment of borrowings within Financing activities.\n\nEffect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to changes in accounting policies\n\n|                                         | Reported   as per   12/31 2018   | Adjustment  due to   IFRS 16   | Adjusted   as per   1/1 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Buildings and land                      | 7,098                            | 2,809                          | 9,907                          |\n| Whereof finance leases                  | 111 1)                           | 2,809                          | 2,920                          |\n| Machinery and equipment                 | 3,362                            | 214                            | 3,576                          |\n| Whereof finance leases                  | 17 1)                            | 214                            | 231                            |\n| Shares and participations in associates | 4,191                            | -25 2)                         | 4,166                          |\n| Other receivables (current)             | 318                              | -41 3)                         | 277                            |\n| Total equity                            | 327,690                          | -25                            | 327,665                        |\n| Long-term interest-bearing liabilities  | 63,866                           | 2,380                          | 66,246                         |\n| Whereof lease liabilities               | 106 1)                           | 2,380                          | 2,487                          |\n| Current interest-bearing liabilities    | 3,845                            | 602                            | 4,447                          |\n| Whereof lease liabilities               | 16 1)                            | 602                            | 618                            |\n\nReconciliation of operating lease commitments (IAS 17) and reported lease liabilities (IFRS 16)\n\n| Non-cancellable future lease payments as of December 31, 2018   | 4,537   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Financial lease liability as of December 31, 2018               | 123     |\n| Short-term lease contracts                                      | -36     |\n| Low value lease contracts                                       | -33     |\n| Effects of extension options                                    | 485     |\n| Effects of reclassification of lease contracts                  | -24     |\n| Effects of adjustments of indexes or other variable fees        | -90     |\n| Effects due to discounting                                      | -764    |\n| Effects due to divested operations                              | -1,133  |\n| Exchange rate differences                                       | 40      |\n| Lease liability as of January 1, 2019                           | 3,105   |\n\n## Investment Property\n\nFrom mid-January, 2019, certain properties are classified as Investment Property according to IAS 40 due to the properties being leased out to external lessees after that time.

        "page_content": "## Note P1 Accounting policies\n\nThe Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities has been applied for the Parent Company. The Parent Company applies the same accounting policies as the Group unless otherwise noted. Any differences between the accounting policies of the Parent Company and those of the Group are caused by limitations to the application of IFRS in the Parent Company because of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Significant accounting policies for the Parent Company that differs from the Group are presented in this note. Other significant accounting policies are presented in note 1, Significant accounting policies and in connection to respective note to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are companies in which Investor AB is able to exert a controlling influence. Controlling influence is the power to, either directly or indirectly, govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain economic benefits from its activities.\n\nIn the Parent Company, participations in Group companies are recognized in accordance with the cost method and in legal entities, transaction costs attributable to business combinations will be included in the acquisition cost.\n\nContingent consideration is valued based on the likelihood that the consideration will be paid. Any changes to the provision/receivable result in an increase/ decrease in the cost of acquisition. On each balance sheet date, the carrying amounts are reviewed to determine if there are any indications of impairment. Dividends from subsidiaries are included in the Parent Company's operating profit/loss.\n\n## Shareholders' contribution\n\nShareholders' contributions are recognized directly in equity by the receiver and are capitalized in Participations in Group companies by the giver to the extent that no impairment loss is required.\n\n## Associates\n\nBased on how Investor controls and monitors the companies' operations, Participations in associates are recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. For further information see note 20, Shares and participations in associates.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nIn the Parent Company, borrowing costs are charged to profit/loss during the period they pertain to. Borrowing costs are not capitalized.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe Parent Company's financial guarantee contracts consist primarily of guarantees on behalf of subsidiaries and associates.\n\nThe Parent Company applies RFR 2 IFRS 9 item 1, to account for financial guarantee contracts issued on behalf of associates, which is somewhat more lenient than the rules in IFRS 9, due to the relationship between accounting and taxation. The Parent Company recognizes financial guarantee contracts as a provision in the Balance Sheet when the company has a commitment for which payment will most likely be required.\n\n## Tax regulation\n\nThe Parent Company is taxed in accordance with the Swedish rules for certain holding companies. The purpose of these rules is to allow reallocations of its holdings without tax consequences. To be eligible for these rules, the company should, almost exclusively, manage an equity portfolio providing the shareholders risk allocation. The regulations for industrial holding companies imply that capital gains on shares are not taxable and corresponding capital losses are non-deductible. Dividends received and interest income are both taxable items, while administrative costs, interest expenses and dividend paid are all deductible. Moreover, the Parent Company declares a standard income of 1.5 percent on the market value of listed shares when the voting rights at the beginning of the year are less than 10 percent, or when they exceed 10 percent but, at the beginning of the year, had been owned for less than one year. As a consequence of these tax regulations, the Parent Company typically does not pay income tax. For the same reason, the Parent Company does not report deferred tax attributable to temporary differences. The regulations for industrial holding companies also imply that the Parent Company may neither give nor receive Group contributions.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Parent Company applies RFR 2 IFRS 16 item 1, and therefore recognize leases in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Note P2 Operating costs\n\n## Personnel\n\nExpensed wages, salaries and other remunerations amounted to SEK 253m (246), of which social costs SEK 58m (53). The average number of employees at year-end were 71 (72). For more information see note 11, Employees and personnel costs on page 71.\n\n## Auditor's fees and expenses\n\n|                                          | 2020     | 2019     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Auditor in charge                        | Deloitte | Deloitte |\n| Auditing assignment                      | 2        | 2        |\n| Other audit activities                   | -        | 0        |\n| Total                                    | 2        | 2        |\n| Leases                                   |          |          |\n| Non-cancellable future lease payments    | 2020     | 2019     |\n| Less than 1 year from balance sheet date | 12       | 10       |\n| 1-5 years from balance sheet date        | 0        | 0        |\n| Total                                    | 12       | 10       |\n| Costs for the year                       |          |          |\n| Minimum lease payments                   | -16      | -14      |\n| Total                                    | -16      | -14      |\n\nLease contracts are mainly related to rental agreement for office building.\n\n## Note P3 Results from other receivables that are non-current assets\n\n|                                      |   2020 | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income from Group companies |    888 | 988    |\n| Changes in value                     |   -284 | 209    |\n| Other interest income                |     39 | 44     |\n| Exchange rate differences            |   -984 | 776    |\n| IS  Total                            |   -340 | 2,017  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note P4 Other net financial items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income and similar items                                    |        |        |\n| Changes in value                                                     | 268    | -      |\n| Exchange rate differences                                            | 1,938  | -      |\n| IS  Total                                                            | 2,206  | -      |\n|                                                                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Interest expenses and similar items                                  |        |        |\n| Interest expenses to Group companies                                 | -331   | -347   |\n| Changes in value                                                     | -      | -151   |\n| Changes in value attributable to long-term  share-based remuneration | -34    | -36    |\n| Net financial items, internal bank                                   | -      | 0      |\n| Interest expenses, other borrowings                                  | -1,271 | -1,346 |\n| Exchange rate differences                                            | -      | -859   |\n| Other                                                                | -27    | -30    |\n| IS  Total                                                            | -1,663 | -2,771 |",

Id 556013-8298\n\n## REPORT ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS\n\n## Opinions\n\nWe have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Investor AB (publ) for the financial year January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 except for the corporate governance statement on pages 42-52 and the statutory sustainability report on pages 6-9, 14-17, 26-34, 40-41 and 116-122. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 6-17 and 40-121 in this document.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2020 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2020 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance statement on pages 42-52 and the statutory sustainability report on pages 6-9, 14-17, 26-34, 40-41 and 116-122. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.\n\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company's audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Governance over financial reporting\n\nThe companies within Patricia Industries are independent with separate internal control systems in place for their operating activities as well as processes for financial reporting.\n\nOur audit focused on the internal governance over financial reporting for several reasons. Firstly, it is important to ensure that the information reported by each entity is prepared in accordance with IFRS. Secondly, it is important to have well established procedures to ensure timely and correct financial reporting. Thirdly, monitoring controls are important to ensure high quality reporting.\n\nInvestor's information regarding the principles applied for its consolidated financial statements are included in Note 1 Significant accounting policies and in Note 20 Shares and participation in associates further explanation on the method for accounting for associates is provided.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating Investor's processes relating to internal controls over financial reporting and testing of relevant controls,\n- \u00b7 evaluating relevant internal controls in relation to critical IT-systems used for financial reporting,\n- \u00b7 evaluating Investor's monitoring controls over financial information reported from consolidated subsidiaries and associates reported under the equity method.\n\n## Valuation of listed and unlisted investments\n\nInvestor group's carrying value of listed investments amounted to SEK 404,062 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe focused on the listed investments since the carrying value is significant, there is a risk that changes in ownership might not be properly recognized, and effects of dividend received might not be properly reflected in the carrying value.\n\nInvestor's principles for accounting for listed investments, disclosures regarding the investments and description of measurement of financial instruments are included in Note 31 Financial instruments.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the valuation process and testing of relevant controls,\n- \u00b7 validating the holdings towards external statements,\n- \u00b7 validating the fair value calculation arithmetically and comparing values to official share prices,\n- \u00b7 evaluating the adequacy of disclosures relating to valuation of listed investments to ensure compliance with IFRS.\n\nInvestor group's carrying value of unlisted investments recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 24,409 million as of December 31, 2020. Investor's valuation policy is based on IFRS 13 and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. Inappropriate judgements made in the assessment of fair value could have a significant impact on the value of the unlisted investment.\n\nWe focused on the unlisted investments since the carrying value is material, the investment portfolio comprises a large number of unlisted securities and since the assessments made to arrive at the fair value is sensitive to judgements and estimates made.",

        "page_content": "Investor's principles for accounting for unlisted investments, disclosures regarding these investments and description of measurement of financial instruments are included in Note 31 Financial instruments.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the valuation process and testing of relevant controls,\n- \u00b7 validating correct ownership percentages in and proper accounting for changes in such ownership,\n- \u00b7 validating that the methodology applied in the valuation of the portfolio companies is in accordance with IFRS 13 and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines,\n- \u00b7 evaluating the relevance of multiples used in Patricia Industries' portfolio companies' estimated enterprise value calculations against market multiples from relevant transactions or market data.\n\n## Valuation of goodwill\n\nInvestor's acquisitions of M\u00f6lnlycke, Permobil,  BraunAbility, Laborie, Sarnova, Piab and Advanced Instruments have led to a portion of the purchase price being allocated to intangible assets including goodwill. Changes in economic conditions or lower than expected development of performance may be indicators of potential impairment of the recoverable amount of these assets and hence the consolidated net asset value of Investor. The total carrying amount of goodwill relating to these holdings amounted to SEK 46,488 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe focused on the assessments of the carrying value for the holdings above since value of goodwill is material and as the assessment of the recoverable amount may be sensitive to changes in assumptions.\n\nInvestor's disclosures regarding intangible assets are included in Note 16 Intangible assets, which specifically explains key assumptions used in the assessment of the recoverable amounts.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating of management's annual process for impairment test of the carrying goodwill value,\n- \u00b7 validating the valuations and financial development of each entity and discussing historical performance with management,\n- \u00b7 by involving our valuation specialists, evaluating assumptions made in management's impairment tests such as weighted average cost of capital, perpetual growth rate, prospected revenue and profit growth, as well as comparing to historic performance and other benchmark data,\n- \u00b7 evaluating the sensitivity of key assumptions,\n- \u00b7 evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures related to valuation of goodwill and to ensure compliance IFRS.\n\n## Other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts\n\nThe other information consists of the remuneration report as well as the pages 1-5, 18-39 and 122-125 in this document that also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information. We expect to obtain the remuneration report after the date of this audit report.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent\n\nwith the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts is located at the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/ revisornsansvar. This description forms part of the auditor's report.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions\n\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Investor AB (publ) for the financial year January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss.\n\nWe recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.",

At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the company's organization and the administration of the company's affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect:\n\n- \u00b7 has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or\n- \u00b7 in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the management's administration is located at the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar.

This means that our examination of the corporate governance statement is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. We believe that the examination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinions.\n\nA corporate governance statement has been prepared. Disclosures in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the second paragraph points 2-6 of the Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 the second paragraph the same law are consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and are in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\n## The auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the statutory sustainability report on pages 6-9, 14-17, 26-34, 40-41 and 116-122, and that it is prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\nOur examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR:s auditing standard RevR 12 The auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report.

The wholly-owned subsidiaries have sustainability sections on pages 26-34. The listed companies and a number of the companies within Patricia Industries also publish their own sustainability reports.

A mapping of Investor's existing sustainability reporting with references to SASB metrics is also available on our webpage. Investor reports its Communication of Progress to the UN Global Compact and climate data to CDP.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nInvestor continuously monitors its most significant economic, environmental and social impacts to ensure that Investor addresses the most important issues to its stakeholders. Key stakeholder groups have been identified based on their interest and potential impact from and on Investor's operations.\n\nInvestor's most significant sustainability topics have been identified and prioritized via ongoing engagements, dialogs, group meetings, and interviews with stakeholders through different channels and methods. Most of them are integrated in our regular work through for example ongoing dialog with  investors, analysts, employees, suppliers and partners.\n\n| Stakeholders                       | Methods of engagement                                                                                                                                                                               | Key topics                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees incl. existing           | \u00b7  Regular communication and   meetings \u00b7  Annual and semi-annual   performance reviews \u00b7  Employee surveys \u00b7  Interviews and workshops  \u00b7  External surveys concerning  employer brand and student | \u00b7  Business ethics and   governance \u00b7  Diversity and inclusion \u00b7  Employee develop- ment \u00b7  Work-life balance \u00b7  Climate              | Policy and strategic documents sustainability approach and within the Management Group, the Head of  Corporate Communication & Sustainability is responsible for coordinating | The Sustainability Policy sets the framework for Investor's sustainability  approach and work.

The stakeholders raised the importance of Investor encouraging the portfolio companies to create sustainable business models and work in a sustainable way. All of our stakeholders stress the importance of active governance of sustainability issues both as a company and as an owner in order to ensure Investor's long-term attractiveness as an investment. The results from different stakeholders showed great similarities when it comes to what was most valued. Topics that have been raised by our key stakeholders are governance, business ethics, anti-corruption, climate and diversity. All stakeholders considered these topics to be very important.\n\n| Material topic                | Boundary and impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business Ethics  & Governance | Impact within and outside the organization.

Investor is also a member in Sida's Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development with the aim of developing more efficient performance indicators and processes to measure development of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nInvestor aims to continuously generate sustainable, economic value and simultaneously have a positive impact on society and the environment, thus creating shared value. In 2020, our total paid dividend amounted to SEK 6.9bn, whereof approx. SEK 1.6bn, was distributed to our lead owners, the Wallenberg foundations, whose purpose is to grant funding to scientific research in Sweden. Investor strives to be a good corporate citizen and also supports organizations such as IVA, SNS, Chambers of Commerce, Business Challenge and Young Enterprise Sweden. The areas we prioritize are youth, education and entrepreneurship. In order to support the overall community during the pandemic, Investor engaged in Sommarsp\u00e5ret, a program which enabled teenagers to gain work-experience over summer despite a difficult labor market. Sommarsp\u00e5ret was a part of the Skills Shift Initiative and within this initiative, Investor also contributed to furloughed hotel staff reskilling into supporting elderly care staff. Investor also contributed to Omstartskommissionen, ten proposals for increasing Sweden's competitiveness on the back of the pandemic. Investor formed a Sustainability Network in 2017 where Heads of Sustainability in our portfolio companies normally meet three to four times per year to discuss different challenges and opportunities. In 2020, the Investor Sustainability Network met virtually three times.\n\n## Business Ethics & Governance\n\n## Governance and approach\n\nActing responsibly and ethically is crucial for Investor to maintain a high level of credibility. The risk for unethical behavior within Investor's organization or in our portfolio companies could have a significant negative effect on both Investor, the portfolio companies and other stakeholders. Unethical behavior could also affect the future development of the business.\n\nInvestor's Board of Directors has decided on a policy framework that sets the principles for how Investor should act as a responsible owner and company. These topics are addressed in our Code of Conduct and other documents such as our policies for sustainability, anti-corruption and whistleblowing. Our Code of Conduct guides all employees in their day to day work based on our values as well as policies. The Code of Conduct applies to all employees, Boards of Director and company representatives. All employees are expected to comply with our policies and confirm their adherence by signing Investor's Code of Conduct yearly.\n\nInvestor has zero tolerance for corruption and bribery. We also have internal procedures approved by the Management Group, aimed at providing guidance to evaluate what is appropriate and not appropriate in professional relations regarding, among other things, gifts and benefits. Gifts and benefits given and received shall always be characterized by openness and moderation. In doubtful situations, the immediate manager shall always be informed and consulted. Investor's Legal department is also available for guidance. We hold regular trainings and all policies and procedures are available on Investor's intranet. In 2020, Investor also organized a training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption with The Secretary General of The Swedish AntiCorruption Institute as a guest speaker.\n\nWe strive to maintain a transparent business climate and high business ethics and we value the safety and respect of everyone affected by our business. Through our external whistleblower system, both employees and other external parties can report suspected violations of law or business ethics. Investor's employees are an important source of insight for revealing possible misconduct that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe whistleblowing procedure is prepared and managed by Compliance and approved by Investor's Management Group. The purpose of the whistleblowing channel is to encourage employees and other stakeholders to blow the whistle on suspected misconduct without any risk of retaliation, as well as to ensure an appropriate investigation process. Reports are handled confidentially by representatives at Investor's Legal department. Access to messages received through the channel is restricted. Representatives from the Legal department decide if and how a whistleblowing report should be escalated. A summary of received reports is presented to the Board of Directors on an annual basis. In 2020, Investor received six reports through the whistle blowing channel, all were related to situations in our portfolio companies. All reports have been processed and managed.\n\n## Process covering governance, risk and compliance\n\nTo continuously develop and enhance ethical business conduct, risk management and compliance within the portfolio companies, Investor focuses on\n\nstrengthening the governance structures in relation to these areas. Investor has a structured process for this work that covers a range of areas within governance, ethics, risk and compliance. The areas are selected based on risk assessment and include, among other areas, ethical business conduct, trade compliance, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and whistleblowing. Investor's subsidiaries are reviewed in relation to the areas covered by the program, with focus on the governing structures.\n\nIn addition to the overall review a focus area is selected every year. In 2020 the focus area has been the companies' efforts to prevent bribery and corruption. Representatives from all subsidiaries have participated an awareness training followed by a review of the subsidiaries' processes. Dialogs have also been held with all listed companies about their efforts to prevent corruption and bribery. Preventive activities such as risk assessment, policies, internal control and third party controls in relation to bribery and corruption have been covered in the review and dialogs.\n\nBased on the reviews and dialogs it is concluded that all companies have set a zero tolerance principle against corruption and bribery and have processes for implementation established. The companies are continuously developing their processes. Risk assessment and Board reporting are examples on areas that in some companies have been identified for further enhancement. Focus areas 2018-2020 \u00b7 Corruption and bribery \u00b7 Board reporting \u00b7 Trade compliance \u00b7 Sustainability \u00b7 Supplier control\n\n- \u00b7 Data privacy\n\n## Targets and outcomes\n\nIn 2020, all employees at Investor AB participated in training covering principles in the policy framework. Investor's internal instructions are monitored continuously and updated at least annually. Material incidents are reported to the Management Group and the Board. All employees sign the Code of Conduct which also includes the anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy. The risk for bribery and corruption is evaluated continuously and also assessed on an annual basis as part of Investor's risk assessment process. There have been no reported incidents at Investor relating to bribery and corruption during 2020.\n\nInvestor has a procurement process that defines ownership and responsibilities when evaluating suppliers and products. Among other things suppliers and products should be evaluated in relation to quality, price, information security, business ethics, climate and human rights. Suppliers are followed- up with regularly, mostly through dialogs and assessments. Each subsidiary sets its own procedures for evaluation and audits of its suppliers. As an industrial holding company, our supply chain is neither extensive nor complex. The primary suppliers are office, software and hardware providers, consultancies and travel agents. Our own analysis shows limited sustainability related risks in our supply chain. Suppliers are primarily active in Nordic countries and there have been no major changes of suppliers during 2020.\n\nOur portfolio companies are expected to adhere to Investor's Sustainability Guidelines (see page 14). The guidelines define the expectations applicable to all portfolio companies to conduct their operations in a responsible and ethical manner. They require, among other things, that our portfolio companies have adequate policies, processes and resources to manage and monitor business ethics, and that they have secure whistleblowing systems in place.\n\nA key priority for Investor is to ensure full compliance of the requirements in the Sustainability Guidelines. Investor continuously monitors the portfolio companies' development and progress. Both through reviews, dialogs and the annual sustainability self-assessment questionnaire.\n\n| Portfolio companies                              | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Companies that have signed the UN Global Compact | 96%    | 95%    | 83%    |\n| Companies that have a whistleblowing channel     | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Companies that have an anti-corruption policy    | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Companies that have a Code of Conduct            | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Companies that have a human rights policy        | 100%   | 95%    | -      |\n| Companies that have a health and safety policy   | 100%   | 100%   | -      |\n\nIn 2020, the number of major portfolio companies increased by two, from 22 to 24 compared to 2019. Patricia Industries acquired Advanced Instruments and Listed Companies added Electrolux Professional, a spin-off from Electrolux. The new portfolio company Advanced Instruments was acquired in the fourth quarter 2020 and is therefore not included in the sustainability key performance indicators for 2020. All 24 portfolio companies will be included in the sustainability key performance indicators for 2021.\n\nThe business teams within Investor develop value creation plans for each portfolio company which include business ethics and sustainability. Progress within the portfolio companies regarding business ethics and the sustainability guidelines are monitored regularly and if a serious sustainability related issue occurs in one of our companies, Investor's business team is responsible for raising the matter and for monitoring the steps the company takes to address the issue.",

Investor strives for diversity across all dimensions: nationality, age, gender, education as well as differences in mindsets and experiences.\n\nInvestor aims to provide a best-in-class working environment for our employees. Investor mirrors the collective bargaining agreement for the banking community and offer our employees the same or better benefits. All employees shall be treated equally, fairly and with respect regardless of age, gender, national origin, disability, religion, sexual orientation or union membership, among others. Investor has zero-tolerance against any kind of harassment or discrimination.\n\nTo ensure equal opportunities in the work environment, Investor's management has established a Diversity and Inclusion Plan regarding equality initiatives for Investor's employees. The plan includes five steps: investigate, analyze, take action, follow up and evaluate. This applies to the areas equal work environment, work and parenthood, training and competence development, recruitment, equal wages, and work against harassment, sexual harassment and reprisals. Regarding compensation, we want to offer fair and market-based compensation. When it comes to equal pay, we conduct an annual salary evaluation to ensure that we provide equal compensation between men and women.\n\nA Diversity and Inclusion group has been formed that actively collaborates on initiatives to further strengthen diversity and inclusion within Investor. We are convinced that making use of the total available talent base builds stronger and more dynamic teams and we strive to expand our recruitment base. When recruiting, our ambition is to have a diverse slate of candidates and diverse interview panels. Investor organizes regular training for employees. In 2020, Investor arranged training for employees in the strengths and challenges of a diverse team from a research perspective and the importance of inclusiveness. Inclusive organizations maximize the power of all differences and realize the full potential of all of their employees. We measure perceived inclusion among our employees and how our employees feel about their individual ability to make an impact yearly.\n\n## Targets and outcomes\n\nInvestor has the target to maintain a gender balance of 40/60 in Investor's Group Management, meaning at least 40 percent of the underrepresented gender. In 2020, the proportion of women in Investor AB's Management Group was 60 percent and 50 percent in the overall organization. In the end of 2020, the number of employees was 94 (headcount). Investor is well diversified in terms of age, gender and expertise. The average age among employees is 42 years.\n\n| Gender, women             | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees  1)             | 50%    | 48%    | 50%    |\n| Managers                  | 39%    | 32%    | 35%    |\n| Extended Management Group | 50%    | 50%    | 50%    |\n| Management Group          | 60%    | 60%    | 60%    |\n| Board of Directors  2)    | 44%    | 44%    | 40%    |\n\n| Age group 2020            |   <30 years |   30-50 years |   >50 years |\n|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Employees  1)             |          17 |            48 |          29 |\n| Extended Management Group |           0 |             3 |           5 |\n| Board of Directors  2)    |           0 |             0 |           9 |\n\nInvestor conducts employee engagement surveys on a regular basis. The survey in 2020 came out with strong results versus the external benchmark. The engagement score was top 5 percent of a global finance benchmark. Our strongest scores are linked to values, well-being and strategy. Investor measure perceived level of inclusion among our employees as well as their ability as individuals to make an impact and contribute to the overall strategy.\n\nIn 2020, employees reported a high level of inclusion compared to external benchmark, scoring 8.9 (scale 1-10). On belonging and on feeling valued, the equivalent scores were 9.0 and 8.8 respectively. Areas to work on are career development and to further enhance an inclusive culture, Investor will also set a target for perceived level of inclusion.\n\n| Employee survey                                      |   2020 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Employee Inclusion score (scale 1-10)                |    8.9 |\n| Employee Engagement score (scale 1-10)               |    9   |\n| Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS scale -100 to 100) |   80   |\n\n|                                           | 2020   | 2020   | 2019   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employee turnover                         | Women  | Men    | Women  | Men    |\n| Number of new employee hires              | 7      | 3      | 5      | 4      |\n| Rate of new employee hires                | 7%     | 3%     | 6%     | 4%     |\n| Number of employee turnover               | 4      | 3      | 9      | 5      |\n| Rate of employee turnover  1)             | 9%     | 7%     | 20%    | 11%    |\n| Employment contract                       |        |        |        |        |\n| Number of permanent employees             | 45     | 44     | 43     | 44     |\n| Number of temporary employees  2)         | 2      | 3      | 0      | 2      |\n| Employment type                           |        |        |        |        |\n| Number of full-time employees             | 43     | 44     | 42     | 44     |\n| Number of part-time employees             | 4      | 3      | 1      | 2      |\n| Parental leave                            |        |        |        |        |\n| Average time on parental leave, weeks  3) | 16     | 9      | 48     | 10     |\n\nIn our portfolio companies, with nearly 500,000 co-workers worldwide, it is crucial that they work with diversity and inclusion to ensure long-term successful companies. To actively promote diversity in all dimensions and encourage all our companies to do so, Investor has set diversity and inclusion targets for our portfolio. The first target is to ensure that all portfolio companies measure the perceived level of inclusion among employees on a regular basis. The second target is to reach a gender balance of 40/60 in the portfolio companies' board of directors and executive management teams from an overall portfolio perspective 2030.\n\nOur portfolio companies report progress yearly. In 2020, all companies reported that they have policies covering diversity and anti-discrimination and 83 percent of our companies have a commitment or target related to diversity, mainly focused on gender. 87 percent of our companies measured the perceived level of inclusion among their employees. The average proportion of women in the companies' management groups amounts to 25 percent. The average age is 51 and there are 23 nationalities represented. The five most common nationalities are Swedish, American, Danish, German and British. Among the Swedish portfolio companies, the management groups have on average 33 percent Non-Swedish members.\n\n| Portfolio Management Groups, women         | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Listed Companies                           | 22.3%  | 21.4%  | 21.0%  |\n| Patricia Industries                        | 30.2%  | 28.2%  | 30.3%  |\n| EQT AB                                     | 14.3%  | 16.7%  | 9.1%   |\n| Average share of women                     | 25.0%  | 24.0%  | 24.5%  |\n| Portfolio Management Groups, nationalities | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n| Listed Companies                           | 23     | 21     | 21     |\n| Patricia Industries                        | 11     | 13     | 10     |\n| EQT AB                                     | 3      | 3      | 5      |\n| Total number of different nationalities    | 23     | 21     | 21     |\n\nParticipating in nomination committees, in order to compose the best possible board for each company, is one of Investor's most important tasks as an owner. Investor is represented in nine nomination committees in the Swedish listed companies. In six of these, Investor has female representation.\n\nThe average proportion of women in the companies' boards of directors amounts to 30 percent. The average age is 57 and there are 14 nationalities represented. The most common nationalities are Swedish, American, British, Canadian and Belgian. Among the Swedish portfolio companies, the boards of directors have on average 30 percent Non-Swedish members.\n\n| Portfolio Board of Directors, women         | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Listed Companies                            | 36.5%  | 34.6%  | 35.0%  |\n| Patricia Industries                         | 19.8%  | 12.9%  | 13.1%  |\n| EQT AB                                      | 37.5%  | 16.7%  | 16.7%  |\n| Average share of women                      | 30.0%  | 24.9%  | 24.7%  |\n| Portfolio Board of Directors, nationalities | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n| Listed Companies                            | 14     | 15     | 15     |\n| Patricia Industries                         | 7      | 8      | 8      |\n| EQT AB                                      | 4      | 2      | 2      |\n| Total number of different nationalities     | 14     | 15     | 15     |\n\nThe process to collect diversity data has been improved to ensure high quality data.

Our aim is to contribute to the transition to a society with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Investor is committed to the Paris Agreement and has set long term targets for Investor as a company and for Investor's portfolio of companies.\n\nThe Board of Directors decides on the Sustainability Policy, Governance, Risk and Compliance Policy and Finance Policy, all of which set the principles for how Investor should act. The policies are reviewed and approved on an annual basis. The Board of Directors is responsible for Investor's overall strategy, including the approach to integrate sustainability aspects as part of our value creation. The CEO is a member of the Board of Directors and has overall responsibility for Investor's business strategy including climaterelated issues.\n\nRisk assessment are conducted continuously in the day to day business at Investor. A comprehensive risk assessment is made annually to identify and evaluate existing and emerging risks to mitigate. This assessment encompasses all categories of risks and involves the Management Group, representatives from the whole organization, the control functions as well as input from the subsidiaries. Material risks are compiled in a company-wide risk map. When needed, action plans are defined and implemented to minimize the probability and impact of identified risks. The conclusions drawn from the risk assessments are discussed and confirmed with the Board. The CEO and Management Group continuously follow up on the implementation of action plans and report back to the Board.\n\nThe Management Group decides on the development and execution of the sustainability approach and within the Management Group the Head of Corporate Communication & Sustainability is responsible for coordinating and driving the overall sustainability work. The managerial responsibility for responsible investments lies within the investment organization. The Heads of Listed Companies and Patricia Industries are responsible for integrating sustainability into the investment and ownership strategies, including risk assessment, due diligence, continuous monitoring and follow-up. Investor's board representative together with the business teams engage with the companies at least yearly regarding sustainability.\n\nEach business area is responsible for driving the implementation of our sustainability strategy and assessing potential risks and opportunities related to climate change. Investor also has a dedicated sustainability team that together with the business teams drive specific sustainability related projects and climate-related topics. All employees within Investor have a responsibility to work in line with the overall sustainability strategy. Investor conducts sustainability training for employees regularly and at least yearly. During the year, Investor has performed a number of activities to increase its knowledge and expertise in climate issues. Investor held several presentations and trainings for employees regarding sustainability and our focus areas during the year. There were two training sessions more connected to climate change with external speakers, one was Professor Johan Rockstr\u00f6m from Potsdam Institute with a specific focus on the science of climate change and the other one was Klas Eklund, senior economist at Mannheimer Swartling, who focused on the economics of climate change.\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nInvestor AB's investment strategy is based on the conviction that sustainability strategies are fundamental for the long-term growth of our net asset value. Given Investor's long-term investment horizon it is crucial to take climate aspects into account in investment decisions. Climate risks and opportunities exist both in the short- and long-term perspective. In the shorter term, the transition to a low carbon society also means investment opportunities, e.g. companies with products and services that contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Concurrently, there is a risk that our portfolio companies do not transform quickly enough to meet the demands for lower carbon emission solutions, impacting the long-term value of Investor's portfolio. Many of our portfolio companies are sustainability leaders, such as Electrolux, ABB and Husqvarna. These companies have over many years developed products demanded by customers who require low carbon solutions.\n\nInvestment in research and development is important to secure the longterm competitiveness of our portfolio companies. Since Investor's ownership strategy is to engage in company that are leaders in their industries, we continuously focus on their performance, their technology position and research and development strategy to develop new innovative products. The future success of our companies depends on their capacity to drive change and to invest for the long-term in new solutions that are more resource efficient and\n\nthat meet the needs of their customers. We monitor the companies' investments in research and development (R&D). In 2020, R&D expenses in our companies totaled SEK 122bn.\n\nAt Investor, climate-related issues are monitored continuously and once a year a more comprehensive analysis is conducted on all portfolio companies. As an owner we assess our portfolio's overall exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities. All 24 portfolio companies report their yearly sustainability performance to Investor. The collection of information is both through a sustainability system and through follow-up dialogues/meetings with each company. Climate calculations and analyses are performed for Investor's portfolio companies in order to identify companies' fossil fuel dependency and negative trends for carbon emissions.\n\nIt is likely that governments and international bodies such as EU will introduce various regulatory measures, which will increase the price of GHG emissions. Companies would likely also be indirectly impacted by a rise in energy costs, for example in the purchase of energy-intensive materials. Most of our holdings have a comparably low carbon impact in relation to their respective industries and due to the spread of sectors (telecommunications, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, banking) and geographical presence, it is unlikely that all of Investor's portfolio companies would be affected by increased price of GHG emissions at the same time.\n\nThe process of managing this risk involves fostering a commitment from our portfolio companies to continue to mitigate carbon emissions and adapt to a low carbon economy, e.g. by developing climate strategies, committing to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Investor develops individual value creation plans for each portfolio company and drives the climate strategy through our board representatives in the individual companies. Investor also monitors and follows our companies progress through dialogue and reporting.\n\nThe business teams and sustainability team engage with our portfolio companies on a regular basis. In 2020, Investor engaged with our 24 companies regarding sustainability. Investor follows-up with the companies each year regarding water consumption, waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThrough Investor's Sustainability Network we meet the portfolio companies' Heads of Sustainability to discuss different sustainability challenges and opportunities. Investor Sustainability Network met three times during 2020, and all three meetings focused specific on environment and climate, two related to circular economy and one regarding EU Taxonomy and Sustainable  Finance.\n\n## Targets and outcomes\n\nInvestor has committed to climate targets aligned with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees above preindustrial levels, while trying to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. The climate targets are:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduce absolute GHG emissions from Investor AB's scope 1 and 2 by 50 percent by 2030 compared with 2016.\n- \u00b7 Reduce absolute GHG emissions from portfolio companies by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2016 (the portfolio companies' scope 1 and 2).\n- \u00b7 Accelerate our portfolio companies' climate strategies beyond their basic footprint, ensuring that all portfolio companies set relevant reduction targets related to their products, services or value chain (the portfolio companies' scope 3).\n\n## Investor AB's greenhouse gas emissions\n\nInvestor AB's direct environmental impact is limited, but we take action to reduce our negative impact and carbon footprint. This includes cautious use of natural resources and energy as well as managing waste in an environmentally sound manner. Investor integrates environment and climate considerations into its business operations and risk assessments. Investor is a member and follows the UN Global Compact's ten principles, which include the precautionary principle.\n\nThe energy consumption at our head office represents more than 65 percent of Investor's total consumption. The target is to reduce consumption with three percent yearly. During the last three years Vectura, our portfolio company, from whom we rent our head office, has implemented a number of emission reduction initiatives, e.g. installed motion lighting, solar panels and charging posts for electric vehicles. At our main premises in Stockholm we use 100 percent renewable electricity.\n\nIn 2020, the total energy consumption in our offices amounted to 1,102 MWh compared to 1,291 MWh in 2019. In 2020, the scope 1 and 2 emissions for Investor AB equaled 88 tonnes, a reduction of 26 percent compared to 2016. The reduction compared to 2016 is mainly due to energy efficiency in offices and in 2020, the energy consumption in offices was also impacted by increased remote working due to covid-19 pandemic.",

Emissions are expressed in CO 2e , carbon dioxide equivalents, which means all relevant greenhouse gases are included. Definitions are presented on page 124. Investor has used the Science-based Target Setting Tool and the absolute contraction approach to identify the percentage of reduction needed to be in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Portfolio companies' greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAs an owner, we acknowledge our broader role to accelerate the transition to a sustainable low carbon economy. It is Investor's ambition to reduce the portfolio's carbon footprint by impacting companies to reduce their carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Investor aims to strengthen the portfolio's resilience and have committed to reduce absolute GHG emissions from portfolio companies by 50 percent between 2016 and 2030.\n\nThe target includes the portfolio companies' total scope 1 and 2 emissions and is set for the overall portfolio (not an equity approach). Investor has set targets on the total level in order to contribute to an actual reduction of carbon emissions. The baseline is 2016 as this is the first year we measured its companies' emissions and is aligned with the Agenda 2030. The emissions from portfolio companies' exclude Financial Investments and EQT funds.\n\n| GHG emissions, tonnes CO 2e 1)   | 2020      | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016                                    |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Listed Companies                 | 1,345,400 |         |         |         | 1,786,300 2,043,200 2,256,200 2,360,300 |\n| Patricia Industries              | 136,800   | 139,000 | 132,500 | 120,200 | 121,000                                 |\n| EQT AB  2)                       | 300       | 400     | 400     | 300     | 200                                     |\n\nPortfolio companies' emissions\n\n1,482,500\n\n1,925,700 2,176,100 2,376,700 2,481,500\n\nIn 2020, greenhouse gas emissions from our overall portfolio decreased by 40 percent compared to 2016. Investor works through its representation on the boards to drive the companies to set targets and strategies to develop resource efficient processes and to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In the yearly sustainability questionnaire Investor tracked that 78 percent of our companies had targets to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions (50).\n\nBy the end of 2020, 57 percent of our portfolio companies had aligned their climate strategies to the Paris Agreement and set measurable targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent or more by 2030 (23). By the end of 2020, the portfolio companies that represent more than 77 percent of the total emissions from the portfolio had set reduction targets that were aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe reduction of emissions is both in absolute terms and in relation to revenues, i.e. decoupling (lower carbon impact and higher revenues and economic results). The diagram shows the emissions from the total portfolio in relations to the revenue from all the portfolio companies.\n\nEmissions in relation to revenue, tonnes of CO 2e / SEK m.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Portfolio companies' indirect greenhouse gas emissions\n\nInvestor has set an additional portfolio target to ensure that all of our companies have relevant reduction targets for their scope 3 emissions. The portfolio companies' scope 3 emissions are material. It is challenging to set an overall reduction target due to the complexity of the different business models and industries, Investor has therefore set this target to ensure that our companies integrate climate in their business strategies where it is most relevant to them and ensuring that emissions upstream and downstream in the value chain are taken into consideration. 2 3\n\nIn 2020, 74 percent of our companies measured scope 3 emissions and 43 percent had reduction targets related to their products, services or value chain (the portfolio companies' scope 3 emissions). This is an increase compared to 2019 when 36 percent of the companies had reduction targets for scope 3 emissions. In terms of resource efficiency, 57 percent of our companies had targets regarding resource efficiency (50). 0 1 2020 2019 2018 2017 1,2 1,5 1,8 2,0\n\n| Portfolio companies' indirect emissions                       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Share of our companies that measured scope 3 emissions        | 74%    | 73%    |\n| Share of our companies that have reduction target for scope 3 | 43%    | 36%    |\n| Share of our companies that have resource efficiency targets  | 57%    | 50%    |\n\n## TCFD Index\n\nInvestor supports the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and have implemented its recommendations to better understand the actual and potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business, strategy and financial planning.\n\nInvestor will continue to develop our work around climate-related risks assessments and scenario analysis going forward.

This responsibility includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed. Our assignment is limited to the historical information that is presented and thus does not include future-oriented information.\n\nWe conducted limited assurance procedures in accordance with ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by IAASB. A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. A limited assurance engagement have a different focus and a considerably smaller\n\nscope compared to the focus and scope of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.\n\nThe audit firm applies ISQC 1 (International Standard on Quality Control) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are independent in relation to Investor AB (publ) according to generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden and have fulfilled our professional ethics responsibility according to these requirements.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement do not allow us to obtain such assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that could have been identified if an audit was performed. The conclusion based on a limited assurance engagement, therefore, does not provide the same level of assurance as a conclusion based on an audit has.\n\nOur procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the Group Management as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBased on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Group Management.\n\nStockholm, March 22, 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers AB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSofia G\u00f6tmar-Blomstedt\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant\n\nKarin Juslin Expert Member of FAR\n\n<!-- image -->",
