The coronavirus pandemic and resultant economic distress has challenged the entire humanity. The second wave of the pandemic has had a significant impact on lives, livelihoods, and the businesses. At its peak, it put tremendous burden on the country's health care infrastructure.\n\nAs the government has taken steps for containing the spread of the virus and providing vaccination for all, your Company has responded rapidly by putting the safety, health and wellbeing of its employees, their families, and other stakeholders as the topmost priority.\n\nQuick action was taken by your Company for upgradation of its health care infrastructure. The number of beds for COVID-19 treatment was enhanced from 192 to 1000 across hospitals in NTPC townships including over 550 beds with oxygen support.

I would like to extend my deepest condolences for the families of all those who lost their lives in this natural calamity. We would like to put on record our gratitude to the Govt. of Uttarakhand, District authorities, SDRF, ITBP, Indian Army and NDRF for all the support which they extended for rescue and search operations.\n\nThe efforts and actions of your Company in the face of extreme difficulties demonstrated its character and resilience.\n\n## Growth with energy transition:\n\nYour Company made significant achievements during this period and took several new initiatives for transforming NTPC to a more robust organization.

This is the first and the largest loan under JBIC's GREEN operations in India.\n\n## Sustainability:\n\nI would like to reaffirm that your Company is committed to make fundamental changes  in  its  business  to  transform  itself  into  the  most  sustainable  power producer as well as to become more transparent in the timely disclosure of its social, environmental, and economic performances.

Aligned to our 'The Brighter Plan 2032' goals, we have been able to reduce our specific GHG emission to 840 gm/ kWh (-3.4 % y-o-y reduction). This has been achieved due to our various energy efficiency measures and increased production from non-fossil sources including Biomass. Our current zero-carbon based energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapacity is around 7.5 % and with our further massive RE addition, we anticipate reducing our specific CO 2 emissions substantially over few years.\n\nOperating in a water intensive sector we consider it as our moral responsibility to undertake water efficiency measures at war scale and set tougher targets. Towards this end, your Company has become signatory of UN CEO Water Mandate to better its water stewardship programs as part of long-term Sustainable Development goals. Your Company is committed to champion circular economy through exploring multiple avenues of ash utilization and Waste-to-energy projects.

Your Company is geared up to adapt to these changes and is working on various models to maintain leadership in the sector.\n\nIndian power sector is evolving at a fast pace and the power demand is increasing rapidly. India recently witnessed all-time high peak demand of 200.57 GW and energy met of 4508 MUs in a day on July 07, 2021. The country also registered a generation growth of 17.17% in Q1FY 2021-22. The growth in demand augurs well for your Company. These numbers coupled with 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative indicate that there is huge potential for growth in the power sector going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reimbursement of applicable statutory taxes/levies shall be in addition to fees.\n\nAs per Rule 14 of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 read with Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013, the remuneration recommended by the Audit Committee shall be considered and approved by the Board of Directors and ratified subsequently by the shareholders.\n\nAccordingly, members are requested to ratify the remuneration payable to the Cost Auditors for the financial year 2021-22.\n\nThe Board of Directors recommended the passing of the proposed Resolution by members of the Company.\n\nThe Directors or Key Managerial Personnel or their relatives do not have any concern or interest, financial or otherwise, in passing of the said Ordinary Resolution, except to the extent of their shareholding in the Company.\n\n## Item No. 10: To raise funds up to ' 18,000 Crore through issue of Bonds/Debentures on Private Placement basis\n\nThe Company is the largest power producer in India. As the Company is under a rapid capacity expansion mode, major portion of capital expenditure requirement of the Company has to be funded by debt. The Company borrows in the form of non-convertible bonds/debentures, rupee term loans from banks and financial institutions, foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency bonds etc. The non-convertible bonds/debentures are raised by the Company under public issue route or through private placement basis.\n\nIn addition to capital expenditure requirement as explained above, Company also needs to borrow for meeting its working capital requirement and other general corporate purpose which is partly proposed to be met through issuance of non-convertible bonds.\n\nThe provisions of Section 42 of Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 14(1) of the Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 require the Company to seek a Special Resolution from its shareholders for raising the NCDs on private placement basis. However, in case of offer or invitation for 'non-convertible debentures', it shall be sufficient, if the Company passes a previous Special Resolution only once in a year for all the offers or invitations for such debentures during the year.\n\nIn view of the above, approval of the Shareholders of the Company is being sought to authorize the Board of Directors to make offer(s) or invitation(s) to subscribe to the secured/unsecured, redeemable, taxable/tax-free, cumulative/non-cumulative, non-convertible debentures ('Bonds') up to ' 18,000 Crore in one or more tranches/series not exceeding 30 (thirty), through private placement, in domestic market for capex, working capital and general corporate purposes during the period commencing from the date of passing of Special Resolution till completion of one year thereof or the date of next Annual General Meeting in the financial year 2022-23 whichever is earlier, subject to ceiling approved by the shareholders under Section 180(1)(c) of Companies Act, 2013.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company in its Meeting held on 31 st July 2021 has approved the proposal and recommends the passing of the proposed Special Resolution.\n\nThe Directors or key managerial personnel or their relatives do not have concern or interest, financial or otherwise, in passing of the said Special Resolution, except to the extent of their shareholding in the Company.\n\nBy order of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tariff of electricity generated from various stations of your Company is in the process of determination by CERC based on stationspecific petitions filed as per these Regulations for the above-mentioned period. Further, CERC has also issued the First Amendment to Tariff Regulations, 2019 regarding servicing of capital and operational expenditure incurred on installation and operation of Emission Control Systems through determination of supplementary capacity charges and supplementary energy charges. CERC has also issued Second Amendment to the Tariff Regulations, 2019 regarding determination of transfer price of coal from captive coal mines by the generating company.\n\n## 6.5 Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED)\n\n- 1.  The mechanism of Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) is under implementation on Pilot basis starting from 1.4.2019. This mechanism helps in optimization of total schedule of the Inter State Generating  Stations  based  on  the  variable  cost, resulting in savings in cost of procurement for the Discoms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2.    Starting from 1.6.2020, this Pilot has been extended twice by CERC, first till 31.3.2021 and then again till 30.9.2021. During these periods, the scope of the SCED has been expanded to include the state regulated  generating  stations  and  the  merchant generators based on their willingness to participate in the scheme.\n- 3.  SCED has resulted in cumulative savings of ' 1660 crore in generation cost from start of the SCED pilot in April 2019 up to March 2021 thereby resulting in increased saving in the cost of power procurement of the Discoms.\n- 4.    The  generating  stations  of  your  Company  are participating in the SCED mechanism starting from April 2019 and contributing in a significant way in reduction in power purchase cost of the Discoms.\n\n## 6.6 Strengthening Customer Relationship\n\nCustomer  Focus  is  one  of  the  core  values  of  your Company (ICOMIT). In line with this, your Company has taken up several initiatives targeted towards the external Customers.  Customer  Relationship  Management  (CRM) and Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) are some of the important parts of these initiatives.\n\nAs part of the CRM, your Company has been implementing several  structured  activities  with  the  objective  of sharing  its  experiences  and  best  practices  with  the customers, capturing their feedbacks and expectations and addressing their issues. Some of these activities are described below:\n\n- -Your Company provides various support services to the beneficiaries, which involves identifying potential areas of cooperation and sharing of each other's best practices. In the financial year 2020-21, total 8 such programs have been conducted for the customers on the basis of requirement expressed by them.\n- -Your  Company  offers  training  programs  to  the representatives of beneficiary companies at Power Management Institute (PMI), the apex training institute of your Company on free of cost basis. In 2020-21, 18 participants from various customer organizations attended training in 5 programs.\n- -Your  Company  has  also  put  in  place  Customer Satisfaction  Index  (CSI)  Survey  scheme,  to  gather customer's feedbacks through a survey and respond to  their  requirements.  This  CSI  survey  has  been conducted  in  2020-21  and  the  score  falls  under excellent category.\n\n## 6.7 Power Trading in Power Exchange\n\nIn  line  with  CERC  (IEGC)  (5 th Amendment)  Regulations 2017, a generating company can sell the un-requisitioned surplus (URS) power based on consent of the beneficiary states. The gains realized from the sale of URS are to be shared with beneficiaries in the ratio of 50:50, subject to a cap of 7 paisa per kwh for the generators as per applicable provisions.",

The  main objective of Real Time Market (RTM) is to provide a market mechanism to the generating stations to sell their surplus power in the market. This also provides an opportunity to the Discoms to buy power from the market to meet their contingent requirements. For generators, to sell their URS in the RTM, no consent is required from the beneficiaries. RTM is being implemented in the form of 48 half-hourly auctions  conducted  during  the  delivery  date  and provides options to the generators and the Discoms to participate in the market through price sensitive bidding. The gain sharing principle remains same as that the URS sale in the Day Ahead Market (DAM).\n\nYour Company has been participating in both the DAM and the RTM for selling URS power in the Power Exchange through its trading arm NVVN. Besides selling the URS power, it has also been selling any regulated power or merchant power also in the Power Exchanges. In the FY 2020-21, around 920 Million Units of power has been sold in the DAM and RTM in Power Exchanges. Corresponding gains for this sale has been shared with the beneficiaries as per the extant regulatory provisions.\n\n## 6.9 Renewable Energy:\n\n## 1.

Generator Transformer  &  Switchyard  Package  is  completed. Powerhouse works are completed and architectural works are in progress. Erection and testing of three out of four turbines is completed.\n- On the morning of 7.2.2021, there was a massive glacial outburst, avalanching into Rishiganga River. This  caused  an  unprecedented,  devastating  flash flood in the river consisting of debris, silt, boulders, ice, rock pieces, soil, trees etc. Due to this debris flow,  huge  quantity  of  muck  got  deposited  in Barrage area, Desilting Chambers, Intake structure, Head Race Tunnel, Silt Flushing Tunnel, HRT Adits etc. entrapping the manpower and equipment/vehicles in these areas engaged for the purpose of ongoing work.  Rescue  operation  was  started  immediately with the help of ITBP, Army, NDRF, SDRF and Govt of  Uttarakhand.  Presently  rescue  and  restoration works are under progress in all the affected areas. It includes muck removal from tunnels and desilting Chamber,  River  diversion  from  left  to  right  bank, creating embankment/Bund  to  prevent  further flooding in Monsoon and rectification of damaged roads, on priority.

The contraction in the economy is primarily due to the prevailing pandemic and this being a global phenomenon; the contraction is comparable to that of other developing economies.\n\nAs per World Economic Outlook Update, released by IMF in January 2021, the growth projection for India for the year 2021 is highest (11.5%) as against that for the other BRICS countries, i.e., Brazil (3.6%), Russia (3.0%), China (8.3%) & South Africa (2.8%). As per Monetary Policy Report of RBI published in April 2021, the real GDP growth for the financial year 2021-22 is estimated to be 10.50%.\n\nQuarterly growth rate analysis shows that during Q1 (AprilJune) of the financial year 2020-21, GDP contracted to the extent of (-) 23.92%, but it started improving in the subsequent quarters. Growth rate was (-) 7.54% during Q2, 0.4% during Q3 and 1.6% during Q4 of the financial year 2020-21. The growth seems to be in line with growth projections made by IMF and RBI for the coming year.\n\nFor the electricity sector, Index of Industrial Production (IIP) has declined by 17.64% (average) from April to August with respect  to  previous  year;  however,  it  has  grown  by  11% (average) during the balance period of the financial year 202021. On annual basis, electricity sector has contracted 0.5% while the mining and manufacturing sectors have declined by (-) 7.8% & (-) 9.8% respectively during the financial year 202021. With economy projected to look up, IIP is very much likely to turn around.\n\nFurther, the outlook of the sector seems positive as represented through improvement in various global rankings. India's overall rank in World Bank's 'Ease of Doing Business' is 63 rd in 2020, improving from a rank of 142 nd in 2015. Indian Power Sector has also improved its ranking to 22 nd in 2020 from earlier ranking of 137 th in 2015 in 'Getting Electricity', which is one of the ten parameters of 'Ease of Doing Business' ranking.\n\nDuring the financial year 2020-21, the major reforms in the electricity sector are:\n\n- \uf0a7 Revision of National Electricity Policy 2021, with a focus on improving DISCOMs' financial viability, promotion of clean  and  sustainable  power  and  development  of  an efficient electricity market. Emphasis has also been put on 'Make in India' and 'ATMANIRBHAR Bharat'.\n\nAnnexure-I to Directors' Report\n\n- \uf0a7 National  Electricity  Plan  2022, for  integrated  planning of  generation  capacity,  transmission,  fuel  management, human resources and fund requirements with detailed plan until 2027 and perspective until 2032.\n- \uf0a7 20 th Electric Power Survey (EPS), for projection of electricity demand from the financial year 2021-22 to 2031-32 (yearwise) and for terminal years 2036-37 and 2041-42.\n- \uf0a7 Amendment of Electricity Act, with proposed elements such as formulation of National Renewable Energy Policy, setting up of Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority, Tariff determination with direct benefit transfer (DBT) of subsidy by State Governments.\n- \uf0a7 Implementation of Payment Security Mechanism through LC and Smart Metering.\n- \uf0a7 Electricity  (Late  Payment  Surcharge)  rules  2021, to support the DISCOMs financially and for timely payment to Generators.\n- \uf0a7 Electricity (Right of Consumers) Rules 2020, for integration of the distributed renewable generation.\n\nThese reforms are likely to help the sector's growth in terms of renewable capacity, increase in investment in the sector, improvement in the health of DISCOMs, reduction in pending receivables of the generating companies etc.\n\nSince March 2020, COVID 19 has affected the sector in terms of reduction in electricity demand due to countrywide lockdown and slow-down of industrial activities. However, during the 3 rd quarter of the financial year 2020-21, the growth in peak demand turned positive with an increase of 4.4% on YoY basis and electricity demand increased by 8.4% to reach 317 BUs as compared to 293 BUs for the same period of the previous year.\n\n## INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS\n\nPower sector is a key enabler for India's economic growth. The sector with its three pillars: generation, transmission and distribution, is crucial to India's infrastructure and economic development.  The  global  stature  of  Indian  Power  Sector is  depicted  well  by  its  positioning  in  terms  of  generation capacity. India is ranked 3 rd in the world in terms of electricity generation,  4 th in  installed  renewable  energy  capacity  and 6 th in installed hydro capacity, as reported by international agencies like IEA, Statista, IRENA etc. The achievements and various issues/ challenges faced by the Power Sector and key initiatives undertaken by Ministry of Power are discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\n## Snapshot 2020-21\n\n- \u00b7 Gross annual generation of the country (including import from  Bhutan  and  including  renewables)  decreased\n\n<!-- image -->",

Out of remaining 17,337 un-electrified & partially electrified villages, infrastructure work has been completed in 16,752 villages (97%) while physical work has been completed in 10 out of 15 districts.\n\nThe  total  electricity  consumption  in  India  decreased  to 1,271 BUs in the financial year 2020-21 from 1,284 BUs in the previous year, mainly due to slowdown in economy due to the pandemic.\n\nMajor  end  users  of  power  are  broadly  classified  into  six categories:  Agricultural,  Commercial,  Domestic,  Industrial, Traction & Railways and Others.  Their shares of electricity consumption,  during  2019-20,  were  approximately  17.7%, 8.1%,  24%,  42.7%,  1.5%  and  6%,  respectively.  During  the financial year 2020-21, because of lockdown affecting the economic  activities,  the  consumption  share  of  different sectors have gone through significant variations. For example, share of domestic consumption has increased significantly to about 36% whereas share of industry has reduced to about 32%.\n\n## Transmission\n\nThe total inter-regional transmission capacity of country has increased from 75,050 MW at the end of 12 th plan to 105,050 MW as on 31 March 2021, with an average growth rate of 10% in last 4 years. During the financial year 2020-21, 3,000 MW  inter-regional  transmission  capacity  was  added.  This augmentation of the national grid is essential for supporting higher injection of renewables into the grid for transfer of power from RE rich states to other states.\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistribution is the key link in realizing the Government of India's vision of supplying reliable 24x7 Power for All. For this, the financial health of distribution companies is of prime importance so that they are able to discharge their functions &  responsibilities  efficiently.  Slowdown  in  the  economy induced  by  the  pandemic  and  subsequent  decrease  in industrial power demand has adversely affected DISCOMs on this aspect.\n\nTo  improve  the  situation,  Government  of  India  (GOI) has  provided  a  stimulus  of ' 90,000  crore  under  the ATMANIRBHAR  Bharat  scheme.  Further,  under  the  Union Budget for the financial year 2021-22, a performance linked power distribution scheme has been launched with an outlay of ' 3,05,984 crore over a period of five years to aid DISCOMs in infrastructure creation including pre-paid smart-metering, feeder separation and upgradation of systems.\n\nElectricity  (Amendment)  Bill,  2021  proposes  amendments for adoption of de-licensing and franchise model for power distribution business to bring in competition.  These steps are likely to reduce Average Cost of Supply-Average Realisable Revenue (ACS-ARR) gap and AT&C losses resulting in improved financial health of DISCOMs.\n\nNational Electricity Policy 2021, which is under revision by\n\nMinistry of Power, also emphasises on improving the financial viability of DISCOMs.\n\n## Power Trading\n\nIn India, power is transacted largely through long term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) entered into, between Generating companies and the Distribution utilities. A small portion is transacted through various short-term mechanisms wherein the contract is of less than one-year period like electricity transacted through inter-State Trading Licensees and directly by  the  Distribution  Licensees,  power  exchanges  such  as Indian Energy Exchange Ltd. (IEX) and Power Exchange India Ltd. (PXIL) and Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM).\n\nIn the financial year 2020-21, around 88% of power generated in the country was transacted through the long-term PPA route and about 12% of the power was transacted through short-term trading mechanisms.\n\nKey  Initiatives/Reforms  &  Regulatory  Changes  in  Power Sector\n\n## 1. CERC Regulations\n\n- \u00b7  CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2019 notified on 7 March 2019, which are applicable for the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2024. The tariff  of  electricity  generated  from  various  NTPC stations is determined by CERC, based on stationspecific petitions filed before the Commission, as per these Regulations.\n- \u00b7 CERC (Terms & Conditions of Tariff) (1 st Amendment) Regulations, 2020 regarding servicing of capital and operational  expenditure  incurred  on  installation and operation of Emission Control Systems through determination  of  supplementary  capacity  charges and supplementary energy charges.\n- \u00b7 CERC (Terms & Conditions of Tariff) (2 nd Amendment) Regulations, 2020 regarding determination of transfer price of coal from captive coal mines by the generating company.\n- \u00b7 CERC (Sharing of Inter State Transmission Charges and Losses) Regulations, 2020 effective from 1 November 2020. These regulations provide the framework for sharing of interstate transmission charges and losses by the various users.\n\n## 2. Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO) targets\n\nTo  achieve  175  GW  of  renewable  capacity  by  2022, Ministry of Power in consultation with MNRE has notified RPO  trajectory.  For  the  financial  year  2020-21,  RPO targets were set at 19% (8.75% for Solar and 10.25% for Non-Solar renewables).\n\nFor  the  financial  year  2021-22,  RPO  target  of  21.18% comprising  of  10.50%  Solar  and  10.68%  Non-Solar renewables  including  0.18%  hydro  has  been  notified. Further, a committee has been constituted by MNRE to",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndefine RPO trajectory beyond the financial year 2021-22.\n\nWith  the  objective  of  adding  more  than  30,000  MW hydropower  by  the  financial  year  2029-30,  MOP  has also introduced Hydro Purchase Obligation (HPO) and specified long-term trajectory of HPO from the financial year 2021-22 to 2029-30. To achieve these targets, large hydro  plants  including  pumped  storage  plants  having capacity of more than 25 MW & commissioned after 8 March 2019 have been declared as renewable energy plants.\n\n## 3. Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021\n\nThe  Central  Government  has  notified  the  Electricity (Late  Payment  Surcharge)  Rules,  2021  applicable  to Power  Purchase  Agreements  (PPAs),  Power  Supply Agreements (PSAs) and Transmission Service Agreements (TSAs), where tariff is determined under Section-62 and Section-63 of the Electricity Act.\n\nThese rules provide for a graded late payment surcharge, applicable  on  outstanding  amounts  beyond  the  due date.  This  rule  will  reduce  the  burden  on  DISCOMs without affecting payment discipline as it has provision for debarment of DISCOMs from procuring power from a power exchange or grant of short-term open access if the dues remain unpaid beyond seven months.\n\n## 4. Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020\n\nElectricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 has been notified in December 2020 to protect the rights of the consumers.  It  specifies  time  limits  for  giving  various services to electricity consumers by DISCOMs.\n\nThese rules provide a framework for 'prosumers' to set up distributed renewable energy generation units either by themselves or through a service provider. Guidelines for  smart  meters,  online  bill  payments,  reliability  and quality of service, compensation & penalties for delay in service have also been provided.\n\nAfter  notification  of  above  rules,  MOP  has  proposed amendment to net metering limit i.e., up to 500KW or sanctioned load (whichever is lower). The amendment is aimed at promoting prosumers further.\n\n## 5. Green Term Ahead Market (GTAM)\n\nAs a first step towards greening the Indian short-term power market, GOI has launched Green Term Ahead Market (GTAM) in electricity on 1 September 2020. This allows an additional avenue to the generators for sale of renewable energy; enable obligated entities to procure renewable power at competitive prices to meet their Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO).\n\nGTAM transactions are bilateral with clear identification of corresponding buyers and sellers. GTAM contracts are segregated into Solar RPO & Non-Solar RPO and within the two segments GTAM contracts consist of Green Intraday, Day Ahead Contingency, Daily and Weekly Contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6. Waiver of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses\n\nThe Ministry of Power vide its order dated 15 January 2021 has provided that no ISTS charges will be levied on transmission of the electricity generated from solar and wind power plants (including solar-wind hybrid) with or without storage, commissioned up to 30 June 2023.\n\nThis  waiver  shall  be  applicable  for  power  sale  to distribution licensees, irrespective of whether this power is within the RPO or not, provided that the power has been procured competitively under the guidelines issued by the MOP.\n\nPower from such solar and wind plants may also be used for charging of storage including Hydro pumped storage plants. The waiver shall be applicable for twenty-five years from commissioning of such projects.\n\n## 7. Coal allocation for short term power procurement\n\nIn December 2019, Government had issued guidelines for Coal supply to power plants which (including private generators) do not have PPAs. These guidelines allow Coal Linkage to such plants through auction for a period of three months to one year, provided further that the power  generated  through  that  linkage  is  sold  in  Day Ahead Market (DAM) through power exchanges or in short  term  by  a  transparent  bidding  process  through Discovery of Efficient Energy Price (DEEP) portal.\n\nFurther, on 12 May 2020, the Government has relaxed the eligibility criteria for participation in the coal linkage auction, permitting any commissioned power plant (single unit or multiple units located in the same premise) owned by Government or Private Companies for the capacity for which no PPA has been signed.\n\n## 8. Real Time Market (RTM)\n\nCERC has introduced Real Time Market (RTM) in electricity from June 2020, with a financially and physically binding framework in place. This real time market is likely to provide an alternate mechanism for DISCOMs to access a larger market. It provides for power transactions with separate  market  clearing  price  and  market  clearing volume for each time block of 15 minutes.\n\nThe generators having long-term contract and participating in this market for selling their un-requisitioned surplus (URS) power are required to share the net gains with the DISCOMs in the ratio of 50:50 subject to a cap of 7p/kWh.\n\n## 9.  Utilization of Agro-residue for power generation & to reduce pollution\n\nThe  Government  has  taken  initiatives  to  utilize  Agroresidue for power generation. This is intended to reduce emissions  by  discouraging  farmers  from  burning  crop residue and to provide extra income to them through sale of crop residue.",

Draft National Mission on use of Biomass is initiated by MOP to institutionalize the use of Biomass as a fuel. The mission will work on logistics, regulatory framework, and research on boiler modification to enable biomass firing.\n\n## 10.  Sale of 50% coal from captive blocks\n\nThrough  the  notified  amendment  in  the  Mines  and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, the Government has relaxed the norms for sale of coal from captive mines. The amendment provides for sale of up to fifty percent of coal production from the captive mine after meeting the requirement of the linked end use plant. This will help in reduction in import of coal by increasing the production from captive mines.\n\n## OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS/CHALLENGES\n\n## OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## 1. Renewable Energy (RE)\n\nGovernment of India has targeted to achieve 175 GW of RE capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by the year 2030.

At least one charging station shall be installed in a grid of 3 km x 3 km, charging stations are also proposed on major highways at an interval of about 25 km.\n\nYour  Company  is  envisaging  providing  hydrogen  and pure electric powertrain based green mobility solutions for public transport, which includes providing hydrogen fuel cell based electric vehicles as well as pure batteryoperated electric buses. It is also playing an important role of e-Mobility 'enabler' by creating a favourable ecosystem.\n\nYour Company plans to set-up 400 Chargers for creating charging  infrastructure  at  various  locations  across the  country.  So  far,  90  Chargers  have  been  installed and  balance  are  under  progress.  Your  Company  has commissioned a pilot project on the concept of battery charging and swapping at Faridabad for e-3wheelers. Your  Company's  subsidiary  NVVN,  is  also  offering complete e-bus solutions to state transport units.\n\n## Green mobility in Ladakh and Delhi\n\nBesides  battery-based  E-mobility,  your  Company  also has plans to enter green Mobility business. Pilot projects based on green hydrogen are planned to be carried out in Leh and Delhi with 5 nos. of Fuel cell electric bus and 5 nos. of fuel cell cars at each location. An EOI has been invited in this regard from Global FCEV (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle) manufacturers.\n\nDelhi has been chosen to set up hydrogen filling stations so that intercity transport using FCEV buses is supported. MOUs are being planned with UT, Ladakh and Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) for allied green hydrogen initiatives and setting up hydrogen filling stations.\n\nThrough  these  steps  your  Company  envisages  to contribute towards low carbon pathway.\n\n## 2. Cross Border Power Trading\n\nThe  guidelines  issued  by  MOP,  CERC  regulations  and Procedure for Approval from the Designated Authority for cross border trading of power has opened opportunities to export power to neighbouring countries. Presently, India  exports  electricity  to  Nepal,  Bangladesh  and Myanmar. India imports power from Bhutan, but exports power during lean hydro season.\n\nGOI has assigned NVVN, a subsidiary of your Company, the role of Nodal Agency for cross border trading of power.  GOI  has  also  nominated  NVVN  as  Settlement Nodal Agency (SNA) for settlement of Grid operation related  charges  with  neighbouring  countries,  namely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar. Accordingly, NVVN has signed SNA agreement with Nepal Electricity Authority while SNA agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board shall be signed shortly.\n\nNVVN has signed various Power Purchase Agreements with  Bangladesh  and  Nepal  aggregating  to  710  MW and 350 MW respectively. NVVN has received LOI from Bangladesh Power Development Board on 31 January 2020 for supply of 500 MW power from GMR Upper Karnali Hydro Power Project, Nepal to Bangladesh. PPA for the same is being finalised.\n\nNVVN has commenced the Cross Border Electricity Trade (CBET) in power exchange platform by supplying power to Nepal Electricity Authority through platform of Indian Energy Exchange (IEX).  This is a first of its kind initiative by your Company and would help in further expanding its cross-border portfolio.\n\n## 3.

Solar and Wind Power - capacity growth:\n\nTo integrate variable RE into the grid, coal-based power plants must regulate their generation to maintain grid balance. Therefore, influx of more RE power in the grid would  require  many  coal-based  plants  to  operate  at technical minimum capacity, frequent load fluctuations and two shift operations. This will result in lower efficiency at  partial  load  leading  to  higher  cost  of  generation. Other factors like cost for balancing services, reduced life due to flexible operation of thermal plant would also adversely affect the cost of generation.\n\nFurther, imposition of basic customs duty on imported solar cells (25%) and modules (40%) starting from 1 April 2022 will increase the prices of solar panels. Disruption of supply chain due to pandemic has also slowed down the solar capacity addition.",

Environmental Concerns:\n\nThe  environmental  concerns,  particularly  relating  to coal based thermal stations, have emerged as a major challenge to the sector. To comply with new standards for  water  consumption,  PM,  SOx,  NOx  and  mercury, thermal power plants need to install emission control equipment like FGDs (Flue Gas de-sulphurisation), SCRs (Selective Catalytic Reduction) / SNCRs (Selective NonCatalytic Reduction), DSI (Dry Sorbent Injection) along with necessary combustion modifications and retrofitting of ESPs (Electrostatic Precipitator).\n\nThe  cost  of  retrofitting  appropriate  systems  to  meet these norms will have adverse impact on tariff and merit order scheduling. Logistics and supply chain for sourcing the consumables and disposing of the waste generated impose additional challenges.\n\nFurther, as per new environment norms, all plants must achieve 100% ash utilization in a three-year cycle with a grace period of a year in the 'first compliance' cycle if the percentage of ash utilisation is between 60-80% and two years if it is below 60% as accounted during the financial year 2021-22.\n\n## 3. Non-availability of Gas\n\nAvailability  of  GOI  allocated  domestic  gas  has  been declining. Further, due to high reserve price and onerous terms & conditions, Power sector is unable to tie up new domestic gas from KG basin. Gas stations are dependent upon costlier RLNG for declaring capacity. This leads to higher costs and thus lower PLF. The gas-based plants of your Company are also under threat due to insufficient gas availability.\n\n## 4. Threat due to COVID-19:\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has repeatedly affected the entire world and India is no exception to it, particularly during the second wave of pandemic, India is amongst the worst affected  countries.  The  electricity  consumption,  being dependent on the economic activities in the country, had seen a dip in the demand during the period of lockdown in the first two quarters of the financial year.\n\nCOVID-19 has also affected the supply chain, workforce availability,  land  acquisition  and  cash  flows  of  your Company,  which  may  affect  the  timely  execution  of the  under-construction  projects.  COVID-19  pandemic is declared as a force majeure by the Government of India, the threat being an external one and affecting the entire nation, your Company's business may be adversely affected in near future.\n\nElectricity  being  an  essential  service,  your  Company has supplied uninterrupted electricity to the country to support various relief measures. For this, the company has taken various proactive and preventive steps like SOPs  for  workplace  and  townships,  monitoring  and tracking mechanism for COVID, communication etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe top management of your Company has been involved in monitoring the situation on continuous basis regarding the  steps  to  prevent  and  control  effects  of  COVID, extension and upgrading of medical facility like KAWACH, telemedicine, establishing COVID  wards,  facilitating vaccine drives and various other measures.\n\nFurther to support the sector, deferment of capacity charges has been made to provide relief to DISCOMs during COVID.

The  increase over  last  financial  year  was  due  to  increase  in  long-term borrowings. Total borrowings as at 31 March 2021 were ' 1,61,628.87 crore in comparison to ' 1,52,693.62 crore as at 31 March 2020. For the financial year 2020-21, the average cost of borrowing has decreased to 6.24% from 6.81% in the previous year. The decrease in the average cost of borrowing is because of lower rate of interest on new borrowings.\n\nFinance  costs  due  to  commercial  papers  however  have decreased from ' 865.54 crore to ' 556.95 crore. Exchange differences regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs (net of amount transferred to EDC) has also decreased significantly from ' 271.30 crore to (-) ' 240.00 crore due to strengthening of INR against USD & JPY.\n\nFor the financial year 2020-21, an amount of ' 2,511.77 crore relating to finance costs of projects under construction was capitalized while the corresponding amount for the previous year  was ' 4,182.54  crore.  In  addition,  finance  cost  of ' 268.52 crore has been capitalized in respect of development of coal mines as against ' 227.74 crore in the previous year.\n\n## 2.4 Depreciation and amortization expense (Note 39)\n\nThe depreciation and amortization expense charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the financial year 2020-21 was ' 10,411.80 crore as compared to ' 8,622.85 crore in the financial year 2019-20, registering an increase of ~21%. This is due to increase in the gross PPE by ' 18,659.35 crore in the financial year 2020-21 over the previous year.\n\nThe increase in gross block is largely on account of increase in commercial capacity by 2,490 MW resulting in additional capitalization on account of commercial declaration of new units. The depreciation on new units capitalized during the year is on pro-rata basis. Further, depreciation for units declared commercial during financial year 2019-20 aggregating to 3,970 MW has been charged for the entire financial year 2020-21 as against a pro-rata charge during the financial year 2019-20. The impact on depreciation on this account for the financial year 2020-21 is ' 1,344.13 crore.\n\nAs per the accounting policy of the Company, depreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company except the assets of Solar / Wind Power plants which are not governed by CERC Regulations,  is charged on straight line method following the rates and methodology notified by the CERC Tariff Regulations in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 and depreciation on the assets of the oil & gas exploration and consultancy business, is charged on straight line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. In respect of assets of Solar /Wind power plants which are\n\nnot covered by CERC regulations, depreciation is charged on straight line method over the useful life of 25 year as technically assessed by the management.\n\nIn  case  of  certain  assets,  the  Company  has  continued  to charge higher depreciation based on technical assessment of useful life of those assets.\n\n## 2.5 Exceptional Items (Note 43)\n\nThe Company is in the business of generation and sale of electricity, which is an essential service as emphasized by MOP, GOI. During the outbreak of COVID-19, the Company has ensured the availability of its power plants to generate power and has continued to supply power during the period of lockdown. In line with the directions of MOP dated 15 & 16 May 2020, issued in accordance with the announcement of GOI under the ATMANIRBHAR Bharat Special Economic and Comprehensive package, Company had allowed a rebate of  between  20%-25%  on  the  capacity  charges  during  the lock down period amounting to ' 1,363.00 crore. The entire amount  has  since  been  accounted  for  and  disclosed  as exceptional item.\n\n## 2.6 Net movement in regulatory deferral account balance (Net of tax) (Note 64)\n\nThe Company is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity.  The  price  to  be  charged  by  the  Company  for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC, which  provides  extensive  guidance  on  the  principles  and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return. This form of rate regulation is known  as  cost-of-service  regulations,  which  provide  the Company  to  recover  its  costs  of  providing  the  goods  or services plus a fair return.\n\nExchange  differences  arising  from  settlement/  translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent  recoverable  from  or  payable  to  the  beneficiaries in  subsequent  periods  as  per  CERC  Tariff  Regulations  are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Movements in regulatory deferral account balances' during construction period and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of (-) ' 382.42 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2021 including amount refunded has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2020: ' 1,202.93 crore)\n\nConsidering  the  methodology  followed  by  the  CERC  for allowing impact of the previous pay revision, various tariff orders  issued  by  the  CERC  under  Regulations,  2014  and the provisions related to the change in law of CERC Tariff",

This has been taken up with CERC through truing up tariff petition. No amount has been accounted for in this regard in the current year as well as in the previous year since the asset has been created up to 31 March 2019.\n\nCERC Regulations provide that deferred tax liability up to 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,437.85 crore (31 March 2020: ' 4,000.77 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2021 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n\nThe  petition  filed  by  the  Company  before  CERC  for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash has been favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual additional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016, subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset has been created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there is shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,003.79 crore (31 March 2020: ' 647.57 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2021 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n\nCERC  Regulations  provide  that  the  capital  expenditure  in respect of existing generating station incurred /projected to be incurred, inter-alia, towards liabilities to meet award of arbitration (i) within the original scope of work after the COD up to the cut-off date (Regulations 24); (ii) within the original scope of work and after the cut-off date (Regulations 25); and (iii) beyond the original scope of work (Regulation 26), will be admitted by CERC subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory deferral account debit balance has been accounted corresponding to the amount debited to Statement of profit & loss in respect of arbitration cases amounting to ' 110.81 crore (31 March 2020: Nil) for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nAccordingly, for the financial year 2020-21, net movement in regulatory deferral account balances (net of tax) is ' 1,779.39\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncrore  whereas  for  the  financial  year  2019-20, ' 4,828.84 crore was recognized as net movement in regulatory deferral account balances (net of tax).\n\n- 3.

Accordingly, excess tax provision created in the previous year pursuant to VsVs, amounting to ' 1,889.05 crores has been written back during the year.

We conduct this exercise on regular time intervals (gap of 3-4 years) owing to significant change in business processes, external environment, geographical expansion, Global Mega Trends etc. A structured methodology has been adopted for materiality assessment on engagement with both internal and external stakeholders. The details about methodology and engagements undertaken can be accessed from NTPC's website.\n\nWe  undertook  a  materiality  assessment  methodology  in FY 2018-19 in accordance with the IIRC Framework and GRI Standards through a credible third party. This exercise was helpful  in  prioritising  inputs  from  relevant  stakeholders,  as mentioned in earlier (Stakeholder) section, through continuous interactions, into NTPC's decision making process. Our material topics also provide further insights into the challenges, risks and opportunities our Company might face as described in the  subsequent  chapter  (Risk  Management)  of  this  report. Effective  management  of  material  issues  is  critical  to  our business sustainability as it directs our strategic planning and management priorities towards achieving the ultimate goal of long-term sustainable value creation for our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To effectively manage the risks associated with the business, NTPC has taken adequate measures  to  institutionalize  risk  management  process  by implementing  a  companywide  elaborate  Enterprise  Risk Management (ERM) framework.\n\nAs part of the ERM framework, a Functional Director level Subcommittee of the Board, called Risk Management Committee (RMC) has been constituted. RMC has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks and formulate strategies and action plans for risk mitigation on short-term as well as long-term basis. The objective of the process is to improve risk awareness and manage the Company's risk\n\nexposure. The details about members of Risk Management Committee can be found at page no. 114.\n\nNTPC's  risk  assessment  method  is  based  on  a  sustainable business model analysing risks in a broader framework and incorporating social and environmental issues with economic considerations. The identified risks are then prioritised and action plans are developed at enterprise level by RMC.\n\nThe company endeavours to mitigate these risks in a timely manner. Further, NTPC attempts to leverage risks and convert them  into  opportunities,  thereby  enhancing  Company's competitive advantage.\n\nThe process of risk identification is guided by the Company's objectives,  external  environment,  industry  reports,  internal stakeholders  etc.  The  risk  identification  process  covers the  whole  gamut  of  risks,  including  strategic,  tactical  and operational.\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of risks and formulation of action plan and strategies to mitigate them\n- \u00b7 Implementation of risk management plan\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and review of risk management plan\n- \u00b7 Informing the Board about assessed risks and required actions on quarterly basis\n- \u00b7 Take up any other matter as directed by the Board from time to time\n\nNTPC Bongaigaon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoles and responsibilities of the Risk Management Committee",

The risks associated with the increase in sea  levels,  water  stress  situations,  increased heat waves, erratic rainfall and frequent natural disasters may impact the business.\n\nRising climate change concerns and threats may bring  future  policy  and  regulatory  risks  in terms  of carbon tax  and cess.\n\n## Water Availability\n\nWater  has  become  a  significant  risk  area due  to  increasing  pressure  on  the  already stressed  available  water  resources.  Reducing water  availability,  its  increasing  costs  and stricter regulatory regime is posing risks to our operations.\n\nVarious  water  conservation  initiatives  with  process  improvements  and technology adoption have been taken up by NTPC. Some of the key steps are; Optimisation of cycles of concentration (COC) and implementation of ZLD at all stations to reduce fresh water consumption, Adoption of Air Cooled Condenser (ACC) based cooling in projects located in water stressed locations etc. Dry bottom ash system is being adopted at new plants to save water.\n\nDry Ash Evacuation System (DAES) & High Concentration Slurry Discharge (HCSD) technology are also used to minimize use of water in Ash handling.\n\n## Business growth and diversification\n\nWith  the  rising  economic  growth  attributed to  rapid urbanisation  and  increased  industry production,  the electricity  demand  is  poised to keep  growing.  Power  generating  units needs to  ramp  up  their  production to meet the  increasing  demand.  Also,  to  ensure  the profitability  and  future  cash  flows,  power companies need to diversify their business and increase global footprint.\n\nNTPC group has added commercial capacity of 3,824 MW in FY-21 (commercial capacity as on 31.03.21 is 64,490 MW as against 61,126 MW as on 31.03.20).\n\nAs a part of its growth plan, NTPC has been looking for opportunities for acquisition of power plants including efficient, low carbon based thermal and renewable plants which makes business prudence for the Company. The Company has already diversified into renewables, consultancy services, EV ecosystem and waste to energy management. In this regard, NTPC has bagged the tender for supply of Electric Buses to BMTC Bengaluru and Andaman. Business opportunities of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) in Delhi and Leh for inter and intra city travel are being explored.\n\nTo develop & operate integrated waste management & energy generation facility,  NTPC  has  incorporated  a  JV  Company  with  East  Delhi  Municipal Corporation (EDMC). In addition, a tri-partite MoU amongst NTPC, IOCL and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) for developing Waste to Energy (WtE) facility at Okhla Landfill site has also been signed.\n\nNTPC Kayamkulam\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNTPC has an enhanced geographical and technology diversification. NTPC operate across more than 73 locations in India and abroad, inherently reducing our risks to any individual location specific natural catastrophe. As part of our preparedness against such situations, our power plants and infrastructure is designed to withstand cyclones, cooling systems to withstand the increase in water temperatures brought forth by climate change.\n\nTo de-risk our business from transition risk, we are making substantial progress  towards  decarbonised  energy  transition  through  increase penetration of renewables in our portfolio. We have installed 5 GW of non-fossil based generation capacity till date and strive to achieve 60 GW of same by 2032.",

The wastes generated from our processes are either recycled into useful materials, used as raw material for another industry or are disposed / processed as per regulations. We are in the process of forward and  backward  integration  of  our  core  business  of  power generation through development of coal mines for captive use, and acquisition of companies involved in power generation business. No disruptive changes took place in our supply chain during the reporting year. Incremental changes in our overall business processes are reported in the relevant sections. We are continuously evolving our business model to broaden value creation for our various stakeholders. Integrated planning and execution is at the core of this evolution from business model to a 'value creation' model. We base our 'value creation' model on six 'capitals' which serve as a stock for our inputs.\n\nFor each of the inputs withdrawn, we add elements of value for  our  stakeholders  through  our  business  processes  & functions  in  tandem  with  the  external  environment  and our mission, vision and core values. This is enabled through strategy formulation, risk identification, resource allocation and periodic performance monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORTING",

With 1350 MW of installed renewable capacity, NTPC has ventured into large-scale deployment of RE assets and is looking forward to achieve 60 GW of renewable power capacity by 2032. We have hived off  our RE business and have incorporated a new company 'NTPC Renewable Energy Limited' (NREL) to bring focus and speed in timely implementation of renewable projects.\n\nWe are working on tenders for more than 4 GW, taking the total  renewable  capacity  under  construction  to  2884  MW. During the reporting year, our non-fossil electricity generation (including solar, hydro, wind & small hydropower) was 13.22 BU, which is an increase of 168% over previous year. Along with its own projects, NTPC has been facilitating solar projects in Developer Mode and acts as an intermediary procurer where it procures power from the Developers and sells to DISCOMs with a trading margin. Break-up of NTPC solar projects as on date under various stages has been provided below:\n\n| Description           | NTPC Group EPC  Mode's Own Projects  (8382 MW)   | NTPC Group EPC  Mode's Own Projects  (8382 MW)   | NTPC Group EPC  Mode's Own Projects  (8382 MW)   | Developer  Mode  Projects  (6743 MW)   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                       | NTPC                                             | NTPC  REL                                        | THDC &  NEEPCO                                   | NTPC                                   |\n| Commissioned          | 1158                                             | --                                               | 192                                              | 4462                                   |\n| Under  Implementation | 2214                                             | 670                                              | --                                               | 1111                                   |\n| Under Tendering       | 3998                                             | 150                                              | --                                               | 1170                                   |\n| Total                 | 7370                                             | 820                                              | 192                                              | 6743                                   |\n\nTo be in step with ambitious targets, we are attempting all avenues  for  renewable  capacity  addition  to  look  beyond conventional large-scale solar and wind parks. We have signed\n\na Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) to set up a Joint Venture Company for setting up of offshore wind and other Renewable Energy Projects in India and overseas. We have formed another JV  with  National  Investment  and  Infrastructure  Fund  (NIIF) for accelerating our efforts for the acquisition of Renewable Energy assets.\n\nWe are utilizing roofs of power plant buildings for solar power generation and integrating into the existing plant infrastructure. We are also going ahead with floating solar at reservoirs of our projects which is a step towards saving of land and water conservation by reducing water surface evaporation. Till date 9.215 MW of such solar projects have been developed. Besides this, NVVN a subsidiary of the NTPC group is under various stages of implementation of ground mounted/roof-top solar projects along with charging infrastructure development at various airports and public buildings.\n\nWe have associated with International Solar Alliance (ISA) as its corporate partner. By partnering with ISA, we are helping other nations such as Togo, Mali, Malawi, Cuba and Niger through  development  of  around  1.8  GW  solar  projects  as tabulated below.\n\n| Republic of Mali   | 500 MW   |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| Republic of Malawi | 100 MW   |\n| Cuba               | 900 MW   |\n| Republic of Togo   | 285 MW   |\n| Niger              | 50 MW    |\n\nIn coming years, we intend to help develop around 10000 MW Solar portfolio under the aegis of ISA in ISA member countries. We are also working on providing community centred solarisation solutions to 47 SIDS and LDC member countries of ISA. These solutions, which are environment friendly and sustainable, are also helping countries meet various SDG goals. Some worth mentioning solutions being developed are Solar pumps for Irrigation and potable water, solar powered cold storages and Primary Health Centres.\n\nNTPC Solar Trees at Leh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

PNG hydrogen blending (5% vol) pilot (under discussion with Gujarat Gas)\n- a. At Kawas and few CGD networks in Gujarat\n\nNTPC is expecting hydrogen to play a key part in the energy  transition  plan  towards  cleaner  energy.  NTPC has formed a dedicated hydrogen energy group under it's  renewable  energy  vertical  for  taking  up  different projects in the hydrogen domain. NTPC envisions to be the leading supplier of green hydrogen in the country by concentrating on sustainability (only green hydrogen) & cost competitiveness.\n\n## Ash Management\n\nAsh is another resource material which NTPC coal stations produces along with electricity. We are generating revenues through the sale of fly ash and promoting its further utilization through industry partnerships and R&D. NTPC has introduced Ash Policy, which is a vision document dealing with the ash utilization issue in an integral way from generation to end product. This policy aims at maximizing utilization of ash for productive usage along with fulfilling social and environmental obligations, as a green initiative in protecting the nature and giving a better environment to future generations.\n\nDuring  FY  2020-21,  approximately  70.41  million  tonnes  of ash was generated by NTPC Group stations and 79.38 % i.e. 55.89  million  tonnes  of  ash  had  been  gainfully  utilized  in various areas such as issue to industries for cement, concrete, asbestos products, bricks/ blocks making, road embankment construction, ash dyke raising, mine filling, land development works etc.\n\nFly Ash produced at Coal based Thermal Power Plant, is a resource material for Cement industry and building products manufacturing units. It is also being used as one of construction material in Road and Fly over embankment construction and thus helping to save earth and degradation of good agricultural land.",

We continuously strive to reduce our specific consumption of raw materials in line with our philosophy of sustainable production and consumption.\n\nOptimization  of  raw  material  consumption  translates  into value for our shareholders, as well as for our communities. This enables us to also reduce the tariff of electricity making it  affordable  for  all  and  also  reduce  the  burden  on  local resources by minimizing extraction and waste generation.\n\n## Coal Procurement\n\nNTPC has both long term and short term coal supply agreements with domestic companies as well as foreign suppliers. Longterm Coal Supply Agreements (CSAs) are in place with the subsidiary  coal  companies  of  Coal  India  Ltd.  (CIL)  for  an Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of 166.69 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) for the existing thermal stations. In addition, CSA is in place with Singareni Colliery Company Ltd. (SCCL) for Ramagundam for an ACQ of 11.20 MMT.

This is intended to cut down carbon emissions and also to discourage crop residue burning by farmers after harvesting by adding economic value to the crop residue and providing extra income to farmers and employment in rural sector. Biomass co-firing is a unique method to utilize coal based power plant infrastructure to produce renewable energy by simply replacing some of the coal with biomass based fuel. Being carbon neutral fuel, biomass co-firing is a technology recognized by UNFCCC as a measure of reducing greenhouse gas emission.\n\nAfter  successfully  demonstrating  biomass  co-firing  at  Dadri plant, NTPC has started commercial scale biomass co-firing at other NTPC stations also. NTPC has forayed into large scale procurement of biomass for Co-firing by issuing a Long Term (LT) tender for procurement of ~20 MMT biomass for 17 projects of NTPC over the period of four years (i.e. 5 MMTPA).\n\nBesides LT tender, NTPC has awarded contracts for procurement of 4.56 LMT of biomass pellet under short term contracts (9 months). Supply has already started at 7 NTPC stations under short term contracts and also under orders placed for 280 TPD for four years (approx. 4 lakh tonnes) at Dadri plant. NTPC has already fired ~24,600 metric tonnes of biomass pellets at its various plants by March'21 in FY 2020-21 vs 3900 MT used in FY 2019-20.\n\nThe company is using these pellets, made out of stubble and husk, in its almost all coal-fired power plants across the country. The purpose behind usage of agro-based pellets is two fold - one it turns off stubble burning in farms and brings down pollution and two, it reduces coal usage in power production.\n\nBiomass Pellets at NTPC Dadri\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  have  undertaken  EIA  studies based  on  which  Environmental  Management  Plans  for  all stations are prepared and implemented. Our environmental policy focusses on optimum utilization of natural resources, minimization of waste by reduce, reuse & recycle, adoption of latest technologies and augmentation of older units for higher efficiency. We are in a continuous process of environment performance  improvement  with  the  techno-economically feasible engineering solutions to ensure compliance. Accordingly,  we  are  regularly  upgrading  our  technologies and operational practices for maintaining the environmental parameters as per the norms of regulatory agencies. 26 of our stations are ISO:14001 certified. Rest newly commercialized plants are in the process of getting ISO certification. We have also established an environmental grievance mechanism for recording all grievances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNTPC has become signatory of CEO Water Mandate to further its water Stewardship Programmes\n\n## Water & Effluent Management\n\nFor electricity production, water is a prime resource, and we use water in a judicious and sustainable manner. Fresh water is drawn by our stations from various sources of water bodies such as rivers, reservoirs, canals. Sea water is used by our coastal  plants.  The  water  consumption  is  being  monitored continuously through online water metering systems. Water consumption  of  the  stations  is  continually  optimized  by practicing 3R principle (Reduce, Recycle & Reuse), which is the core of our Water Policy.\n\nIn almost all of our Thermal Power Plants, water is used in a closed cycle cooling system with cooling towers, so that there is no pollution of water bodies. In this system, very little loss is incurred through various processes except in the cooling water system where significant amount is lost as evaporation, drift and blow down. We are increasing Cycles of Concentration (COC) to efficiently use water and reduce amount of blow down. The high TDS blow down water is reused in other processes. We are in the process of implementing ZLD (Zero Liquid Discharge) at all of our stations. Till date 16 of our generating stations have implemented ZLD. We are using sea water desalination systems\n\n## Our Water Conservation Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat our costal plants to meet our fresh water requirements. The implementation at rest of stations is in advanced stage and current discharge is in conformity with stipulated norms and conditions. Hence, there is no significant impact on the water bodies and related habitats by the organization's discharges of water (treated effluents) and runoff.\n\nIncreasing reuse and recycling of effluents has also led to a  decrease  in  fresh  water  withdrawal  requirements  over the  years.  However,  increasing  penetration  of  renewables into the grid and reducing power demand in the country is slowly forcing the thermal units to operate at very low PLF, which reduces overall water requirement, but increases per unit water consumption. Further, implementation of wet FGD system at all stations is going to make the water consumption reduction process challenging.\n\n## Water Consumption\n\n| Fresh Water                 | Units   | FY 2019- 20   | FY 2020- 21   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| Fresh water Consumption     | Lakh kL | 8,493.92      | 9,102.20      |\n| Specific Water  Consumption | l/kWh   | 2.93          | 2.90          |\n\n| Sea Water            | Units   |   FY 2020-21 |\n|----------------------|---------|--------------|\n| Sea water Withdrawal | Lakh kL |       881.12 |\n| Sea Water Discharged | Lakh kL |       610.15 |\n| Sea Water Used       | Lakh kL |       270.96 |\n\n| Rain Water Harvested   | Units   |   FY 2020-21 |\n|------------------------|---------|--------------|\n| Surface Storage        | Lakh kL |       101.28 |\n| Ground Water Recharged | Lakh kL |        20.54 |\n\n## Reduce\n\nThrough various water efficiency measures we have been able to reduce our specific water consumption in recent times.\n\nWe are implementing rainwater harvesting systems as part of our dedicated Rainwater Harvesting policy in all our plants to bring down the withdrawal level of fresh water from various\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In case of non- ZLD plants, where treated effluents are discharged into the natural watercourse, are in conformity with the regulatory standards. In FY 2020-21, 117.59 lakh kL of treated water was discharged.\n\n## Waste Management\n\nWe are also committed to environmentally friendly, socially responsible  and  techno-commercially  viable  handling  and disposal of all waste generated in our premises. Our integrated approach  for  waste  management  comprises  of  collection, segregation, transportation, processing, recycling, and disposal of various types of wastes.

There has been emphasis on its further improvement through measurement, monitoring and implementation of conservation plans.\n\nThe basic input materials in power generation are fuel (coal/ gas as primary fuel and oil as secondary fuel) which are as such totally consumed in boiler and hence there is no scope for recyclability of input materials for thermal power generation. Similarly,  the  chemicals  during  water  treatment  are  totally consumed and not recycled.\n\nSeveral  steps  for  improvement  in  cycle  efficiency  have been taken resulting in increase in efficiency and significant improvement in fuel saving (Coal and Oil) per unit of energy generated. As far as coal is concerned, adoption of higher size  units  (higher  steam  parameters)  for  power  generation and  replacement  of  coal  with  Biomass  is  leading  to improvement of design/operational efficiency which in turn is reducing the specific coal consumption. NTPC has already  fired  ~24,600  metric  tonnes  of  biomass  pellets\n\nat its various plants in FY 2020-21 vs 3900 MT used in FY 201920.\n\nThe trends for improvement in performance parameters of specific coal consumption and specific oil consumption are shown in table below:\n\n| Type        | Units    | FY 2019-20   | FY 2020-21   |\n|-------------|----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Coal        | MMT      | 187.53       | 195.39       |\n| Coal        | kCal/kg  | 3,495.00     | 3,487.57     |\n| Natural Gas | MMSCMD   | 5.36         | 7.13         |\n| Natural Gas | kCal/SCM | 9500         | 9,329.26     |\n| Naptha      | MT       | 97.90        | 18,279.54    |\n| Naptha      | kCal/kg  | 11,368.00    | 11,278.11    |\n| LDO         | kL       | 1,10,322.84  | 1,03,297.55  |\n| LDO         | kCal/kL  | 9,521.00     | 9,588.00     |\n| HFO         | kL       | 50,726.27    | 47,561.65    |\n| HFO         | kCal/kL  | 9,891.00     | 9,893.18     |\n| HSD         | kL       | 86.57        | 284.69       |\n| HSD         | kCal/kL  | 9,024.00     | 8,754.50     |\n\nApart from coal, Biomass and water, there are other associated input material, which form a major part of our operations. At NTPC, we take continuous measures for effective and efficient use of our input materials. The snapshot of these input materials for NTPC group has been presented below.\n\nCoal Yard at our Thermal Power Plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of extending the benefits of digitalization, a comprehensive vendor portal has been launched for submission of e invoices and its tracking status.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy & Efficiency Management\n\nFor us, energy conservation is not only intended to reduce our costs, but it is also a part of our sustainable consumption strategy with a view to conserve national energy reserves. In this regard particularly, adoption of higher size units has led to efficiency improvement, leading to a reduction in per unit coal consumption. We  are  supplementing these efforts with cofiring of agro-residues, implementation of Energy and  Efficiency  Management  System,  reduction  in  Auxiliary Power  Consumption  to  further  reduce  our  overall  energy consumption.\n\n## Energy Intensity\n\nThe  Net  Energy  Intensity  of  the  Group,  which  provides  a measure  of  its  operational  efficiency  and  reducing  share of  fossil  based  generation,  amounted  to  10.11  MJ/kWh  in FY 2020-21. The table below shows the trend of total primary\n\nenergy consumption (as listed in above section) and energy intensity at NTPC group level.\n\n| Type                              | Units   | FY 2019-20   | FY 2020-21   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total primary energy  consumption | TJ      | 28,20,455.01 | 29,53,663.88 |\n| Energy Intensity                  | MJ/kWh  | 9.72         | 9.40         |\n| Net Energy Intensity              | MJ/kWh  | 10.52        | 10.11        |\n\nThe decrease in group's Net Energy Intensity reflects the change in the production mix in the year having increase in generation from renewable sources alongwith improvement in energy efficiency. We have been taking a lot of initiatives to conserve energy through various energy and operational efficiency measures. APC of coal plants has decreased as compared to previous years due to efficient operations owing to high power demand in the country.",

It is a market based mechanism to enhance cost effectiveness of improvements in energy efficiency, in energy intensive large industries,  through  certification  of  energy  savings  achieved by  improvement  in  Net  Heat  Rate.  Achieved  improvement in NHR can be traded in terms of Energy Savings Certificates (ESCerts). One ESCerts is equivalent to 1 Mtoe( Metric Tonne Oil Equivalent).\n\nUnder PAT cycle-I, NTPC stations had exceeded Net Heat Rate improvement targets and earned net 170653 EScerts. Currently NTPC has a stock of 161759 EScerts (balance from PAT cycle-I) that will be used for PAT cycle-II. PAT cycle II & III have been completed in March 2019 & 2020 respectively and notification of ESCerts earned is awaited.\n\n## Air (Non-GHG) Emissions Management\n\nWe have made consistent efforts to reduce our air emissions through state-of-the-art technologies and monitoring systems. As per the new notifications of Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and NTPC's Brighter Plan targets for reducing the limits for specific water consumption and stack emissions from thermal power plants for SOx, NOx, PM and mercury emissions, NTPC is leading the power sector in country by implementing the requisite measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  have  installed  Continuous  Emission  Monitoring  System (CEMS) in all running units to monitor emissions of Particulate Matter (PM), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in flue gases. The emissions are monitored on a real-time basis. These results are directly linked with the servers of regulatory agencies namely  CPCB/SPCB.  Additionally,  we  regularly conduct off-line monitoring of our stacks. Ambient air quality monitoring is also monitored through an online Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (AAQMS).\n\nFor controlling PM emissions majority of NTPC stations are equipped with more than 99.8% efficient ESPs. Further, ESP augmentation through Renovation & Modernisation (R&M) has been taken up wherever necessary and work is in progress for 16 units having total cumulative capacity of 5 GW. and we are optimistic to achieve it before the deadline as set in TBP 2032.\n\nFor controlling the SOx emission, NTPC has installed the Lime based wet FGD (Flue Gas Desulphurisation) system in stage-V (500 MW) of Vindhyachal station. Dry sorbent injection (DSI) based FGD has been commissioned and operational for SOx emission control in units (840 MW) of Dadri (Stage-I).\n\nFGD systems are under advance stage of erection at Dadri (Stage-II) and Jhajjar plants. With these, the commissioning of FGD in NTPC Units with a capacity of 58,940 MW is in various stages of progress. Award of FGD in balance NTPC units with a capacity of 2,890 MW is in tendering stage.\n\nFor controlling the NOx, various De-NOx technique are being implemented  at  NTPC  stations  based  on  the  prescribed regulatory  limits  and  our  goals  as  per  Brighter  Plan  2032. Combustion Modification in 15 units of around 7 GW including units located in NCR i.e. 2 units of Dadri, 3 units of Jhajjar have already been completed. Further, award is already placed for Combustion modification for 34 units of around 14GW.\n\nTo meet NOx emission limit of 100 mg/Nm 3 , we are exploring the feasibility of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for units, installed after 01.01.2017. SCR is a proven technology for low ash coal, however it is yet to be proven for abrasive & high ash content Indian coal. In view of this, Pilot tests have been conducted at seven (7) NTPC stations by various SCR system suppliers to assess the suitability of SCR technology for Indian coal. Results of the tests are submitted to Hon'ble Supreme Court. Hon'ble Supreme Court has constituted a committee to review the NOx norm. Based on decision on NOx Norm, plan & strategy for future will be prepared.\n\nWe are monitoring Mercury emissions from our plants. At many stations, mercury emissions are below minimum detectable limit (MDL). In all such cases, for FY 2020-21, 50% of MDL is considered  while  calculating  mercury  load.  We  are  also upgrading our technologies and systems to ensure a reduction in consumption of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).\n\nWe have already phased out the use of PCBs from all our operations.",

We are committed to reduce the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission intensity  of  our  power  generation.  Our  decarbonization strategy is four-pronged.\n\n## Our climate change strategy\n\n## Fuel Diversification\n\nAs on date, NTPC group has 1155 MW, 163 MW and 3757 MW of Solar, Wind and Hydro capacity respectively, total amounting to 5.075 GW. With 2884 MW of renewables and 2255 MW of Hydro in pipeline , the same would reach to 10+ GW in short term. By 2032, NTPC will have 60 GW of renewable capacity. We have decommissioned 1165 MW of thermal capacity till date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technology Upgradation & Efficiency Improvement\n\nWe have adopted comparatively cleaner and energy-efficient technologies that reduce GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated. We are continuously moving from sub-critical to supercritical and onto ultra-supercritical technology. NTPC is among early adopters of supercritical and ultrasupercritical boilers in India, which save ~2% of fuel per unit of power generated  resulting  in  8%  reduction  of  emission  intensity with respect to conventional subcritical power plants. It also increase efficiency by around 8%. As on 31.03.2021, NTPC had already commissioned 23 units based on super critical technology with a total capacity of 16,300 MW. Also, 8 units with  a  capacity  of  5,420  MW  were  under  commissioning. Further, as on 31.03.2021, NTPC had already commissioned two units based on ultra super critical technology with capacity of 1,320 MW while 7 units with a capacity of 5,320 MW were under commissioning.\n\nAlso, as mentioned in the earlier section, we did energy saving of around 1643.3 TJ in the reporting year. In the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme of GoI, NTPC has exceeded the targets and have earned 170653 ESCerts.\n\n## Research & Development\n\nCO 2 is the largest gaseous pollutant in several major industry viz fossil fuel power plants, cement, sugar, textile etc. We are working on to capture CO 2 from waste flue gases & convert it to hydrocarbon viz Methanol. This will ensure that we generate a clean fuel as well sequester carbon from the environment further adding great economic value. We are working on the following two projects:\n\n- a)   Project-1: Design & Setup of 10 TPD CO 2 to Methanol Plant at NTPC Vindhyachal.",

Our goal of building the economy could only be achieved by respecting the ecology. Thus, we put in our most sincere efforts to try to give back to nature more than we take. Envisioning a clear and comprehensive goal to preserve our nature, we have developed a dedicated NTPC Biodiversity Policy in 2018 which clearly states our vision and guidelines for conservation, restoration and enhancement of biodiversity. Also, NTPC is a proud member of Indian Business and Biodiversity initiative.\n\nNTPC  does  not  construct  and  maintain  transmission  and distribution corridors. For power project areas, these aspects are  covered  in  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Studies, undertaken according to Terms of Reference prescribed by MOEF&CC. If any specifically important ecosystem exists within the study area, additional studies are undertaken and their recommendations are adopted.\n\nIn case of involvement of forest land, statutory permission for diversion of forest land for non-forest activities is obtained from MOEF&CC in accordance with Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; which includes enhancement of forests with the amounts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndeposited for Compensatory Afforestation and Net Present Value of forest land involved.\n\nSimilarly,  in  case  of  involvement  of  coastal  marine  areas, clearance  under  Coastal  Regulation  Zone  Notification  is obtained and the provisions therein are implemented.\n\nWe  also  have  a  flagship  Biodiversity  programme  towards conservation  of  Olive  Ridley  Turtles.  The  coast  of  Andhra Pradesh is known for the nesting and foraging of Olive Ridley Turtles - which is a Vulnerable Category species on IUCN's Redlist. Thus efforts are underway by the Andhra Pradesh",

We are now a proud partner in the efforts of the forest department to conserve the habitat of Olive Ridley Turtles by way of a five-year agreement between our Simhadri Station and the forest department for conservation efforts in 9 coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh covering 732 km of coastal area. Under this initiative, we have spent ' 4.6 Cr. in a phased manner till date. As a result our efforts, resulted in increasing trend in the hatchlings released in the sea-water.\n\nWe understand the importance of our operations for the society and nation's economy, but we are also cognizant enough to ensure that none of our station location and operation have a significant and irreversible negative impact on protected areas and wildlife sanctuaries.\n\nNone of the project sites for thermal power plants established by  NTPC  were  located  within  10  km.  or  respective  ecosensitive zones of the protected areas or the areas of high biodiversity outside the protected areas.

Also, A special scientific study has confirmed that the impact of treated effluents from Kahalgaon STPP, soon to be declared ZLD, on the sanctuary are insignificant.\n- \u00b7 In case of Feroz Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Station, Samaspur  Bird  Sanctuary  was  established  by  State Government in 1987 much after the project construction was started by UP State Electricity Board in 1981. NTPC took over the project in 1992.\n\nOur vision of having a healthy ecology around begins from inside of our plants. Not only do we put in our best efforts to  avoid  disturbance  to  ecology  of  the  surrounding  area by  minimizing  discharge/disposal  of  waste/effluents,  but we also give a special thrust to afforestation and green belt development at all our projects covering vast tracts of land in and around projects. At some of the projects (like Rihand and National Capital Power Project), we have converted barren stretches of land into lush green environments.\n\n## Habitats protected or restored\n\n## Asian Waterbird at Dadri\n\nNTPC with help of UNDP India has conducted the first ever Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) at the NTPC Dadri complex in collaboration with Wetlands International South Asia (WISA) and Global Tiger Forum (GTF) on 15-16 January 2021. A total of 45 species were recorded from the NTPC Dadri wetlands\n\nAsian Waterbird at Dadri\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(including Wetland 1 and Wetland 2). Out of these, 42 species are  classified  as  'wetland  dependent'  as  per  the  Asian Waterbird Census data sheets.\n\nThe results of the Census/Assessment point out to the presence of  many  species,  that  too  in  good  numbers.  The  wetland complex at NTPC Dadri was indeed a stopover site for migratory avifauna, where they gather in relatively large numbers to feed on their way to other larger wetlands throughout the Indian subcontinent. The wetland represents a high species richness when compared with the total area/size of the waterbodies and therefore is also of high conservation significance.\n\n## Cheer Pheasant at Koldam\n\nAt our Koldam Hyroelectric Power Plant (HEPP), where habitat of  Cheer  Pheasant  (Catreus  wallichii),  which  is  included  in IUCN Red List species (under vulnerable category) existed in some area of Majathal Wild Life Sanctuary, which falls under submergence area of Koldam HEPP. In order to restore the area of Majthal Wildlife Sanctuary involved in Koldam Project, NTPC has identified jointly with wildlife Wing of GoHP 500 ha of land in and around Majthal Wildlife Sanctuary for Cheer Pheasant habitat, acquired the land and handed over to State Government to get it notified as a sanctuary. In addition, another 10 km 2 wildlife habitat has been identified in consultation with State Forest Department of HP to get it notified as a Sanctuary. Various  schemes  such  as  compensatory  afforestation,  CAT plan, RIM plantation, development of fisheries etc. towards environmental and bio-diversity conservation are already being implemented through the concerned authorities. We have also made financial contributions towards various schemes being implemented  by  the  state  government  at  Koldam  HEPP  to restore/ enhance the wildlife habitats.\n\nFurther, we have taken various voluntary initiatives towards conservation  of  aquatic  and  terrestrial  wildlife  around our operations. Our Simhadri Station in Andhra Pradesh is supporting  the  Central  Marine  Fisheries  Research  Institute (CMFRI) to deploy artificial reefs near the coast. These reefs simulate coral beds, and function as a comfortable habitat\n\nCheer Pheasant at Koldam\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first deployment of artificial reefs in Andhra Pradesh was successfully done off the Muthalampalem coast.\n\n## Biodiversity of Offset Habitats\n\nAs  none  of  the  thermal  project  sites  established  by  NTPC are located within protected areas, no offset habitats were created and the comparison is not applicable. In case of hydro power project at Koldam, offset habitat has been created with the help of State Forest Department. The comparative study is yet to be undertaken.\n\n## Badarpur Biodiversity Park\n\nWe have taken up the development of Mega Eco Park at Badarpur spread over 884 acres, one of the largest man-made parks in not only India but will be bigger than New York Central Park spread over 842 acres. Eco Park is being developed over already closed Badarpur station's Ash dyke.\n\n## Narmada Landscape Restoration Project\n\nNTPC  in  collaboration  with  US-AID  is  supporting  a  unique Biodiversity  Project  titled  'Narmada  Landscape  Restoration Project'  along  River  Narmada  between  Maheshwar  and Omkareshwar dams. With an investment of about Rs 25 Cr.s, this project will be benefitting the local population, Indore City,and Madhya Pradesh at large as the project is aimed to enhance  green  cover,  improve  water  retention,  the  crop diversity including to promote organic farming and marketing. The project is being taken up involving Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) Headquartered at Seoul and Indian Institute of Forest Management Bhopal. This project is also one of its kind in India and implementation is likely to become a role model for replication across the country\n\n## Afforestation\n\nNTPC  since  its  inception  has  been  carrying  out  massive plantation to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. NTPC's afforestation efforts not only add to India's green cover and oxygen bank but also perform the role of 'sinks' for the polluting emissions from the stations etc.\n\nNTPC  has  developed  nurseries  in  plants  and  townships  to develop seed and seedlings, plants for in-house plantation and  horticulture  activities.  Plantation  activities  in  NTPC  is done through State Forest Departments through MOUs. The MOUs specify the plantation year, maintenance years of the plantation, fund flow details and survival percentages of the plantation. NTPC has made Guidelines of Afforestation based on which the afforestation is done in NTPC projects.\n\nThe plantation activities undertaken by NTPC can be classified into five broad categories.\n\n- 1. Development of green belt around the plant: The green belt helps in reducing pollution by trapping particulate due to plant operations, reduce the noise level originating from running machines in the plant, acts as a carbon sink thereby reducing the temperature in the surrounding and improves the oxygen content of the atmosphere.

Plantation  by  individual  stations:  In  order  to  create additional carbon sinks in line with India's NDC-2030, NTPC has decided to plant 10 million trees from 2016 to 2026 with 1 million trees per year across India through different NTPC stations. Till date NTPC has done the plantation of more than 36 million since inception.\n- 3. Distribution of fruit bearing trees to farmers and township residents by NTPC projects:\n- 4. NTPC distributes small saplings of fruit bearing trees, flower trees and vegetable bearing plants to the local farmers and township residents. The aim is to encourage plantation by township residents and farmers in their individual land holdings. These trees are supplied free of cost to the farmers and the residents.\n- 5. NTPC also encourages plantation of trees by its employees and  their  dependants  during  several  occasions  like World Environment day, birthday, marriage anniversary, superannuation day, etc.\n\n## Environment Training\n\nWe  regularly conduct  capacity building programs on Environment for our various stakeholders including employees, contract workforce, communities etc . The topic includes Waste management,  water  conservation,  biodiversity  protection etc. Total no. of trainings conducted in FY 2020-21 has been tabulated below:\n\n| Indicator           | Units   | FY 2020-21   |\n|---------------------|---------|--------------|\n| Employees           | Nos     | 3,053        |\n| Contractual Workers | Nos     | 3,912        |\n| Family of Employees | Nos     | 3,075        |\n\nAll NTPC stations have environmental cells and 26 NTPC stations are certified for ISO: 14001. The Environment Management Systems are regularly inspected/ audited internally as well as externally by Regulatory agencies such as SPCBs & CPCB, NGO and ISO certification agencies.\n\nOur group companies NEEPCO & THDC undertook expenditure worth more than ' 60 lacs in FY 2020-21 for various Biodiversity initiatives.\n\nContact  details  of  the  persons  for  lodging  grievance  are displayed at the main entrance of the plant. The grievances are also maintained in the grievance book. Total 08 nos. grievances were received in reporting year. No significant fines and nonmonetary sanctions were imposed during the FY 2020-21'.\n\nNTPC is legally bound to comply the environmental laws and regulations formulated by the statutory agencies. Hence, the company is in a continuous process of 100% compliance with the  techno-economically  feasible  engineering  solutions  to ensure compliances of any directives issued by regulators in a time bound manner.\n\nDue  to  stringent  environment  norms,  day-by-day  company requires renovation & modernization (R&M) of pollution control technologies /devices of our old running units. Accordingly, NTPC is able to comply all the directives of legal authorities with the R&M activities.",

Both proactive and reactive processes are deployed in safety risk management. Proactive processes are put into practice for hazard identification and safety risk management. Reactive  Process  for  hazard  identification  and  safety  risk management  includes  both  formal  and  informal  incident investigation results and using Incident Recall. The interlinked Safety Risk Management comprising of hazard identification, risks  assessments,  incidents  analysis  and  incident  recall  is depicted below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance to our safety principals, we have developed a comprehensive and centralized Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control (HIRAC) document for our Coal, Gas, and  Hydro  stations.  Station-specific  HIRAC  documents  are prepared to identify site-specific risks and control procedures. Strategy for safety implementation is made in the form of Operation  Guidance  Notes  (OGNs),  Local  Management Instructions  (LMIs),  Job  Safety  Analysis  (JSAs)  and  Disaster Management Plan (DMP).\n\nAn  effort  has  been  made  to  identify  postulated  hazards associated with the activities related to the power generation. To make a comprehensive hazard identification, input was taken from historical accident and incident data from different (Coal, gas and Hydro) stations. To enrich this exercise further data of other power utilities were also referred. The hierarchy of controls of hazards followed in preparing this document is elimination of hazard, substitution of hazard, engineering controls, administrative controls and PPEs in respective order. This document serves as overall input to the stations while preparing station specific HIRAC document. Also this is useful for capacity building of line executive or new entrants.\n\n## Incident Investigation\n\nOur aim is to reach the target of zero injuries and incidents across all our operating stations. We have a formal process for investigation of all accidents to examine each case in details and depth to find out the causes of accidents, the extent of\n\nlosses caused, the circumstances/individuals responsible and to  obtain  considered  recommendations  for  prevention  of recurrences in similar or related nature of accidents. Incident investigation is done as per 'Guidelines for Constitution of Enquiry Committees & Conduct of Enquiries' as per NTPC Safety Manual 2015.\n\n## NTPC Safety Framework\n\nNTPC  is  implementing  NTPC  safety  framework  system  as per its safety policy. This Framework is purposed to be the guidance  document  to  the  various  functions  and  roles.  It contains a set of expectations  that ensure that all efforts are aligned with the overall policy and objectives of NTPC. The expectations are expressed broadly in the form of components -  Safety  Policy,  Safety  Risk  Management,  Safety  Assurance and Safety Promotion. This Framework also covers functional implementation expectations:\n\n- \u00b7 What the different functions & roles must do to implement a robust system and provides essential guidance?\n- \u00b7 How it will be accomplished?\n\nTo facilitate such guidance, where required, components are divided into smaller elements and processes.\n\n## COMPONENT 1.

The percentage of employees undergoing such trainings is 100% (approx.) in the reporting year. Recently corporate safety has developed standard  safety  induction  training  module  for  uniform implementation across NTPC. Safety induction training is must before issuing gate pass for plant entry. 16 Job specific training modules have been identified and being developed. Corporate safety  is  developing  trainers  on  these  modules  from  each project, so that further job specific training can be arranged at projects with a uniformity across NTPC. Safety pep-talk and tool box talks are provided to workers before start of the job by supervisor/engineer so that workers are made aware about the hazards involved in the job and preventions.\n\n## Workers Related Injuries\n\nAll work related injuries are reported as per the established system of accident reporting in the NTPC Safety manual. All incidents  resulting  into  injury  are  investigated  as  per  the established procedure in NTPC Safety manual. The gist of fatal accidents and reportable accidents are uploaded at  Safety intranet. Details of the accident after investigation is shared through meetings (virtually/ physically)  with all projects so that cause and recommendations can be communicated for timely action.\n\nAll work related injuries are also shared with senior persons in  each  project  through  mobile  application  for  immediate corrective action if required. Our Safety MIS includes monitoring of following indicators:\n\n| Lead Indicators      | Lag Indicators   |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| Deviations           | Fatal            |\n| SOV+CFTV+ZLSV        | Fire Incidents   |\n| Near Miss            | First-Aid        |\n| Training             | Non-Reportable   |\n| Pep Talk             | Reportable       |\n| Reward & Recognition |                  |\n\n## NTPC Safety App: Suraksha\n\nCorporate safety in association with Corporate IT has launched mobile app 'Suraksha' which has a facility of reporting of work related injuries and incidents. Data of the app is fetched in SAP in real time basis. Capturing of latest data helps analysis of work related injuries and in taking corrective action to prevent their recurrence in NTPC. Till date more than 10000 employees have downloaded this app and using it for safety reporting and references.",

To minimize the risks, regular monitoring of the workplace for hazards like dust/coal dust, gas or vapor, illumination, noise- level is carried out and trend analysis is done.  We also regularly  hold  awareness  sessions  for  our  employees  and contract workers on industrial hazards, occupational diseases, lifestyle modifications etc.\n\n## Workers Related ill Health\n\nNo incident of work-related ill health or occupational disease case were recorded during the reporting year. Further, no legal cases or potential risks related to health and safety including diseases and judgments affecting members of the public were recorded.\n\nWork place monitoring for work related ill health hazards like Dust/Coal dust , Gas or vapour, noise level etc. is done and record is maintained. Actions to mitigate these hazards are taken accordingly.\n\n## Emergencies Management\n\nIn line with our long-term goals, we have established effective engineering controls at all our stations to indicate and monitor emergency situations at our sites. Detailed emergency plans have been developed at all stations as per statutory provisions.\n\nResponsibilities  are  assigned  to  all  concerned  to  handle emergency situations.

Since activities representing Lead indicators are proactive in nature, NTPC gives due importance in promoting such activities. They help in identifying potential hazard in terms of unsafe condition, unsafe act and further eliminating them. This gives the right input and direction to us in improving safety culture towards progressing to incident free work place.\n\n|                  | No. of Persons   | No. of Persons   |              |              | Reportable Incidents*   | Reportable Incidents*   | Reportable Incidents*   | Reportable Incidents*   | Total Man Days   | Total Man Days   |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                  | employed         | employed         | Man hours    | Man hours    | Fatal                   | Fatal                   | Non-Fatal               | Non-Fatal               | Lost             | Lost             |\n| Type             | FY 2019-         | FY 2020- 21      |              |              |                         | FY                      | FY                      | FY  2020-               | FY 2019- 20      | FY  2020-        |\n|                  | 20               |                  | FY 2019-20   | FY 2020-21   | FY  2019-20             | 2020- 21                | 2019- 20                | 21                      |                  | 21               |\n| NTPC Employees   | 16,450           | 18,255           | 4,10,59,200  | 4,53,07,908  | 1                       | 1                       | 0                       | 4                       | 6,000            | 6,120            |\n| Contract Workers | 90,847           | 97,442           | 22,67,54,112 | 24,28,15,807 | 17                      | 6                       | 63                      | 20                      | 1,03,421         | 37,335           |\n| Total            | 1,07,297         | 1,15,697         | 26,78,13,312 | 28,81,23,715 | 18                      | 7                       | 63                      | 24                      | 1,09,421         | 43,455           |\n\n*Excludes under construction projects\n\n| Type             | Freqency Rate (FR)*   | Freqency Rate (FR)*   | Incident Rate (IR)   | Incident Rate (IR)   | Injury Rate*   | Injury Rate*   |\n|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                  | FY 2019-20            | FY 2020-21            | FY 2019-20           | FY 2020-21           | FY 2019-20     | FY 2020-21     |\n| NTPC Employees   | 0.024                 | 0.110                 | 0.061                | 0.274                | 0.005          | 0.022          |\n| Contract Workers | 0.353                 | 0.107                 | 0.881                | 0.267                | 0.071          | 0.021          |\n| Total            | 0.302                 | 0.108                 | 0.755                | 0.268                | 0.060          | 0.022          |\n\n*Rates calculated on 1,000,000 hours worked\n\n| Type                             | No. of Deviations   | No. of Deviations   | No. of Near Misses   | No. of Near Misses   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                  | FY 2019-20          | FY 2020-21          | FY 2019-20           | FY 2020-21           |\n| NTPC Employees + contact workers | 1,02,835            | 90,303              | 731                  | 1,397                |\n\n| Type             | No. of High Consequences Injuries*   | No. of High Consequences Injuries*   | Rate of High Consequences Injuries   | Rate of High Consequences Injuries   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                  | FY 2019-20                           | FY 2020-21                           | FY 2019-20                           | FY 2020-21                           |\n| NTPC Employees   | 0                                    | 0                                    | 0                                    | 0                                    |\n| Contract Workers | 0                                    | 0                                    | 0                                    | 0                                    |\n\n*excluding fatalities\n\nNTPC employees performing mock drill with NDRF Team (2/2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We value our relationship with the customers and recognize Customer Focus as one of our core values. We have\n\nan elaborate system of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), through which we reach out to our customers to collect their valuable feedback/experiences/expectations using regular structured interactions including support services and trainings. Our commercial department through the two tier structure is the interfacing department with our customers.\n\nWe have also put in place a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) survey system, to gather customer's feedback through a survey and respond to their requirements. As per the CSI survey conducted in FY 2020-21, 97% of our customers were satisfied and  there  were  no  such  complaints  from  the  customers. However, as part of the tariff determination process under the overall Regulatory System, different cases have been filed by  NTPC  against  CERC/Customers  or  filed  at  the  Appellate Tribunal/ Courts by different beneficiaries against NTPC/CERC.

So there is no issue relating to privacy of data. Moreover,  the  energy  bills  are  generated  through  ERP-SAP software by NTPC and delivered to the authorized person of Discom as per the Power Purchase PPA.\n\nNo complaints have been received concerning breaches of customer privacy, neither have any leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data been identified during FY 2020-21.\n\n## Health and safety impacts of our product\n\nAs a responsible power producer, we offer technical and managerial support services to our clients to the best of our capabilities,  as  required,  even  though  we  are  not  directly involved in the businesses of transmission and distribution. We offer various customer support activities in different areas, including health and safety aspects to the customers in the form of workshops and seminars.\n\nWe take due care in displaying safety instructions in the local languages. Electricity, our sole product cannot be labelled due to its intrinsic nature. However, NTPC has been complying with the Grid Code and Grid standard - national and international wherever applicable.\n\nNo incidence of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our product and services during their lifecycles was reported.\n\nOur marketing strategy is largely managed by our commercial function for power generation business and  by consultancy and  Business  Development  wing  for  other  avenues.  The Commercial  department  analyses  the  demand  and  supply situation in the region and markets the power from the new proposed projects.\n\nWe approach all state power distribution utilities of the region, for getting requisition of power from the new proposed station, based on which viability of the project is studied further. Based on  the  consent  received,  Power  Purchase  Agreements  are signed with the state power utilities. Allocation of power from the new generating station to the respective willing customers (state utilities) is done by the Ministry of Power, Government of India.\n\nWitnessing the rising demand for clean and sustainable energy, we have been investing and redirecting our strategy to provide renewable energy to interested customers. We are significantly reducing the dependency on coal and gas through renewable power infusion.\n\nHowever,  due  to  the  recent  thrust  on  renewable  energy generation in the country, there is a probability of a reduction in scheduled generation from coal/gas plants due to renewable power infusion as a result of addition of renewable capacity, Renewable  Power  obligation  and  subdued  demand  of electricity. Our commercial function makes the un-requisitioned surplus  power  thereof  available  to  interested  consumers through  Power  Exchange  or  bilateral  agreement.  We  have created an online portal with direct connectivity to customers/ beneficiaries and RLDC for ease of transactions.\n\nDuring FY 2020-21, no non-compliance concerning marketing communications was reported.",

The  platform  provides  better control and compliance with various policies and guidelines. Currently, there are 9 shared service centres catering to the procurements of over 30 of our sites. SSC has resulted in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbenefits of economies of scales, more favourable conditions, and long-term commitments.\n\nAs a result of the SSC, we are able to screen all our vendors on a continuous basis for any negative impacts on the environment, society or any potential human rights violations. Assessments are carried out through physical inspections as well. Only those suppliers that clear our screening process are pursued for any procurement opportunity. We maintain a policy of not engaging with/terminating business relationships with the suppliers who are unable to clear our screening process.\n\nHuman Rights provisions are built in our bidding documents for supply cum erection and civil packages invited on competitive bidding  basis  covering  our  suppliers  and  contractors.    All our supply chain partners are committed to ensure that no instances of child labour or any form of forced or compulsory labour take place at any of our vendors' site locations. We have a defined set of policies and frameworks to ensure that no human rights of indigenous local communities are violated throughout our supply chain.\n\nWe  practice  a  fair,  equitable  and  transparent  tendering procedure. We are also actively soliciting feedback from our vendors  to  continuously  improve  our  vendor  management systems for improved vendor relationships.\n\nFollowing actions have been taken to adjust payment policies and procedures\n\n- 1. NTPC  has  launched  vendor  payment  portal  for  all  the suppliers/contractors for bill tracking for the supply of goods and services rendered.\n- 2. NTPC has now on-boarded all the three TReDS platforms approved by Reserve Bank of India. TReDS aims to provide liquidity to the MSME seller by the financiers present on the TReDS platform at very attractive interest rates, without a recourse, much before the due date of payment.\n- 3. In line with Government of India's Digital India initiative, guidelines have been issued regarding implementation of 100 % digital invoice submission in NTPC\n\n## Indigenous focus\n\nTo  encourage  Indian  bidders  and  suppliers,  provisions regarding price preference and deemed export benefits are stipulated in the bidding documents as per the extant policy of Government of India. Our procurement process promotes indigenous goods, by giving preference based on domestic content in the procured goods * . We have been consistently able to maintain the value of our indigenous purchase at more than 96 % of the total purchase FY18 onwards.\n\nNTPC  is  giving  purchase  preference  to  local  suppliers  / procurement from local suppliers in line with provisions of 'Public  Procurement  (Preference  to  Make  in  India),  Order 2017' (PPP-MII Order) dated 15.06.2017 and its subsequent revisions  issued  by  Department  of  Industrial  Policy  and Promotion (DIPP).",

There were no legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly practices in the reporting year.\n\n## Public Policy\n\nWe do not support, in cash or in-kind, any political party or their members and related institutions.\n\n## Our Communities\n\nAt NTPC, our operations also extend in the direction of creating societal value. Our spirit of caring and sharing is embedded in our vision and mission statement. As an organisation, NTPC owes its success to the people of India and strives to work for their sustainable development.\n\nOur core organizational belief of changing lives and adding value  to  our  communities  is  manifested  through  constant engagements  with  our  communities  across  our  geographic locations.  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  has  been synonymous  with  our  core  business.  Our  Resettlement  & Rehabilitation  (R&R)  policy  covers  community  development (CD) activities - which are initiated as soon as a project is conceived and thereafter, extensive community / peripheral development activities are taken up along with the project development.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n\nOur policy for CSR is in line with Companies Act 2013 and DPE Guidelines for CSR. It covers a wide range of activities including implementation of key programmes through NTPC Foundation.\n\nCSR  programs  undertaken  by  Company  include  activities specified in Schedule VII of the Companies Act 2013 & rules made there under and any other activity for benefit of community at large. Focus areas of NTPC's CSR activities are Health, Sanitation, Safe Drinking Water and Education. However, company also takes up activities in the areas of Capacity Building of the youth, Women Empowerment, Social Infrastructure livelihood creation and support through innovative agriculture & livestock development, support to Physically Challenged Person (PCPs), and activities contributing towards Environment Sustainability.\n\nPreference  for  CSR  activities  is  being  given  to  local  areas around  Company's  operations,  ensuring  that  majority  CSR funds  are  spent  for  activities  in  local  areas.  However, considering Inclusive Growth & Environment Sustainability and to supplement Government effort, activities are also taken up anywhere in the country. During the year, our CSR initiatives were spread in 19 states Pan-India. Also, about 450 villages and more than 400 schools have been benefitted by NTPC's various CSR initiatives at different locations. NTPC's CSR initiatives have touched, in one way or the other, the lives of around 14 lakhs people, residing at remote locations.\n\nWe  design  and  shortlist  our  CSR  portfolio  based  on  a participative,  bottom-up  and  consultative  process  which includes consultations with various stakeholders - including\n\nPanchayat  officials, District Administration, civil society, community  members  -  including  women  representatives and representatives of backward  communities, public representatives  (elected/  nominated),  Village  Development Advisory  Committee  (VDAC)  etc.  We  also  conduct  Need Assessment Surveys (NAS) every five years through reputed external agencies in consultation with local communities and institutions  to  design  customized  community  development solutions through our CSR activities.\n\nThe effectiveness of CSR & Sustainable Development programme is assessed through both internal & external evaluations. NTPC conducts  a  third-party  Social  Impact  assessment  at  every two-year for all its major CSR activities at various operating stations. During the Year 2020-21, NTPC has taken up Impact Evaluation at 05 stations.  These studies which take Human Development Indicators as reference for measuring the impact have statistically demonstrated that the CSR interventions of the company are improving the lives of people. We have also established a formal local community grievance process.\n\nWe have a board level Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee -to oversee the CSR activities. In FY 2020-21, we exceeded our minimal prescribed expenditure on CSR works and spent around ' 418.87 Cr. towards CSR initiatives on standalone basis. For group CSR activities amount spent was ' 461.96 Cr. Of the total CSR expenditure in FY 2020-21, over 84% was spent towards education and skill development; hunger & poverty, healthcare and sanitation.\n\nThis was in line with the priorities defined by the government. For detailed break-up of CSR Expenditure in various Thematic Areas please refer to below chart.\n\n## Expenditure in Thematic Areas of our CSR\n\nOne of our most prominent initiative is our Flagship Program Girl Empowerment Mission (GEM) targeted for the empowerment of the girl child wherein interventions were taken to make the girls self-reliant and confident in all walks of life.

As  a  part  of  our  decision-making  process,  we  have developed an R&R policy. Our Resettlement & Rehabilitation (R&R) policy covers community development (CD) activitieswhich are initiated as soon as a project is conceived. The CD activities are also initiated under ICD (Initial Community Development)  Policy.  We  are  sensitive  towards  the  needs and aspirations of the Project affected Persons (PAPs) and have  always  tried  for  the  best  possible  R&R  package.  We have established Public Information Centres/ R&R Offices to disseminate useful information sought by the villagers. Other useful  information  is  also  communicated  through  notices, pamphlets, letters etc. In last 7 years upto FY 2020-21, ' 1782 Cr. worth of expenditure were incurred towards Community Development (CD) work for R&R. Land compensation and R&R grants disbursement were in active mode mainly in Darlipali, Lara, Tanda-II, North Karanpura Thermal Power Projects and Pakri-Barwadih, Kerandari, Dulanga and Talaipalli Coal mining projects in FY 2020-21.\n\n## Salient Features of our R&R efforts\n\n## Minimize R&R issues\n\nMinimize  R&R  issues  proactively  at  the  time  of  projects exploration itself & other adequate relocation. Redesigning layout  to  avoid  acquisition  of  homesteads  to  the  extent possible as also minimizing the acquisition of agricultural land, optimization of plant layout and reduction in land requirement, etc. However, in case the physical displacement is absolutely necessary, we remain committed to their adequate relocation and  minimization  of  the  transition  period  &  consequent impacts.\n\n## Grievance Redressal System\n\nWe have a Grievance Redressal System for grievance of PAPs at our projects. We have also set up dedicated R&R groups which operate at Projects, Regional Headquarters and the Corporate Centre. Further grievances are also received through RTI which are answered in time-bound manner. As a result of our efforts, no significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities  were  identified/  reported,  and  no  grievances about  impacts  on  society  were  filed  during  the  reporting period. Further no incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nFor more details on R&R system, polices and frameworks, NTPC website can be accessed.",

The lockdown was imposed in Mar'20 and movement of work force, consumables and spares became highly restricted. Electricity being the essential item - NTPC had onus of 24x7 generation in a seamless way. While our operation and maintenance staff were able to attend the plants in normal way as most of NTPC plants are located in remote areas but supporting them with fuel, spares and timely coordination became a challenge. Fortunately, NTPC had implemented a number of digital initiatives to work in digital mode. Some of the remaining steps were completed on war footing to allow employees and vendors to work in 100% online mode. The employees in service departments were enabled to work from home. All the meetings were carried out in virtual mode.\n\nNTPC Ltd managed to carry out its normal business activities during  the  COVID-19  imposed  lock  down  with  the  help of  digital  intervention  in  all  areas.  The  entire  purchase requisition to payment processes have been digitalized with no paper movement in between. All internal approvals are made through e-office. With the help of these digitalization initiatives, NTPC could move to Shared Service Model for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nall our procurements. NTPC is now moving towards Unified Shared Service model .IT and automation is the basic pillar on which this is based upon.\n\nVendors have been on-boarded on our PRADIP (PRoActive Digital Initiative for Paperless office) portal to submit their digital invoice and then to track it till payment is made. Also details of payment / deduction is shared automatically on vendor's registered email, thus increasing transparency and accountability. To further help Vendors, a Chatbot (NISHA ) has been implemented within the Portal. Procurements are done through GEPNIC and GEM portals and these are integrated with our ERP system for data flow in either direction. To help our other  customers  such as ash  & scraps buyers who use our machinery on rent basis etc, a payment portal is available so that they can make payments due digitally. Further sundry payments for accommodation, hospital charges etc can also be made by vendors through mobile apps such as PayTM. To help MSME vendors to avail advance payment from banks against delivery of items, NTPC has integrated RXIL, Invoice mart with our ERP system. A separate portal along with mobile app was launched to help customers get information about ash availability and other related details in power plants and to book their consignments accordingly.",

Significant accounting policies\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nThe Company has elected to utilize the option under Ind AS 101-'First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards' by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16-'Property, plant and equipment'& Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets' retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 1 April 2015. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1 April 2015, i.e. the Company's date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on transition to Ind AS.\n\n## 1.  Property, plant and equipment\n\n## 1.1. Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties and non-refundable purchase  taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the present value of initial estimate of cost of dismantling, removal and restoration.\n\nSubsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.\n\nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.\n\nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, capitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.\n\nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering estimates/ assessments.\n\nItems of spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.\n\nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for the Company to obtain future economic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 1.2. Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nExpenditure on major inspection and overhauls of generating unit is capitalized, when it meets the asset recognition criteria. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection and overhaul is derecognized.\n\nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the\n\n<!-- image -->",

The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n\n## 1.3. Decommissioning costs\n\nThe present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\n\n## 1.4. De-recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of  property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn circumstance, where an item of property, plant and equipment is abandoned, the net carrying cost relating to the property, plant and equipment is written off in the same period.\n\n## 1.5. Depreciation/amortization\n\nDepreciation is recognized in statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company, covered under Part B of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight-line method following the rates and methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the, oil & gas exploration and consultancy business is charged on straight-line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.\n\nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:\n\n| a)  Kutcha roads                                                                                                                                                      | 2 years   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| b)  Enabling works                                                                                                                                                    |           |\n| -  residential buildings                                                                                                                                              | 15 years  |\n| -  internal electrification of residential buildings                                                                                                                  | 10 years  |\n| -   non-residential buildings including their internal electrification, water supply, sewerage  & drainage works, railway sidings, aerodromes, helipads and airstrips | 5 years   |\n| c)  Personal computers & laptops including peripherals                                                                                                                | 3 years   |\n| d)  Photocopiers, fax machines, water coolers and refrigerators                                                                                                       | 5 years   |\n| e)  Temporary erections including wooden structures                                                                                                                   | 1 year    |\n| f)  Telephone exchange                                                                                                                                                | 15 years  |\n| video conferencing systems and other communication equipment h) Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings                                                      | 2-7 years |\n| i)  Solar/wind power plants which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations                                                                                         | 25 years  |\n\nMajor overhaul and inspection costs which have been capitalized are depreciated over the period until the next scheduled outage or actual major inspection/overhaul, whichever is earlier.\n\nCapital spares are depreciated considering the useful life ranging between 2 to 40 years based on technical assessment.\n\nRight-of-use land and buildings relating to generation of electricity business governed by CERC Tariff Regulations are fully amortized over the  lease period or life of the related plant whichever is lower following the rates and methodology notified by the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

C.19 in respect of depreciation/amortization of right-of-use assets.\n\n## 2.  Capital work-in-progress\n\nCost incurred for property, plant and equipment that are not ready for their intended use as on the reporting date, is classified under capital work- in-progress.\n\nThe cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials & direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying asset.\n\nExpenses directly attributable to construction of property, plant and equipment incurred till they are ready for their intended use are identified and allocated on a systematic basis on the cost of related assets.\n\nDeposit works/cost plus contracts are accounted for on the basis of statements of account received from the contractors.\n\nUnsettled liabilities for price variation/exchange rate variation in case of contracts are accounted for on estimated basis as per terms of the contracts.\n\n## 3.  Intangible assets and intangible assets under development\n\n## 3.1. Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn intangible asset is recognized if and only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Company, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties, non -refundable taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates and any directly attributable expenses of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Company intends to & has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.\n\nExpenditure incurred which are eligible for capitalizations under intangible assets are carried as intangible assets under development till they are ready for their intended use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

De-recognition\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de-recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 3.4. Amortization\n\nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight-line method over a period of legal right to use or 3 years, whichever is less. Other intangible assets are amortized on straight-line method over the period of legal right to use or life of the related plant, whichever is less.\n\nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.\n\n## 4.  Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nExpense/income recognized in the statement of profit and loss to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized as 'Regulatory deferral account balances'.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are adjusted in the year in which the same become recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are evaluated at each balance sheet date to ensure that the underlying activities meet the recognition criteria and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with such balances will flow to the entity. If these criteria are not met, the regulatory deferral account balances are derecognized.\n\n## 5.  Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\n## 5.1. Oil and gas exploration activities\n\nAll exploration costs incurred in drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized as 'Exploratory wells-in-progress' under 'Intangible assets under development' till the time these are either transferred to oil and gas assets  when  a well is ready for commercial production or expensed as exploration cost (including allocated depreciation) as and when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case may be.\n\nCosts of exploratory wells are not carried over unless it could be reasonably demonstrated that there are indications of sufficient quantity of reserves and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic & operating viability of the project. All such carried over costs are subject to review for impairment.\n\nCost of surveys and prospecting activities conducted in the search of oil and gas are expensed in the year in which these are incurred.\n\n## 5.2. Coal mining exploration activities\n\nExploration  and  evaluation  assets  comprise  capitalized  costs  which  is  generally  the  expenditure  incurred associated with finding the mineral by carrying out topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, expenditure for activities in relation to evaluation of technical feasibility and commercial viability, acquisition of rights to explore etc.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets under 'Intangible assets under development'and stated at cost less impairment if any. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment indicators at least annually.\n\nOnce the proved reserves are determined and development of mine/project is sanctioned.\n\nExploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of Coal Mines' under 'Capital Work in Progress'. However, if proved reserves are not determined, exploration and evaluation asset is derecognized.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Development expenditure on coal mines\n\nWhen proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of coal mines' under 'Capital work-in-progress'.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/ producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized is net of value of coal extracted during development phase.\n\nDate of commercial operation of integrated coal mines shall be determined on the occurring of earliest of following milestones as provided in CERC tariff regulations:\n\n- 1)   The first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25 % of the peak rated capacity as per the mining plan is achieved; or\n- 2)   The first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production exceeds the total expenditure in that year; or\n- 3)  The date of two years from the date of commencement of production;\n\nOn the date of commercial operation, the assets under capital work-in-progress are classified as a component of property, plant and equipment under 'Mining property'.\n\nGains and losses on de-recognition of assets referred above, are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 6.1. Stripping activity expense/adjustment\n\nExpenditure  incurred  on  removal  of  mine  waste  materials  (overburden)  necessary  to  extract  the  coal reserves is referred to as stripping cost. The Company has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine as technically estimated.\n\nCost of stripping is charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to revenue.\n\nNet of the balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as 'Stripping activity adjustment' under the head 'Non-current assets/Non-current provisions' as the case may be, and adjusted as provided in the CERC Tariff Regulations\n\n## 6.2. Mines closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nThe Company's obligations for land reclamation and decommissioning of structure consist of spending at mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Company estimates its obligations for mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning based on the detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of future cash spending for the required work and provided for as per approved mine closure plan. The estimate of expenses is escalated for inflation and then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risk, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of expenditure required to settle the obligation. The Company recognizes a corresponding asset under property, plant and equipment as a separate item for the cost associated with such obligation.\n\nThe value of the obligation is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds and the same is recognized as finance costs.\n\nFurther, a specific escrow account is maintained for this purpose as per approved mine closure plan. The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis, forming part of the total mine closure obligation, are initially recognized as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn from escrow account after concurrence of the certifying agency.\n\n## 7.  Joint operations\n\nThe Company has joint arrangements with others for operations in the nature of joint operations. The Company recognizes, on a line-by-line basis its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations as per the arrangement which are accounted based on the respective accounting policies of the Company.\n\n## 8.  Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' (b) interest expense on lease liabilities  recognized in accordance with Ind AS 116- 'Leases' and(c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhen the Company borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Company borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.\n\nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use are complete.\n\nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## 9.  Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates, trade discounts and other similar items . Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, surplus and non-moving items of stores and spares is ascertained on review and provided for.\n\nSteel scrap is valued at estimated realizable value.\n\n## 10. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 11. Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Company will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Company for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.\n\n## 12. Fly ash utilization reserve fund\n\nProceeds from sale of ash/ash products along-with income on investment of surplus fund are transferred to 'Fly ash utilization reserve fund' in terms of provisions of gazette notification dated 3 November 2009 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The fund is utilized towards expenditure on development of infrastructure/ facilities, promotion & facilitation activities for use of fly ash.\n\n## 13. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.\n\n## 14. Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it arises with the exception that exchange differences on long term monetary items related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment recognized up to 31 March 2016 are adjusted to the carrying cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. In case of advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency, the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it), is when the Company initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## 15. Revenue\n\nCompany's revenues arise from sale and trading of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, income on assets under lease, supply of coal from integrated coal mines and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, employees, contractors etc., dividend from investments in joint venture & subsidiary companies, dividend from mutual fund investments, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.\n\n## 15.1.  Revenue from sale of energy\n\nThe majority of the Company's operations in India are regulated under the Electricity Act, 2003. Accordingly, the CERC determines the tariff for the Company's power plants based on the norms prescribed in the tariff regulations as applicable from time to time. Tariff is based on the capital cost incurred for a specific power plant and primarily comprises two components: capacity charge i.e. a fixed charge that includes depreciation, return on equity, interest on working capital, operating & maintenance expenses, interest on loan and energy charge i.e. a variable charge primarily based on fuel costs. Tariff for Company's integrated coal mines are also determined by CERC based on the norms prescribed in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the products or services and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when (or as) control over the products or services is transferred to a customer.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.\n\nThe incentives/disincentives are accounted for based on the norms notified/approved by the CERC as per principles enunciated in Ind AS 115 - 'Revenue from contracts with customers'. In cases of power stations where the same have not been notified/approved, incentives/disincentives are accounted for on provisional basis.\n\nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable  is recognized based on the rates,",

Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation account is amortized in the proportion in which depreciation is charged on such exchange differences and same is adjusted against depreciation expense. Fair value changes in respect of forward exchange contracts for derivatives recoverable from/payable to the beneficiaries as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, are recognized in sales.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy through trading is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.\n\nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.\n\n## 15.2.  Revenue from services\n\nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.\n\nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.\n\nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.\n\n## 15.3.  Other income\n\nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For credit impaired financial assets the EIR is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance). EIR is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. For purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortized cost of the POCI assets.\n\nScrap other than steel scrap is accounted for as and when sold.\n\nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.\n\nRevenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nFor debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recorded using the EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the EIR, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee benefits\n\n## 16.1.  Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefits expense in statement of profit and loss in the period during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due after more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.\n\nThe Company has a defined contribution pension scheme which is administered through a separate trust. The obligation of the Company is to contribute to the trust to the extent of amount not exceeding 30% of basic pay and dearness allowance less employer's contribution towards provident fund, gratuity, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF) or any other retirement benefits. The Company's contribution towards pension is made to National Pension Trust (NPS) for the employees opted for the scheme. The contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme of the Company/NPS for the year are recognized as an expense and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 16.2.  Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company's liability towards gratuity, pension scheme at two of the stations in respect of taken over employees from the erstwhile state government power utility, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF), baggage allowance for settlement at home town after retirement, farewell gift on retirement and provident fund scheme to the extent of interest liability on provident fund contribution are in the nature of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company pays fixed contribution to the provident fund at predetermined rates to a separate trust, which invests the funds in permitted securities. The contributions to the fund for the year are recognized as expense and are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The obligation of the Company is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India.\n\nThe gratuity is funded by the Company and is managed by separate trust. The Company has PRMF, under which retired employee and the spouse are provided medical facilities in the Company hospitals/empaneled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Company.\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Company if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.  Remeasurement comprising of actuarial gain and losses, return on plan assets (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability)  & effect of asset ceiling (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability)  and  the  same  are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they arise.\n\nPast service costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Company recognizes related restructuring costs. If a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs,the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used for the re-measurement.\n\n## 16.3.  Other long-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits under the Company's leave encashment, long-service award and economic rehabilitation scheme constitute",

Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\nA liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under performance related pay if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## 17. Other expenses\n\nExpenses on ex-gratia payments under voluntary retirement scheme, training & recruitment and voluntary community development are charged to statement of profit and loss in the year incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research is charged to revenue as and when incurred. Expenditure on development is charged to revenue as and when incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for intangible asset as per Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets'.\n\nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno economic clearance are charged to statement of profit and loss.\n\nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.\n\nTransit and handling losses of coal as per Company's norms are included in cost of coal.\n\n## 18. Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient taxable profits will be available in future to allow all or part of deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nAdditional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognized at the same time that the liability to\n\n<!-- image -->",

The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the Company originally recognized those past transactions or events.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability.  MAT credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which MAT credit can be utilized.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Company assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognized. The effect of the uncertainty is recognized using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Company evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## 19. Leases\n\n## 19.1.  As lessee\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments.  In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Company changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\n\n## 19.2.  As lessor\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the customer the right to control the use of the underlying asset. Arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to customers/suppliers to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments are identified as either finance leases or operating leases.",

Capacity payments are apportioned between capital repayments relating to the provision of the plant, finance income and service income.  The finance income element of the capacity payment is recognized as revenue, using a rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in each period. The service income element of the capacity payment is the difference between the total capacity payment and the amount recognized as finance income and capital repayments and recognized as revenue as it is earned.\n\nThe amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as financial assets, classified as 'Finance lease receivables', at the amount  equal  to the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for operating leases\n\nWhere the Company determines a long term PPA to be or to contain a lease and where the Company retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement is considered an operating lease.\n\nFor operating leases, the power plant is capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its economic life. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 20. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - 'Impairment of Assets'. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 'cash-generating unit', or 'CGU').\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## 21. Operating segments\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 108-'Operating segments', the operating segments used to present segment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Company's management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Company's 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' or 'CODM' within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, finance costs, income tax expenses and corporate income that are not directly attributable to segments.\n\nRevenue directly attributable to the segments is considered as segment revenue. Expenses directly attributable to the segments and common expenses allocated on a reasonable basis are considered as segment expenses.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, Capital Wok in Progress, intangible assets other than goodwill and intangible assets under development.\n\nSegment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, capital work in progress, intangible assets under development, advances for capital expenditures, trade and other receivables, inventories and other assets that can be directly or reasonably allocated to segments. For the purpose of segment reporting, property, plant and equipment have been allocated to segments based on the extent of usage of assets for operations attributable to the respective\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unallocated assets comprise investments, income tax assets, corporate assets and other assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\nSegment liabilities include all operating liabilities in respect of a segment and consist principally of trade payable, payable for capital expenditure and other payables, provision for employee benefits and other provisions. Unallocated liabilities comprise equity, income tax liabilities, loans and borrowings and other liabilities and provisions that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\n## 22. Business Combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Company. The consideration transferred in the acquisition and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair values on their acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Where the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognized as capital reserve. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## 23. Dividends\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.\n\n## 24. Material prior period errors\n\nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.\n\n## 25. Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per equity share are also computed using the earnings amounts excluding the movements in regulatory deferral account balances.\n\n## 26. Statement of cash flows\n\nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7-'Statement of cash flows'.\n\n## 27. Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## 27.1.  Financial assets\n\nInitial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nA 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a)   The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- (b)  Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTOCI (Fair value through OCI)\n\nA 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n\n- (a)  The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- (b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI\n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTPL (Fair value through profit or loss)\n\nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\n\nIn addition, the Company may elect to classify a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Interest income on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## Investment in Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments in entities other than subsidiaries and joint venture companies are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on sale/ disposal of investments. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on sale / disposal of the investments.\n\nEquity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\nEquity investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures companies are accounted at cost less impairment, if any.\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of investments at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except for equity instruments classified as at FVTOCI, where such differences are recorded in OCI.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12month ECL.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.\n\n## 27.2.  Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of  profit and  loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 27.3.  Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## 27.4.  Derivative financial instruments\n\nInitial recognition and subsequent measurement\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks of foreign currency loans. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 27.5.  Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## 28. Non -Current Assets Held for Sale\n\nThe Company classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.\n\nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less cost to sell.\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n\n## D.  Use of estimates and management judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:\n\n## 1.  Formulation of accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\nUseful life of the assets of the generation of electricity business and integrated coal mines (where tariff is regulated) is determined by the CERC Tariff Regulations in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## 3.  Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 4.   Defined benefit plans and long-term employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of salary increases and the inflation rate. The Company considers that the assumptions used to measure its obligations are appropriate and documented. However, any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the resulting calculations.\n\n## 5.  Revenues\n\nThe Company records revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 6.  Leases not in legal form of lease\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Company, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.\n\n## 7.  Assets held for sale\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply the accounting of non-current assets held for sale under Ind AS 105 - 'Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. In assessing the applicability, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the availability of the asset for immediate sale, management's commitment for the sale and probability of sale within one year to conclude if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\n## 8.  Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nRecognition of regulatory deferral account balances involves significant judgments including about future tariff regulations since these are based on estimation of the amounts expected to be recoverable/payable through tariff in future.\n\n## 9.  Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37-'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'. The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.\n\n## 10. Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies\n\nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Company. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 11. Income taxes\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company has continued to classify this arrangement with its customer as lease based on the practical expedient provided in  Ind AS 116.  Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation, interest on loan capital & return on equity (pre-tax) components from the beneficiary are continued to be adjusted against FLR. The interest component of the FLR and amount received on account of revision of tariff of previous periods in respect of the above three elements are continued to be recognised as 'Interest income on Assets under finance lease' under 'Revenue from operations' (Note 34).\n- d)    As per the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India for preparation of Mine Closure Plan, Escrow Accounts have been opened for each captive mine and the balances held in these escrow accounts are presented as 'Mine closure deposit'. Up to 80% of the total deposited amount including interest accrued in the escrow account shall be released after every five years in line with the periodic examination of the closure plan as per the Guidelines. Interest earned on the escrow account is added to mine closure deposit account.\n\n## 10.

As per this policy, an agreement has been signed between the Company and the Ministry of Railways, GOI on 6 June 2016. As per the agreement, railway projects agreed between the Company and Railways will be constructed, maintained and operated by Railways and ownership of the line and its operations and maintenance will always remain with them. Railways will pay upto 7% of the amount invested through freight rebate on freight volumes every year till the funds provided by the Company are fully recovered along-with interest (equal to the prevailing rate of dividend payable by Railways at the time of signing of respective agreements), subject to the rebate not exceeding the freight amount in the accounting year, after commercial operation date (COD) of the railway projects. The advance is adjusted at projects which have achieved COD based on confirmation from Railways towards freight rebate in consonance with the agreement terms and the interest portion is recognised in Note-35-'Other income'.\n- e)   Secured capital advances are secured against the hypothecation of the construction equipment/material supplied by the contractors/suppliers.\n- f) Loans given to employees are measured at amortized cost. The deferred payroll expenditure represents the benefits on account of interest rate on loans being lower than the market rate of interest. The same is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the loan.\n\n## 11.

C.4 (Note 1). Refer Note 64 for detailed disclosures.\n- b) CERC Tariff Regulations, 2019 provide for recovery of deferred tax liability (DTL) as at 31 March 2009 from the beneficiaries. Accordingly, DTL as at 31 March 2009 is recoverable on materialisation from the beneficiaries. Regulations, 2014 and Regulations, 2019 provide for grossing-up the rate of return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income.

During the outbreak of COVID-19, including recent surge in the number of cases, the Company has ensured the availability of its power plants to generate power and has continued to supply power during the period of lockdown. In line with the directions of MOP dated 15 & 16 May 2020, issued in accordance with the announcement of GOI under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Special Economic and Comprehensive package, to allow a rebate of between 20%-25% on the capacity charges during the lock down period subject to approval of the Board, an amount of ' 1,363.00 crore has been approved by the Board, to be allowed during the year 2020-21. The entire amount has since been accounted for and disclosed as exceptional item.\n- b)   CERC issued an order dated 3 April 2020 whereby it was directed that Late Payment Surcharge (LPSC) shall apply at a reduced rate of 12% p.a. instead of the normal rate of 18% p.a. on the payments becoming overdue during the period from 24 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 to contain the impact of COVID-19. Further, GOI has notified Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021 on 22 February 2021.These rules envisage that base rate of LPSC to be considered as SBI one year MCLR, as on 1 April of the financial year, plus five percent. The rate of LPSC shall be increased by 0.5 percent for every month of delay, provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n- c) Further, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, the Company has deferred the capacity charges to DISCOMS for the lockdown period for the power not scheduled to be payable without interest after the lock down period in three equal monthly installments. The impact on profit for the the year due to the reduction in LPSC rate and deferment of capacity charges, is not material.\n\nThe demand for power is continuously increasing with increase in economic activities in the Country, although demand may get impacted in short term due to lock downs in certain parts of the country.The Management does not anticipate any material medium to long-term impact on the financial position of the Company. The Company will continue to closely",

There are no unconfirmed balances in respect of bank accounts and borrowings from banks & financial institutions. With regard to receivables for energy sales, the Company sends demand intimations to the beneficiaries with details of amount paid and balance outstanding which can be said to be automatically confirmed on receipt of subsequent payment from such beneficiaries. In addition, reconciliation with beneficiaries and other customers is generally done on quarterly basis. So far as trade/other payables and loans and advances are concerned, the balance confirmation letters/emails with the negative assertion as referred in the Standard on Auditing (SA) 505 (Revised) 'External Confirmations', were sent to the parties. Some of such balances are subject to confirmation/reconciliation. Adjustments, if any will be accounted for on confirmation/reconciliation of the same, which in the opinion of the management will not have a material impact.\n- b)   In the opinion of the management, the value of assets, other than property, plant and equipment and non-current investments, on realisation in the ordinary course of business, will not be less than the value at which these are stated in the Balance Sheet.\n- c) The levy of transit fee/entry tax on supplies of fuel to some of the power stations has been paid under protest as the matters are sub-judice at various courts. In case the Company gets refund/demand from fuel suppliers/tax authorities on settlement of these cases, the same will be passed on to respective beneficiaries.\n- 45. a) On 7 February 2021, a massive unprecedented flood consisting of debris and muck, silt, boulders, rock pieces, etc. caused by glacier burst in the upstream of the project in the  Himalayas, hit a part of the Company's under construction 520 MW hydropower project in the state of Uttarakhand. This  resulted in large scale inundation and silting at the project site, especially the barrage intake structure, desilting chamber/basin and adjoining facilities including their approach. However, the main power house and dam was  not significantly affected by the floods. Most of the mechanical and electrical equipment are in safe condition.\n\nIndustry Experts engaged by the Company including experienced officials of the Company, are preparing a comprehensive assessment -cum- action plan for restoration of the project. It is anticipated that the restoration work may take time up to the end of the next financial year i.e. 2021-22, which is being closely monitored by the Company. Insurance cover is available for the loss/damage caused. The company is committed to the completion of the project at the earliest.\n\nThe carrying cost of the project as at 31 March 2021 is ' 5,337.69 crore (31 March 2020: ' 4,868.79 crore). Damage to the project due to the calamity is indemnifiable as stated above and Management is of the view that there would not be any material impact on the financials and confident that any additional expenditure consequent to the natural calamity, would be covered as part of project cost as per Tariff Regulations, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n\n- b) The Company is executing a hydro power project in the state of Uttarakhand, where all the clearances were accorded. A case was filed in Hon'ble Supreme Court of India after the natural disaster in Uttarakhand in June 2013 to review whether the various existing and ongoing hydro projects have contributed to environmental degradation. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 7 May 2014, ordered that no further construction shall be undertaken in the projects under consideration until further orders, which included the said hydro project of the Company. In the proceedings, Hon'ble Supreme Court is examining to allow few projects which have all clearances which includes the project of the Company where the work has been stopped. Aggregate cost incurred on the project up to 31 March 2021 is ' 163.86 crore (31 March 2020: ' 163.40 crore). Management is confident that the approval for proceeding with the project shall be granted, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n- 46.  a)   The environmental clearance ('clearance') granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India (MoEF) for one of the Company's project consisting of three units of 800 MW each, was challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT disposed off the appeal, inter alia, directing that the order of clearance be remanded to the MoEF to pass an order granting or declining clearance to the project proponent afresh in accordance with the law and the judgement of the NGT and for referring the matter to the Expert Appraisal Committee ('Committee') for its re-scrutiny, which shall complete the process within six months from the date of NGT order. NGT also directed that the environmental clearance shall be kept in abeyance and the Company shall maintain status quo in relation to the project during the period of review by the Committee or till fresh order is passed by the MoEF, whichever is earlier. The Company filed an appeal challenging the NGT order before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India which stayed the order of the NGT and the matter is sub-judice. All the units of the project have been declared commercial in the earlier years. The carrying cost of the project as at 31 March 2021 is ' 15,115.02 crore (31 March 2020: ' 15,662.28 crore). Management is confident that the approval for the project shall be granted, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The project construction commenced in the year 2016 after obtaining the requisite approval and Environment Clearance (EC) from MOEF&CC (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change). On 27 May 2021, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed an order instructing MOEF&CC to keep the EC granted for the project in abeyance for a period of seven months or till the period the re-appraisal is done and additional conditions imposed by the MOEF&CC, whichever is earlier. NGT has further directed the  MOEF&CC to conduct additional studies pertaining to Environment Impact Assessment of the project, to be carried out through the company, for  further assessment  by its Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and  get recommendations of the EAC for imposing additional conditions by the MOEF&CC, if any, on the company for allowing the units to operate. The Company has obtained advice of prominent legal experts and has filed an appeal before Hon'ble Supreme Court of India against the directions of NGT.  Both the units of the project are in advanced stage of construction and commissioning of the units is envisaged in the next year. The carrying cost of the project as at 31 March 2021 is ' 9,376.31 crore (31 March 2020: ' 8,017.48 crore). Management is confident that the approval for the continuation of the project shall be granted, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n\n## 47. Disclosure as per Ind AS 1 'Presentation of financial statements'\n\n## a) Changes in significant accounting policies:\n\nDuring the year, following changes to the accounting policies have been made:\n\n- i) CERC has notified Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2021, dated 19 February 2021. These amendments are  applicable to a generating company which has the arrangement for supply of coal or lignite from the integrated mine(s) allocated to it, for one or more of its specified end use generating stations, whose tariff is required to be determined by the Commission. The company has integrated coal mines and hence these amendments are applicable to the Company. Consequently, related significant accounting policies viz.

As per Para 64 of Ind AS 19, in case of surplus in a defined benefit plan, an entity shall measure the net defined benefit asset at the lower of actual surplus or the value of the assets ceiling determined using the discount rate. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Further, paragraph 65 provides that a net defined benefit asset may arise where a defined benefit plan has been overfunded or where actuarial gains have arisen.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Company has no right to the benefits either in the form of refund from the plan or lower future contribution to the plan towards the net surplus of ' 94.41crore (31 March 2020: ' 75.05 crore) determined through actuarial valuation. Accordingly,\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gratuity and pension\n\n- a) The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has rendered continuous service of five years or more is entitled to gratuity at 15 days salary (15/26 X last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance) for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ' 0.20 crore on superannuation, resignation, termination, disablement or on death, considering the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, as amended. The gratuity scheme is funded by the Company and is managed by separate trust.

Further, the expected return on plan assets is determined considering several applicable factors mainly the composition of plan assets held, assessed risk of asset management and historical returns from plan assets.\n\n## ii. Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.\n\n| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2020   | As at 31 March 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                          | Increase              | Decrease              | Increase              | Decrease              |\n| Discount rate (0.5% movement)            | (169.87)              | 178.76                | (156.74)              | 167.38                |\n| Annual increase in costs (0.5% movement) | 78.57                 | (76.36)               | 72.75                 | (68.58)               |\n| Salary escalation rate (0.5% movement)   | 98.22                 | (93.17)               | 96.57                 | (91.08)               |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## G.    Risk exposure\n\nThrough its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\n## a)   Asset volatility\n\nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Most of the plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level. A portion of the funds are invested in equity securities and in alternative investments which have low correlation with equity securities. The Company has a risk management strategy where the aggregate amount of risk exposure on a portfolio level is maintained at a fixed range. Any deviations from the range are corrected by rebalancing the portfolio. The Company intends to maintain the above investment mix in the continuing years.\n\n## b)   Changes in discount rate\n\nA decrease in discount rate will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' assets holdings.\n\n## c)   Inflation risks\n\nIn the pension plans, the pension payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## d)   Life expectancy\n\nThe pension plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\n\nThe Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee benefit plans. Within this framework, the Company's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.\n\nThe Company actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Company has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Company uses derivatives to manage some of its\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.\n\nA large portion of assets consist of government and corporate bonds. The plan asset mix is in compliance with the requirements of the respective local regulations.\n\n## H.

(Also refer Note 20 (e)(i))\n\n## 56.   Disclosure as per Ind AS 36 'Impairment of Assets'\n\nAs required by Ind AS 36, an assessment of impairment of assets was carried out and based on such assessment, the Company has accounted  impairment losses as under:\n\n- a)    For the Company, the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment & intangible assets of the Cash Generating Units (CGU) is value in use and amounts to ' 2,54,366.54 crore (31 March 2020: ' 2,39,455.07 crore). This includes the carrying value of one of the  thermal power stations of the Company (460 MW) whose operations have been discontinued w.e.f. the end of 31 March 2021, amounting to ' 213.64 crore. The net realisable value of the assets of the station has been assessed which is more than its carrying value.\n- The discount rate used for the computation of value in use for the generating plant (thermal, gas and hydro) and coal mining is 7.74 % (31 March 2020: 8.00%) and for solar plant is 7.57 % (31 March 2020: 7.78%).\n- b) The Company has investments in M/s Ratnagiri Gas & Power Pvt. Ltd. (RGPPL), an erstwhile joint venture of the Company. RGPPL had incurred losses during last few years which has resulted in substantial erosion of net worth of RGPPL. Also, value of RGPPL's assets had declined significantly more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use. Further, Power Block (CGU) of RGPPL is not operating at its installed capacity from last many years. The recoverable amount of this investment was assessed at ' 18.06 crore and accordingly the Company had provision for impairment of ' 816.49 crore in respect of such investment as at 31 March 2020. During the year, the assessment of impairment of its investment in RGPPL has been carried out by an independent expert, impact of which is explained below:\n\nRecoverable amount is based on the value in use as its fair value less cost of disposals cannot be estimated.\n\nRecoverable amount of investment in RGPPL has been assessed at ' Nil and is based on the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from gas based power plant of RGPPL till 31 March 2039. The period is based on the estimated useful life of the power plant. Decrease in recoverable amount of investment in RGPPL is due to decrease in the value in use as compared to the previous year. This has led to addition in provision for impairment by ' 18.06 crore in the current year (31 March 2020: impairment provision of ' 41.47 crore).\n\nFollowing  are  the  key  assumptions  used  to  determine  the  recoverable  amount  of  investment:\n\n- - Capacity\n\n:  1,967 MW (31 March 2020: 1,967 MW)\n\n- Auxiliary consumption  :  2.00% (31 March 2020: 2.00 %)\n\n- Plant Load Factor (PLF)  :  25.40% (31 March 2020: 25.40%)\n\n- Tariff                               :  INR 5.5/kwh (31 March 2020: INR 5.5/kwh)\n\n(gross of transmission charges and losses)\n\nNo growth rates have been assumed and the past experience have been considered for future cash flows which are expected to be derived.\n\nThe post-tax discount rate used for the future cash flows is 12.50% (31 March 2020: 11.50%).\n\nRGPPL has become  a subsidiary during the year. Refer Note 6 (d) in this regard.\n\n- c)   In respect of investment in NTPC BHEL Power Project Pvt. Ltd., provision for impairment on investments has been recognised at ' 50.00 crore (31 March 2020: ' 50.00 crore). Also refer Note 6 b).\n- d)   In respect of investment in Trincomalee Power Company Limited , provision for impairment on investments has been recognised at ' 14.14 crore (31 March 2020: Nil ).\n- e)    In respect of investment in Konkan LNG Limited (KLL), the impairment provision accounted upto 31 March 2020 amounting to ' 103.47  crore has been written back consequent to disposal of investment in KLL during the year. Also refer Note 6 d).\n\n<!-- image -->",

On 17 January 2020 unconditional BG was submitted by the operator to Registrar General and ' 500.00 crore was released to the operator by the Hon'ble High Court. As per order of Hon'ble High Court, formal handing over of the infrastructure started on 20 January 2020 at the project site. However, due to certain local administrative issues initially and further due to Covid-19 pandemic, Local Commissioner's visit had to be deferred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(ONGC) was the operator and the Company along-with the consortium partners have relinquished both the blocks to Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).\n\nBased on the un-audited statement of the accounts for the above blocks forwarded by ONGC, the operator, the Company's share in the assets and liabilities and expenses is as under:\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars         | As at   31 March 2021  (Unaudited)   | As at   31 March 2020  (Unaudited)   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Assets              | 0.01                                 | 0.01                                 |\n| Liabilities         | 0.49                                 | 0.49                                 |\n| Capital commitments | -                                    | -                                    |\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, there are no income / expense  and operating/investing cash flow from exploration activities.\n\nFor exploration activities in block KG-OSN-2009/4 DGH has agreed for drilling of one well and have instructed to carry out airborne Full Tensor Gravity Gradiometer (FTG) survey in conditionally & partial cleared area. ONGC has completed drilling of one well. Airborne Full Tensor Gravity Gradiometer (FTG) survey work is also completed. The Company along-with the consortium partners has decided to relinquish the block and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), the operator, has submitted an application to Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) in this regard, in the earlier years.\n\n- b) Exploration activities in the block AA-ONN-2003/2 were abandoned in January 2011 due to unforeseen geological conditions and withdrawal of the operator. Attempts to reconstitute the consortium to accomplish the residual exploratory activities did not yield result. In the meanwhile, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, GoI demanded in January 2011 the cost of unfinished minimum work programme from the consortium with NTPC's share being USD 7.516 million. During the year, provision in this respect has been updated to ' 103.88 crore from ' 101.04 crore along-with interest.

The Company carried out the detailed exploration and preparation of Geological Report (GR) and Mining Plan through M/s. CMPDIL. Due to the geo-mining constraints, likely less percentage of coal extraction in these two adjacent coal blocks and nonavailability of any non-coal bearing land in the vicinity for OB dumping, the Company approached Ministry of Coal on 26 December 2020 for surrendering of these blocks, with a request for consideration of reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the Company.  Further, as per the Coal Block Development and Production Agreement (CBDPA) signed by the Company with MOC in respect of these blocks, the performance security (BG) submitted by the Company shall be released in the event of termination of agreement by the Company upon submitting the mine plan and the Company has requested for release of the same.",

Keeping in view the above, an amount of ' 121.57 crore has been accounted as recoverable and included under 'Other current assets- financial assets'. Balance amount of ' 5.33 crore has been provided for in the Statement of profit and loss with a corresponding provision for unserviceable intangible assets under development (Note-5).\n\n- c) Mandakini-B coal block was also unexplored at the time of allotment by GOI. The Company carried out detailed exploration and preparation of GR and Mining Plan through M/s CMPDIL. MOC approved the Mining Plan, but the mine development activities could not be proceeded due to the resistance of the villagers which was beyond the control of the Company. The villagers did not allow to start site specific studies like Socio Economic survey, EIA/ EMP studies and other initial block development activities since last two and half years due to their unreasonable demands for land compensation, permanent employment, etc. Considering the delay in block development activities beyond control, the Company has approached Ministry of Coal  on 26 December 2020 for surrendering these blocks, with a request for consideration of reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Company.\n\nAn amount of ' 93.40 crore has been incurred in this coal block towards exploration & GR, preparation of mining plan, feasibility report, area drainage study, etc. The Company expects that whenever these two coal blocks are allotted to any other company, the cost incurred towards exploration and GR would be reimbursed from the new allocatee through MOC as per past experience of the Company.Keeping in view the above, an amount of ' 53.93 crore has been accounted as recoverable and included under 'Other current assets- financial assets'.

The Company invoked the dispute resolution clause contained in clause 25 (Governing Law and Dispute resolution) of the Allotment Agreement and requested to hold appropriate discussions as provided in the dispute resolution clause. However, the BG (Performance Security) of ' 168.00 crore was encashed by MOC on 22 March 2021 citing delay in achieving of the milestones of efficiency parameters which were beyond the control of the Company. The Company has approached MOP on 30 March 2021 to take up the matter in Alternate Mechanism for Resolution of CPSE Disputes (AMRCD). Pending resolution of the dispute through AMRCD, the amount of BG encashed by MOC has been disclosed as recoverable from MOC under 'Claims recoverable' in Note-17-'Current assets-Other financial assets'.

The Company has taken adequate measures to address such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices.\n\nIn order to institutionalize the risk management in the Company, an elaborate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework has been developed. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. As a part of the implementation of ERM framework, a 'Risk Management Committee (RMC)' with functional directors as its members has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks, formulate action plans and strategies to mitigate risks on short-term as well as long-term basis.\n\nThe RMC meets every quarter to deliberate on strategies. Risks are regularly monitored through reporting of key performance indicators. Outcomes of RMC are submitted for information of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises principally from trade receivables, unbilled revenue, loans, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\n## Trade receivables & unbilled revenue\n\nThe Company primarily sells electricity to bulk customers comprising mainly state utilities owned by State Governments. The Company has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC) backed by the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA). The TPAs were signed among the Govt. of India, RBI and the individual State Governments subsequent to the issuance of the One Time Settlement Scheme of SEBs dues during 2001-02 by the GOI, which were valid till October 2016. Govt of India subsequently approved the extension of these TPAs for another period of 10 years. Most of the States have signed these extended TPAs and signing is in progress for the balance states.\n\nCERC Tariff Regulations allow payment against monthly bill towards energy charges within a period of forty five days from the date of bill and levy of surcharge @ 18% p.a. on delayed payment beyond forty five days. GOI has notified Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021 on 22 February 2021.These rules envisage that base rate of LPSC to be considered as SBI one year MCLR, as on 1 April of the financial year, plus five percent. The rate of LPSC shall be increased by 0.5 percent for every month of delay, provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n\nA default occurs when in the view of management there is no significant possibility of recovery of receivables after considering all available options for recovery.\n\nAs per the provisions of the TPA, the customers are required to establish LC covering 105% of the average monthly billing of the Company for last 12 months. The TPA also provided that if there is any default in payment of current dues by any State Utility, the outstanding dues can be deducted from the State's RBI account and paid to the concerned CPSU. There is also provision of regulation of power by the Company in case of non payment of dues and non-establishment of LC.\n\nIn addition to above, MoP vide its communications dated 28 June 2019 and  subsequent clarifications, further emphasised on ensuring availability of suitable payment security mechanism to be maintained by DISCOMs. Further, to liquidate the outstanding dues of the discoms towards the generating companies, GOI has announced a Scheme for offering ' 90,000 crore in soft loans under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package. The Discoms are expected to take the benefit of the this Scheme and pay their outstanding dues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised.\n\n- (b)  Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using life-time expected credit losses as per simplified approach\n\nThe Company has customers (State government utilities) with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible or nil. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. Hence, no impairment loss has been recognised during the reporting periods in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## (iii) Ageing analysis of trade receivables\n\nThe ageing analysis of the trade receivables is as below:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Ageing                                     | Not due   | 0-30 days  past due   | 31-60 days  past due   | 61-90 days  past due   |   91-120 days  past due | More than  120 days  past due   | Total     |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|\n| Gross carrying amount as  at 31 March 2021 | 6,216.60  | 1,947.74              | 975.89                 | 504.50                 |                   409.3 | 3,647.89                        | 13,701.92 |\n| Gross carrying amount as  at 31 March 2020 | 4,751.62  | 2,993.12              | 1,718.48               | 1,015.49               |                   507.9 | 4,628.78                        | 15,615.39 |\n\n## (iv) Reconciliation of impairment loss provisions\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of financial assets during the year is as follows:\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars                        |   Investments | Trade  receivables   | Advances   | Claims  recoverable   | Total    |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Balance as at 1 April 2019         |        969.24 | 0.34                 | 0.06       | 15.07                 | 984.71   |\n| Impairment loss recognised         |         41.48 | -                    | -          | -                     | 41.48    |\n| Amounts written off / written back |         36.28 | 0.14                 | -          | 14.95                 | 51.37    |\n| Balance as at 31 March 2020        |        974.44 | 0.20                 | 0.06       | 0.12                  | 974.82   |\n| Impairment loss recognised         |         32.2  | -                    | -          | 343.51                | 375.71   |\n| Amounts written off / written back |        103.47 | -                    | 0.03       | 0.01                  | 103.51   |\n| Balance as at 31 March 2021        |        903.17 | 0.20                 | 0.03       | 343.62                | 1,247.02 |\n\nBased on historic default rates, the Company believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of any other financial assets as the amounts of such allowances are not significant.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe Company has an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and longterm funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Short-term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by the Treasury department. The Board of directors has established policies to manage liquidity risk and the Company's Treasury department operates in line with such policies. Any breaches of these policies are reported to the Board of Directors. Long-term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board of Directors and appropriate decisions are taken according to the situation.\n\nTypically, the Company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a month, including the servicing of financial obligations, this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.\n\nAs part of the CERC Regulations, tariff inter-alia includes recovery of capital cost. The tariff regulations also provide for recovery of energy charges, operations and maintenance expenses and interest on normative working capital requirements. Since billing to the customers are generally on a monthly basis, the Company maintains sufficient liquidity to service financial obligations and to meet its operational requirements.\n\n## (i)   Financing arrangements\n\nThe Company had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| Particulars              | As at  31 March 2021   | As at  31 March 2020 '  Crore   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Floating-rate borrowings |                        |                                 |\n| Cash credit              | 2,465.00               | 2,767.13                        |\n| Term loans               | 3,533.60               | 8,145.00                        |\n| Foreign currency loans   | 4,617.56               | 3,993.15                        |\n| Total                    | 10,616.16              | 14,905.28                       |\n\n## (ii)  Maturities of financial liabilities\n\nThe following are the contractual maturities of derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities, based on contractual cash flows:\n\n## 31 March 2021\n\n' Crore\n\n| Contractual maturities of financial liabilities                         | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                         | 3 months  or less        | 3-12  months             | 1-2 years                | 2-5 years                | More than  5 years       | Total                    |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                                    |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Secured bonds                                                           | 806.71                   | 1,541.51                 | 6,044.87                 |                          | 12,862.47   18,783.99    | 40,039.55                |\n| Unsecured bonds                                                         | 274.73                   | 170.57                   | -                        | 8,374.10                 | 3,500.00                 | 12,319.40                |\n| Rupee term loans from banks                                             | 678.75                   | 2,305.98                 | 3,962.45                 |                          | 16,379.51   41,610.88    | 64,937.57                |\n| Rupee term loans from others                                            | 18.03                    | 16.67                    | 33.34                    | 16.57                    | -                        | 84.61                    |\n| Lease obligations                                                       | 140.77                   | 50.00                    | 65.95                    | 170.17                   | 2,229.13                 | 2,656.02                 |\n| Foreign currency notes                                                  | 182.29                   | 4,841.95                 | 5,611.00                 | 10,738.70                | 7,326.40                 | 28,700.34                |\n| Unsecured foreign currency loans from banks  and financial institutions | 161.41                   | 1,026.29                 | 686.98                   | 2,088.80                 | 11,376.01                | 15,339.49                |\n| Unsecured foreign currency loans  (guaranteed by GOI)                   | -                        | 200.10                   | 197.30                   | 591.89                   | 624.16                   | 1,613.45                 |\n| Commercial paper and cash credit                                        | 8,500.00                 | 4,500.00                 | -                        | -                        | -                        | 13,000.00                |\n| Trade and other payables                                                | 17,078.78                | 6,600.78                 | 829.01                   | 1,788.07                 | 2,068.78                 | 28,365.42                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for setting up of policies and procedures to manage market risks of the Company. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the risk management committee.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain transactions that are denominated in a currency other than entity's functional currency, hence exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.\n\nThe currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 are as below:\n\n## As at 31 March 2021\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                                             | USD       | EURO     | JPY       | Others    | Total     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets                                                        |           |          |           |           |           |\n| Trade and other receivables                                             | 0.23      | -        | -         | -         | 0.23      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                               | 0.40      | -        | -         | 0.04      | 0.44      |\n| Other financial assets                                                  | 1.41      | 0.01     | 0.83      | 0.53      | 2.78      |\n| Total                                                                   | 2.04      | 0.01     | 0.83      | 0.57      | 3.45      |\n| Financial liabilities                                                   |           |          |           |           |           |\n| Foreign currency bonds                                                  | 21,227.65 | 4,384.00 | -         | 3,088.69* | 28,700.34 |\n| Unsecured foreign currency loans from banks  and financial institutions | 2,879.03  | 1,253.24 | 12,820.67 | -         | 16,952.94 |\n| Trade payables and other financial liabilities                          | 1,870.15  | 799.49   | 67.85     | 1.31      | 2,738.80  |\n| Total                                                                   | 25,976.83 | 6,436.73 | 12,888.52 | 3,090.00  | 48,392.08 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, currency risk in respect of such exposure would not be very significant.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSince the impact of strengthening or weakening of INR against USD, Euro, JPY and other currencies on the statement of profit and loss would not be very significant; therefore, sensitivity analysis for currency risk is not disclosed.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nCertain contracts of the Company for construction of power plants with vendors awarded through International Competitive Bidding are denominated in a third currency i.e. a currency which is not the functional currency of any of the parties to the contract. The Company has examined the applicability of provisions of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' for accounting of embedded derivatives in such contracts considering the opinion of the Expert Advisory Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India in this regard.\n\nThe Company has awarded the above contracts without any intention to enter into any derivative contract or to leverage/ take position and without any option/intention to net settle at any point of time during the tenure of the contract. Such contracts, which normally have a tenure ranging from three to ten years, consist of numerous items having varied dates of delivery and payment schedule. Further, forward exchange rates are not realistically available for such longer periods. Accordingly, the Company is of the view that separately recognising the foreign currency derivative embedded in such contracts is impracticable. Moreover, the option available under Ind AS 109 to designate the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss is also not considered practical in the absence of a reliable valuation model.\n\nFurther, the Company is a rate regulated entity whose tariffs are determined by CERC using a cost plus methodology for which, the actual costs incurred on account of property, plant and equipment is considered for determining the capital base for fixation of tariff. Moreover, the impact on the financial statements will not be material  having regard to outstanding contracts as at the year end and also the fact that the Company is in the regulatory environment for which the provisions of Ind AS 114-'Regulatory deferral accounts' are applicable. Hence, the Company has continued to account for such contracts without separately recognising the foreign currency derivative embedded therein.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising mainly from non-current borrowings with floating interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The Company manages the interest rate risks by entering into different kinds of loan arrangements with varied terms (e.g. fixed rate loans, floating rate loans, rupee term loans, foreign currency loans, etc.).",

This includes a valuation team that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements and reports directly to the Director (Finance). The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Company's Audit Committee.\n\nFair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investments in quoted equity instruments. Quoted equity instruments are valued using quoted prices on national stock exchange.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. This level includes mutual funds which are valued using the closing NAV.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities included in Level 3 is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from prevailing market transactions and dealer quotes of similar instruments.\n\nThere have been no transfers in either direction for the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.\n\n## c) Valuation technique used to determine fair value:\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to fair value of financial instruments include:\n\n- i) For financial instruments other than at ii), iii) and iv) - the use of quoted market prices\n- ii) For investments in mutual funds - Closing NAV is used.\n- iii) For financial liabilities (vendor liabilities, debentures/bonds, foreign currency notes, domestic/foreign currency loans): Discounted cash flow; appropriate market borrowing rate of the entity as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n- iv) For financial assets (employee loans) - Discounted cash flow; appropriate market rate (SBI lending rate) as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n\n## d)     Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                            | Level   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2020   | As at 31 March 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                        |         | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            |\n| Financial assets                                       |         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Investments in subsidiary and joint venture  companies | 3       | 28,028.57             | 28,028.57             | 26,350.61             | 26,350.61             |\n| Loans                                                  | 3       | 1,914.94              | 1,922.84              | 908.82                | 919.25                |\n| Finance lease receivables                              | 3       | 437.77                | 437.77                | 464.37                | 464.37                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosure as per Ind AS 114, 'Regulatory Deferral Accounts'\n\n## (i) Nature of rate regulated activities\n\nThe Company is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity. The price to be charged by the Company for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC which provides extensive guidance on the principles and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return.\n\nThis form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations which provide the Company to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement\n\n- (a)  As per the CERC Tariff Regulations, any gain or loss on account of exchange risk variation during the construction period shall form part of the capital cost till the declaration of Commercial Operation Date (COD) to be considered for calculation of tariff. The CERC during the past period in tariff orders for various stations has allowed exchange differences incurred during the construction period in the capital cost. Accordingly, exchange differences arising during the construction period is within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nFurther, any loss or gain on account of exchange differences on foreign currency loans for operating stations shall be recoverable from / payable to beneficiaries on actual payment basis, as per the said Regulations. Accordingly, such exchange differences are also within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nIn view of the above, exchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/ debit to 'Net Movements in Regulatory deferral account balances' and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of (-) ' 382.42 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2021 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2020: ' 1,202.93 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.)\n\n- (b) Revision of pay scales of employees of PSEs w.e.f. 1 January 2017 has been implemented based on the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE).

The increase in gratuity limit from ' 0.10 crore to ' 0.20 crore falls under the category of 'Change in law' and a regulatory asset has been created. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has since been amended and the ceiling has been increased to ' 0.20 crore.\n\nConsidering the methodology followed by the CERC for allowing impact of the previous pay revision, various tariff orders issued by the CERC under Regulations, 2014 and the above-mentioned provision related to the change in law of CERC Tariff Regulations, 2014, a regulatory asset has been created upto 31 March 2019 (Regulatory deferral account debit balance) towards the increase in O&M expenditure due to the pay revision. This has been taken up with CERC through truing up tariff petition.\n\n- (c) CERC Regulations provide that deferred tax liability upto 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,437.85 crore (31 March 2020: ' 4,000.77 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2021 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n- (d) The petition filed by the Company before CERC for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash, has been favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual additional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016 subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset has been created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there is shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,003.79 crore (31 March 2020: ' 647.56 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2021 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n- (e) CERC Regulations provide that the capital expenditure in respect of existing generating station incurred /projected to be incurred , inter-alia , towards liabilities to meet award of arbitration  (i) within the original scope of work after the COD upto the cut off date (Regulations 24) ; (ii) within the original scope of work and after the cut off date (Regulations 25); and (iii)  beyond the original scope of work (Regulation 26),  will be admitted by CERC subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory deferral account debit balance has been accounted corresponding to  the amount debited to Statement of profit & loss in respect of arbitration cases amounting to ' 110.81 crore for the year ended 31 March 2021 (31 March 2020:Nil).\n\n## (iii) Risks associated with future recovery/reversal of regulatory deferral account balances:\n\n- (i) demand risk due to changes in consumer attitudes, the availability of alternative sources of supply\n- (ii) regulatory risk on account of changes in regulations and submission or approval of a rate-setting application or the entity's assessment of the expected future regulatory actions\n- (iii) other risks including currency or other market risks, if any\n\n## (iv) Reconciliation of the carrying amounts:\n\nThe regulated assets/liability recognized in the books to be recovered from or payable to beneficiaries in future periods are as follows:\n\n- a)  Regulatory deferral account debit balance - Note 19\n\nThe regulatory assets recognized in the books to be recovered from the beneficiaries in future periods are as follows:\n\n'\n\nCrore\n\n| Particulars                                                                                        | For the year  ended   31 March 2021   | For the year  ended   31 March 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| A.

Contract balances\n\nContract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are transferred to unbilled revenue when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from the customers which are referred as 'advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries'.\n\nThe following table provides information about trade receivables, unbilled revenue and advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries:\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                        | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 1 April 2020   | As at 1 April 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                    | Current               | Non-current           | Current              | Non-current          |\n| Trade receivables                                  | 13,701.72             | -                     | 15,615.19            | -                    |\n| Unbilled revenue                                   | 12,304.88             | -                     | 11,025.15            | -                    |\n| Advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries | 1,432.67              | -                     | 652.34               | -                    |\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to change in transaction prices is ' 1,154.64 crore (31 March 2020 : ' 31.59 crore).\n\n## V. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\n\nPerformance obligations related to sale of energy:\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations, where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. Therefore, transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations cannot be determined reliably for the entire duration of the contract.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Practical expedients applied as per Ind AS 115:\n\n- a.   The company has not disclosed information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date.\n- b.   The Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Company has not adjusted any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n- VII. The Company has not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining contracts with a customer and therefore, not recognised an asset for such costs.\n\n## 66.   Disclosure as per Ind AS 116 'Leases'\n\n## (A)   Company as Lessee\n\n- (i)    The Company's significant leasing arrangements are in respect of the following assets:\n- (a)    Premises for residential use of employees, offices and  guest houses/ transit camps on lease which are not noncancellable and are usually renewable on mutually agreeable terms. The company generally incurs amount on improvements which are significant to the respective lease and hence the cancellable period of the lease during which the company intends to continue considering the past experience / practice, is considered for the purpose of determining the lease period.\n- (b)   The Company has taken electrical vehicles on operating lease for a period of six years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. Lease rentals are subject to escalation of 10% per annum.\n- (c)    A helicopter on wet lease basis.\n- (d)  The Company has taken certain vehicles (other than electrical) on lease for a period of four years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. There are no escalations in the lease rentals as per terms of the agreement. However, the Company has purchase option for such vehicles at the end of the lease term.\n- (e)   The Company had entered into an agreement for movement of coal through inland waterways for one of its stations. As per the agreement, the operator was to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the unloading and material handling infrastructure for 7 years after which it was to be transferred to the Company at ' 1/-. Refer Note no. 57 (iii)(b).\n- (f)    The Company acquires land on leasehold basis for a period generally ranging from 25 years to 99 years from the government authorities which can be renewed further based on mutually agreed terms and conditions. The leases are non cancellable. These leases are capitalised at the present value of the total minimum lease payments to be paid over the lease term. Future lease rentals are recognised as 'Lease obligations' at their present values. The Rightof-use land is amortised considering the significant accounting policies of the Company.\n- (ii)  The following are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities recognised and the movements during the year :\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                      | For the year   ended   31 March 2021   | For the year   ended   31 March 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Opening Balance                  | 829.67                                 | 186.41                                 |\n| - Additions in lease liabilities | 36.05                                  | 648.21                                 |\n| - Interest cost during the year  | 49.27                                  | 37.82                                  |\n| - Payment of lease liabilities   | (42.57)                                | (42.77)                                |\n| Closing Balance                  | 872.42                                 | 829.67                                 |\n| Current                          | 151.80                                 | 106.41                                 |\n| Non Current                      | 720.62                                 | 723.26                                 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the Corporate Governance Report, and the information included in the Directors' Report including Annexures, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility Report and other company related information (but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon), which are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions, if required.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements, that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As required by the Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2016 ('the Order') issued by the Central Government of India in terms of Section 143(11) of the Act, and on the basis of such checks of the books and records of the Company as we considered appropriate and according to the information and explanations given to us, we give in 'Annexure 1' a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the said Order, to the extent applicable.\n- 2.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial control with reference to the standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA Company's internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reporting entity\n\nNTPC  Limited  (the  'Company'  or  'Parent  Company')  is  a  Company  domiciled  in  India  and  limited  by  shares  (CIN: L40101DL1975GOI007966). The shares of the Company are listed and traded on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited in India. The address of the Company's registered office is NTPC Bhawan, SCOPE Complex, 7 Institutional Area, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003. These consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (referred to collectively as the 'Group') and the Group's interest in its joint ventures. The Group is primarily involved in the generation and sale of bulk power to State Power Utilities. Other business of the Group includes providing consultancy, project management & supervision, energy trading, oil & gas exploration and coal mining.\n\n## B.  Basis of preparation\n\n## 1. Statement of Compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared on going concern basis following accrual system of accounting and comply with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended, and other relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 to the extent applicable.\n\nThese financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors in its meeting held on 19 June 2021.\n\n## 2. Basis of measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) that are measured at fair value (refer serial no. 28 of accounting policy regarding financial instruments); and\n- \u00b7 Plan assets in the case of employees defined benefit plans that are measured at fair value.\n\nThe methods used to measure fair values are discussed in notes to the financial statements.\n\nHistorical cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire assets at the time of their acquisition or the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation, or at the amounts of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid to satisfy the liability in the normal course of business. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## 3. Functional and presentation currency\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ' ) which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented in ( ' ) has been rounded to the nearest crore (up to two decimals), except when indicated otherwise.\n\n## 4. Current and non-current classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification.\n\nAn asset is classified as current when it is:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\n- \u00b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- \u00b7 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\n\nA liability is classified as current when:\n\n- \u00b7 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Significant accounting policies\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has elected to utilize the option under Ind AS 101 - 'First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards' by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16 - 'Property, plant and equipment' & Ind AS 38 - 'Intangible assets' retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 1 April 2015. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1 April 2015, i.e. the Group's date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on transition to Ind AS.\n\n## 1. Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiary companies and joint venture companies are drawn up to the same reporting date as of the Company for the purpose of consolidation.\n\n## 1.1  Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the investee. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Group and are continued to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nThe Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with Group's accounting policies.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet respectively.\n\nChanges in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in statement of profit and loss. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities of the subsidiary i.e. reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred to equity as specified by applicable Ind AS. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.\n\n## 1.2  Joint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group investment in joint venture, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Losses recognized using the equity method in excess of the entity's investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the entity's interest in an associate or a joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority i.e. priority in liquidation.\n\nThe statement of profit and loss reflects the Group' share of results of operations of the joint venture. Any change in the OCI of those investee is presented as presented as part of the Group OCI. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted as investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in D.11 below.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to apply equity method of accounting for an investment because of a loss of joint control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in statement of profit and loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n## 2. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## 2.1. Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the present value of initial estimate of cost of dismantling, removal and restoration.\n\nSubsequent  measurement  is  done  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation/amortization  and  accumulated impairment losses.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.\n\nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.\n\nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, capitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.\n\nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering estimates/assessments.\n\nItems of spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.\n\nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly increasing\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2.2. Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nExpenditure on major inspection and overhauls of generating unit is capitalized, when it meets the asset recognition criteria. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection and overhaul is derecognized.\n\nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group uses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n\n## 2.3. Decommissioning costs\n\nThe present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\n\n## 2.4. De-recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn circumstance, where an item of property, plant and equipment is abandoned, the net carrying cost relating to the property, plant and equipment is written off in the same period.\n\n## 2.5. Depreciation/amortization\n\nDepreciation is recognized in statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Group, covered under Part B of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight-line method following the rates and methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the oil & gas exploration and consultancy business is charged on straight-line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.\n\nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:\n\n| a) Kutcha roads                                                                                                                                                            | 2 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| b) Enabling works                                                                                                                                                          |           |\n| - residential buildings                                                                                                                                                    | 15 years  |\n| - internal electrification of residential buildings                                                                                                                        | 10 years  |\n| - non-residential buildings including their internal electrification, water supply, sewerage &         drainage works, railway sidings, aerodromes, helipads and airstrips | 5 years   |\n| c) Personal computers & laptops including peripherals                                                                                                                      | 3 years   |\n| d) Photocopiers, fax machines, water coolers and refrigerators                                                                                                             | 5 years   |\n| e) Temporary erections including wooden structures                                                                                                                         | 1 year    |\n| f) Telephone exchange                                                                                                                                                      | 15 years  |\n| g) Wireless systems, VSAT equipment, display devices viz. projectors, screens, CCTV, audio video       conferencing systems and other communication equipment              | 6 years   |\n| h) Energy saving electrical appliances and fittings                                                                                                                        | 2-7 years |\n| i) Solar/wind power plants which are not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations                                                                                               | 25 years  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized is net of value of coal extracted during development phase.\n\nDate of commercial operation of integrated coal mines shall be determined on the occurring of earliest of following milestones as provided in CERC tariff regulations:\n\n- 1) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25% of the peak rated capacity as per the mining plan is achieved; or\n- 2) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production exceeds the total expenditure in that year; or\n- 3) The date of two years from the date of commencement of production;\n\nOn the date of commercial operation, the assets under capital work-in-progress are classified as a component of property, plant and equipment under 'Mining property'.\n\nGains and losses on de-recognition of assets referred above, are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 7.1. Stripping activity expense/adjustment\n\nExpenditure incurred on removal of mine waste materials (overburden) necessary to extract the coal reserves is referred to as stripping cost. The Group has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine as technically estimated.\n\nCost of stripping is charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to revenue.\n\nNet of the balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as 'Stripping activity adjustment' under the head 'Non-current assets/Non-current provisions' as the case may be, and adjusted as provided in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 7.2. Mines closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nThe Group's obligations for land reclamation and decommissioning of structure consist of spending at mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Group estimates its obligations for mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning based on the detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of future cash spending for the required work and provided for as per approved mine closure plan. The estimate of expenses is escalated for inflation and then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risk, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of expenditure required to settle the obligation. The Group recognizes a corresponding asset under property, plant and equipment as a separate item for the cost associated with such obligation.\n\nThe value of the obligation is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds and the same is recognized as finance costs.\n\nFurther, a specific escrow account is maintained for this purpose as per approved mine closure plan. The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis, forming part of the total mine closure obligation, are initially recognized as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn from escrow account after concurrence of the certifying agency.\n\n## 8.

Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' (b) interest expense on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with Ind AS 116- 'Leases' and(c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.\n\nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use are complete.\n\nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## 10. Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates, trade discounts and other similar items. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, surplus and non-moving items of stores and spares is ascertained on review and provided for.\n\nSteel scrap is valued at estimated realizable value.\n\n## 11. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 12. Government  grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.\n\n## 13. Fly ash utilization reserve fund\n\nProceeds from sale of ash/ash products along-with income on investment of surplus fund are transferred to 'Fly ash utilization reserve fund' in terms of provisions of gazette notification dated 3 November 2009 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The fund is utilized towards expenditure on development of infrastructure/ facilities, promotion & facilitation activities for use of fly ash.\n\n## 14. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If\n\n<!-- image -->",

When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.\n\n## 15. Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it arises with the exception that exchange differences on long term monetary items related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment recognized up to 31 March 2016 are adjusted to the carrying cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. In case of advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency, the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it), is when the Group initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities are recognized in OCI. The associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal of the net investment.\n\n## 16. Revenue\n\nGroup's revenues arise from sale and trading of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, income on assets under lease, supply of coal from integrated coal mines and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, employees, contractors etc., dividend from mutual fund investments, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.\n\n## 16.1. Revenue from sale of energy\n\nThe majority of the Group's operations in India are regulated under the Electricity Act, 2003. Accordingly, the CERC determines the tariff for the Group's power plants based on the norms prescribed in the tariff regulations as applicable from time to time. Tariff is based on the capital cost incurred for a specific power plant and primarily comprises two\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tariff for Group's integrated coal mines are also determined by CERC based on the norms prescribed in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the products or services and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when (or as) control over the products or services is transferred to a customer.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.\n\nThe incentives/disincentives are accounted for based on the norms notified/approved by the CERC as per principles enunciated in Ind AS 115 - 'Revenue from contracts with customers'. In cases of power stations where the same have not been notified/approved, incentives/disincentives are accounted for on provisional basis.\n\nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power exchanges.\n\nExchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary items denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Regulatory deferred account balances' and such balances are adjusted in the year in which the same becomes recoverable/payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nExchange differences on account of translation of foreign currency borrowings recognized up to 31 March 2016, to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Deferred foreign currency fluctuation asset' with corresponding credit to 'Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation'. Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation account is amortized in the proportion in which depreciation is charged on such exchange differences and same is adjusted against depreciation expense. Fair value changes in respect of forward exchange contracts for derivatives recoverable from/payable to the beneficiaries as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, are recognized in sales.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy through trading is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.\n\nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.\n\n## 16.2. Revenue from services\n\nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.\n\nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.\n\nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.\n\n## 16.3. Other income\n\nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For credit impaired financial assets the EIR is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance). EIR is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash receipts\n\n<!-- image -->",

For purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortized cost of the POCI assets.\n\nScrap other than steel scrap is accounted for as and when sold.\n\nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.\n\nRevenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nFor debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recorded using the EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the EIR, the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.\n\nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever there is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on receipt/ acceptance.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.\n\n## 17. Employee  benefits\n\n## 17.1. Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefits expense in statement of profit and loss in the period during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due after more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution pension scheme which is administered through a separate trust. The obligation of the Group is to contribute to the trust to the extent of amount not exceeding 30% of basic pay and dearness allowance less employer's contribution towards provident fund, gratuity, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF) or any other retirement benefits. The Group's contribution towards pension is made to National Pension Trust (NPS) for the employees opted for the scheme. The contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme of the Company/NPS for the year are recognized as an expense and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 17.2. Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's liability towards gratuity, pension scheme at two of the stations in respect of taken over employees from the erstwhile state government power utility, post-retirement medical facility(PRMF), baggage allowance for settlement at home town after retirement, farewell gift on retirement and provident fund scheme to the extent of interest liability on provident fund contribution are in the nature of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Group pays fixed contribution to the provident fund at predetermined rates to a separate trust, which invests the funds in permitted securities. The contributions to the fund for the year are recognized as expense and are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The obligation of the Group is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India.\n\nThe gratuity is funded by the Group and is managed by separate trust. The Group has PRMF, under which retired employee and the spouse are provided medical facilities in the Group hospitals/empaneled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Group.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the",

The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Remeasurement comprising of actuarial gain and losses, return on plan assets (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) & effect of asset ceiling (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) and the same are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they arise.\n\nPast service costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognizes related restructuring costs. If a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used for the re-measurement.\n\n## 17.3. Other long-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits under the Group's leave encashment, long-service award and economic rehabilitation scheme constitute other long term employee benefits.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of these long-term employee benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Remeasurement comprising of actuarial gain and losses, return on plan assets (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) & effect of asset ceiling (excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability) and the same are recognized in statement of profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.\n\nThe obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.\n\n## 17.4. Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\nA liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under performance related pay if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## 18. Other  expenses\n\nExpenses on ex-gratia payments under voluntary retirement scheme, training & recruitment and voluntary community development are charged to statement of profit and loss in the year incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research is charged to revenue as and when incurred. Expenditure on development is charged to revenue as and when incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for intangible asset as per Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets'.\n\nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno economic clearance are charged to statement of profit and loss.\n\nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.\n\nTransit and handling losses of coal as per Group's norms are included in cost of coal.\n\n## 19. Income  tax\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient taxable profits will be available in future to allow all or part of deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint venture where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are not recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries and interest in joint arrangements where it is not probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized.\n\nAdditional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognized at the same time that the liability to pay the related dividend is recognized. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the Group originally recognized those past transactions or events.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability. MAT credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which MAT credit can be utilized.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognized. The effect of the uncertainty is recognized using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Group evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## 20. Leases\n\n## 20.1. As lessee\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities.",

Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/ amortized from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\n\n## 20.2. As lessor\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the customer the right to control the use of the underlying asset. Arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to customers/ suppliers to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments are identified as either finance leases or operating leases.\n\n## Accounting for finance leases\n\nWhere the Group determines a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be or to contain a lease and where the off taker has the principal risk and rewards of ownership of the power plant through its contractual arrangements with the Group, the arrangement is considered a finance lease. Capacity payments are apportioned between capital repayments relating to the provision of the plant, finance income and service income. The finance income element of the capacity payment is recognized as revenue, using a rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in each period. The service income element of the capacity payment is the difference between the total capacity payment and the amount recognized as finance income and capital repayments and recognized as revenue as it is earned.\n\nThe amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as financial assets, classified as 'Finance lease receivables', at the amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for operating leases\n\nWhere the Group determines a long term PPA to be or to contain a lease and where the Group retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement is considered an operating lease.\n\nFor operating leases, the power plant is capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its economic life. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 21. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - 'Impairment of Assets'. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 'cash-generating unit', or 'CGU').\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to\n\n<!-- image -->",

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## 22. Operating  segments\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 108 - 'Operating segments', the operating segments used to present segment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group's management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Group's 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' or 'CODM' within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, finance costs, income tax expenses and corporate income that are not directly attributable to segments.\n\nRevenue directly attributable to the segments is considered as segment revenue. Expenses directly attributable to the segments and common expenses allocated on a reasonable basis are considered as segment expenses.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress, intangible assets other than goodwill and intangible assets under development.\n\nSegment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, capital work in progress, intangible assets under development, advances for capital expenditures, trade and other receivables, inventories and other assets that can be directly or reasonably allocated to segments. For the purpose of segment reporting, property, plant and equipment have been allocated to segments based on the extent of usage of assets for operations attributable to the respective segments. Unallocated assets comprise investments, income tax assets, corporate assets and other assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\nSegment liabilities include all operating liabilities in respect of a segment and consist principally of trade payable, payable for capital expenditure and other payables, provision for employee benefits and other provisions. Unallocated liabilities comprise equity, income tax liabilities, loans and borrowings and other liabilities and provisions that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\n## 23. Business  Combinations\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree and fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair values on their acquisition date (except certain assets and liabilities which are required to be measured as per the applicable standard) and the non-controlling interest is initially recognized at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets.\n\nAcquisition related costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquired entity and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognized. Where the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquired entity and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognized as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\nBusiness combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in statement of profit and loss or OCI, as appropriate. When the Group obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, then it considers such an acquisition as a business combination achieved in stages.\n\n## 24. Dividends\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.",

Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per equity share are also computed using the earnings amounts excluding the movements in regulatory deferral account balances.\n\n## 27. Statement of cash flows\n\nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7 - 'Statement of cash flows'.\n\n## 28. Financial  instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## 28.1. Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nA 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a)   The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- (b)   Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTOCI (Fair value through OCI)\n\nA 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n\n- (a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- (b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI\n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Group recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\n\nIn addition, the Group may elect to classify a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Interest income on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## Investment in Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments in entities other than subsidiaries and joint venture companies are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on sale/disposal of investments. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on sale / disposal of the investments.\n\nEquity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Group's balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except for equity instruments classified as at FVTOCI, where such differences are recorded in OCI.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments', the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:\n\n- (a)  Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits and bank balance.\n- (b)  Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI.\n- (c) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.\n- (d)  Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.\n- (e)  Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n- (f) Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Group applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments', which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial recognition.\n\nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets), the Group determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the Group reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\n## Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.3. Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## 28.4. Derivative financial instruments\n\nInitial recognition and subsequent measurement\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks of foreign currency loans. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.5. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## 29. Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.\n\nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less cost to sell.\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n\n## D.  Use of estimates and management judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:\n\n## 1. Formulation of accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.\n\n## 2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\nUseful life of the assets of the generation of electricity business and integrated coal mines (where tariff is regulated) is determined by the CERC Tariff Regulations in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## 3. Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 4. Defined benefit plans and long-term employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of salary increases and the inflation rate. The Group considers that the assumptions used to measure its obligations are appropriate and documented. However, any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the resulting calculations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenues\n\nThe Group records revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 6. Leases not in legal form of lease\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.\n\n## 7. Assets held for sale\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply the accounting of non-current assets held for sale under Ind AS 105 - 'Noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. In assessing the applicability, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the availability of the asset for immediate sale, management's commitment for the sale and probability of sale within one year to conclude if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\n## 8. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nRecognition of regulatory deferral account balances involves significant judgments including about future tariff regulations since these are based on estimation of the amounts expected to be recoverable/payable through tariff in future.\n\n## 9. Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37 - 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'. The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.\n\n## 10.  Classification of joint arrangements\n\nGroup's joint arrangements in the nature of joint operations and joint ventures require unanimous consent from all parties sharing control for decisions about the relevant activities. Parties are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred by the joint arrangements. These arrangements are classified and accounted for as either joint operation or joint venture in accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 111 - 'Joint Arrangements'.\n\n## 11.  Impairment test of investments in Joint Venture Companies\n\nThe recoverable amount of investment in joint venture companies is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Company. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 12.  Income taxes\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the event the Hon'ble High Court grants relief to the Company, the amount would be adjusted against Current liabilities - Provisions - Provision for others (Note 35). Management expects that the total cost incurred, anticipated expenditure on the safety and stabilisation measures, other recurring site expenses and interest costs as well as claims of  contractors/vendors for various packages for this project will be compensated in full by the GOI. Hence, no provision is considered necessary.\n- b)     The Company had ascertained that the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) entered into for Stage-I of a power station with the beneficiary falls under the definition of finance lease. Accordingly, the written down value of the specified assets was derecognized from PPE and accounted as Finance Lease Receivable (FLR) on transition to Ind AS. The Company has continued to classify this arrangement with its customer as lease based on the practical expedient provided in  Ind AS 116. Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation, interest on loan capital & return on equity (pretax) components from the beneficiary are continued to be adjusted against FLR. The interest component of the FLR and amount received on account of revision of tariff of previous periods in respect of the above three elements are continued to be recognised as 'Interest income on Assets under finance lease' under 'Revenue from operations' (Note 38).\n- c) As per the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India for preparation of Mine Closure Plan, Escrow Accounts have been opened for each captive mine and the balances held in these escrow accounts are presented as 'Mine closure deposit'. Up to 80% of the total deposited amount including interest accrued in the escrow account shall be released after every five years in line with the periodic examination of the closure plan as per the Guidelines. Interest earned on the escrow account is added to mine closure deposit account.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount will be adjusted with the cost of related work or recovered from the party, depending upon the outcome of the arbitration proceedings.\n- d)   Advances to contractors and suppliers include payments to Railways amounting to ' 1,963.25 crore (31 March 2020: ' 2,063.56 crore) under customer funding model as per policy on 'Participative model for rail-connectivity and capacity augmentation projects' issued by the Ministry of Railways, GOI. As per this policy, an agreement has been signed between the Company and the Ministry of Railways, GOI on 6 June 2016. As per the agreement, railway projects agreed between the Company and Railways will be constructed, maintained and operated by Railways and ownership of the line and its operations and maintenance will always remain with them. Railways will pay upto 7% of the amount invested through freight rebate on freight volumes every year till the funds provided by the Company are fully recovered along-with interest (equal to the prevailing rate of dividend payable by Railways at the time of signing of respective agreements), subject to the rebate not exceeding the freight amount in the accounting year, after commercial operation date (COD) of the railway projects. The advance is adjusted at projects which have achieved COD based on confirmation from Railways towards freight rebate in consonance with the agreement terms and the interest portion is recognised in Note-39-'Other income'.\n- e)    Secured capital advances are secured against the hypothecation of the construction equipment/material supplied by the contractors/suppliers.\n- f) Loans given to employees are measured at amortized cost. The deferred payroll expenditure represents the benefits on account of interest rate on loans being lower than the market rate of interest. The same is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the loan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

C.5 (Note 1). Refer Note 69 for detailed disclosures.\n- b) CERC Tariff Regulations, 2019 provide for recovery of deferred tax liability (DTL) as at 31 March 2009 from the beneficiaries. Accordingly, DTL as at 31 March 2009 is recoverable on materialisation from the beneficiaries. Regulations, 2014 and Regulations, 2019 provide for grossing-up the rate of return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. Accordingly, deferred tax liability for the period from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related DTL forms part of current tax. Keeping in view the above, the Group has recognized such deferred tax as regulatory deferral account debit balances, since the amounts are recoverable in future years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Though this amount is not repayable to the beneficiaries, keeping in view the matching principle, and in line with the opinion of the Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), this was treated as deferred revenue to the extent depreciation chargeable in the accounts is considered to be higher than the depreciation recoverable in tariff in future years. Since AAD is in the nature of deferred revenue and does not constitute a liability, it has been disclosed in this note separately from equity and liabilities.\n- b) Foreign exchange rate variation (FERV) on foreign currency loans and interest thereon is recoverable from/payable to the customers in line with the Tariff Regulations. Keeping in view the opinion of the EAC of ICAI, the Company is recognizing deferred foreign currency fluctuation asset by corresponding credit to deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation in respect of the FERV on foreign currency loans adjusted in the cost of property, plant and equipment, which is recoverable from the customers in future years as provided in accounting policy no. C.16 (Note 1). This amount will be recognized as revenue corresponding to the depreciation charge in future years. The amount does not constitute a liability to be discharged in future periods and hence, it has been disclosed separately from equity and liabilities.\n\n## 38.

A further appropriation of 15% of BG amount i.e. ' 35.64 crore has been done by MoC in December 2020 for not complying with some more efficiency parameters as specified in the allotment agreement. The subsidiary company has decided to exercise remedies available in the allotment agreement both for revision of efficiency parameters (milestones) and refund of appropriated value of the bank guarantee and accordingly approached MoC which inter alia includes referring the matter to appropriate tribunal for redressal.\n- 50. (a)   The environmental clearance ('clearance') granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India (MoEF) for one of the Company's project consisting of three units of 800 MW each, was challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT disposed off the appeal, inter alia, directing that the order of clearance be remanded to the MoEF to pass an order granting or declining clearance to the project proponent afresh in accordance with the law and the judgement of the NGT and for referring the matter to the Expert Appraisal Committee ('Committee') for its re-scrutiny, which shall complete the process within six months from the date of NGT order. NGT also directed that the environmental clearance shall be kept in abeyance and the Company shall maintain status quo in relation to the project during the period of review by the Committee or till fresh order is passed by the MoEF, whichever is earlier. The Company filed an appeal challenging the NGT order before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India which stayed the order of the NGT and the matter is sub-judice. All the units of the project have been declared commercial in the earlier years. The carrying cost of the project as at 31 March 2021 is ' 15,115.02 crore (31 March 2020: ' 15,662.28 crore). Management is confident that the approval for the project shall be granted,  hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n- (b)   The Company is executing a thermal power project consisting of two units of 800 MW each in the State of Telangana. The project construction commenced in the year 2016 after obtaining the requisite approval and Environment Clearance (EC) from MOEF&CC. On 27 May 2021, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed an order instructing MOEF&CC to keep the EC granted for the project in abeyance for a period of seven months or till the period the re-appraisal is done and additional conditions imposed by the MOEF&CC, whichever is earlier. NGT has further directed the  MOEF&CC to conduct additional studies pertaining to Environment Impact Assessment of the project, to be carried out through the company, for  further assessment  by its Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and  get recommendations of the EAC for imposing additional conditions by the MOEF&CC, if any, on the company for allowing the units to operate. The Company has obtained advice of prominent legal experts and has filed an appeal before Hon'ble Supreme Court of India against the directions of NGT.  Both the units of the project are in advanced stage of construction and commissioning of the units is envisaged in the next year. The carrying cost of the project as at 31 March 2021 is ' 9,376.31 crore (31 March 2020: ' 8,017.48 crore). Management is confident that the approval for the continuation of the project shall be granted, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As per Para 64 of Ind AS 19, in case of surplus in a defined benefit plan, an entity shall measure the net defined benefit asset at the lower of actual surplus or the value of the assets ceiling determined using the discount rate. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Further, paragraph 65 provides that a net defined benefit asset may arise where a defined benefit plan has been overfunded or where actuarial gains have arisen.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Group has no right to the benefits either in the form of refund from the plan or lower future contribution to the plan towards the net surplus of ' 94.61 crore (31 March 2020: ' 71.32 crore) determined through actuarial valuation. Accordingly, Group has not recognised the surplus as an asset, and the actuarial gains in 'Other Comprehensive Income', as these pertain to the Provident Fund Trust and not to the Group.\n\n## B. Gratuity and pension\n\n- a) The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has rendered continuous service of five years or more is entitled to gratuity at 15 days salary (15/26 X last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance) for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ' 0.20 crore on superannuation, resignation, termination, disablement or on death, considering the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act,1972, as amended.\n- b)  The Group has pension schemes at two of its stations in respect of employees taken over from erstwhile state government power utilities. These pension schemes are unfunded. The liability for the pension schemes is recognised on the basis of actuarial valuation.\n\nBased on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the status of the gratuity and pension plan and the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements as at balance sheet date:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                             | As  at    31 March 2021   | As  at    31 March 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Net defined benefit (asset)/liability : |                           |                           |\n| Gratuity (funded)                       | 128.12                    | 177.44                    |\n| Gratuity (non-funded)                   | 190.35                    | 191.21                    |\n| Pension (funded)                        | -                         | -                         |\n| Pension (non-funded)                    | 569.36                    | 591.83                    |\n|                                         | 887.83                    | 960.48                    |\n| Non-current                             | 706.24                    | 727.49                    |\n| Current                                 | 181.59                    | 232.99                    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2020   | As at 31 March 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                          | Increase              | Decrease              | Increase              | Decrease              |\n| Discount rate (0.5% movement)            | (190.73)              | 200.32                | (431.29)              | 461.89                |\n| Annual increase in costs (0.5% movement) | 90.61                 | (78.32)               | 153.19                | (147.47)              |\n| Salary escalation rate (0.5% movement)   | 99.50                 | (94.54)               | 298.00                | (290.07)              |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## G. Risk exposure\n\nThrough its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\n## a)    Asset volatility\n\nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Most of the plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level. A portion of the funds are invested in equity securities and in alternative investments which have low correlation with equity securities. The equity securities are expected to earn a return in excess of the discount rate and contribute to the plan deficit. The Group has a risk management strategy where the aggregate amount of risk exposure on a portfolio level is maintained at a fixed range. Any deviations from the range are corrected by rebalancing the portfolio. The Group intends to maintain the above investment mix in the continuing years.\n\n## b)    Changes in discount rate\n\nA decrease in discount rate will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings.\n\n## c)    Inflation risks\n\nIn the pension plans, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## d)    Life expectancy\n\nThe pension plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within this framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.\n\nThe Group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Group uses derivatives to manage some of its risk. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.\n\nA large portion of assets consists of government and corporate bonds. The plan asset mix is in compliance with the requirements of the respective local regulations.\n\n## H.

As per order of Hon'ble High Court, formal handing over of the infrastructure started on 20 January 2020 at the project site. However, due to certain local administrative issues initially and further due to Covid-19 pandemic, Local Commissioner's visit had to be deferred.\n\nIn view of delay in the handover exercise, NTPC had filed an Application in Hon'ble High Court  praying to pass further directions to operator in this regard. Hon'ble High Court on 11 November 2020  disposed off the application requesting  the Ld. Local Commissioner appointed by the Court, to visit the project site expeditiously preferably within 2 weeks and carry out the commission.  The  handing over exercise has been delayed due to operator's issues with local labours at the site and Covid situation.

The Group has taken adequate measures to address such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices.\n\nIn order to institutionalize the risk management in the Group, an elaborate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework has been developed. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the parent company's risk management framework. As a part of the implementation of ERM framework, a 'Risk Management Committee (RMC)' with functional directors as its members has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks, formulate action plans and strategies to mitigate risks on short-term as well as long-term basis.\n\nThe RMC meets every quarter to deliberate on strategies.

Outcomes of RMC are submitted for information of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises principally from trade receivables, unbilled revenue, loans, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\n## Trade receivables & unbilled revenue\n\nThe Group primarily sells electricity to bulk customers comprising mainly state utilities owned by State Governments. The Company has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC) backed by the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA). The TPAs were signed among the Govt. of India, RBI and the individual State Governments subsequent to the issuance of the One Time Settlement Scheme of SEBs dues during 2001-02 by the GOI, which were valid till October 2016. Govt of India subsequently approved the extension of these TPAs for another period of 10 years. Most of the States have signed these extended TPAs and signing is in progress for the balance states.\n\nCERC Tariff Regulations allow payment against monthly bill towards energy charges within a period of forty five days from the date of bill and levy of surcharge @ 18% p.a. on delayed payment beyond forty five days. On 22 February 2021, Ministry of power has issued a notification and accordingly Late Payment Surcharge (LPSC) shall be payable on the payment outstanding after the due date at the base rate of LPSC applicable for the period for the first month of default and the rate of LPSC for the successive months of default shall increase by 0.5 percent for every month of delay provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The TPA also provided that if there is any default in payment of current dues by any State Utility the outstanding dues can be deducted from the State's RBI account and paid to the concerned CPSU. There is also provision of regulation of power by the Group in case of non payment of dues and non-establishment of LC.\n\nIn addition to above, MoP vide its communications dated 28 June 2019 and  subsequent clarifications, further emphasised on ensuring availability of suitable payment security mechanism to be maintained by DISCOMs. Further, to liquidate the outstanding dues of the discoms towards the generating companies, GOI has announced a Scheme for offering ' 90,000 crore in soft loans under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package. The Discoms are expected to take the benefit of the this Scheme and pay their outstanding dues.\n\nThese payment security mechanisms have served the Group well over the years. The Group has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of trade receivables in the past years. Since the Group has its power stations as well as customers spread over various states of India, geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.\n\nUnbilled revenue primarily relates to the Group's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same type of contracts.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in only Government of India Securities, State Government Securities and other counterparties have a high credit rating. The management actively monitors the interest rate and maturity period of these investments. The Group does not expect the counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, and has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of any of the investments.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe Group has given loans to employees, joint venture companies and other parties. Loans to the employee are secured against the mortgage of the house properties and hypothecation of vehicles for which such loans have been given in line with the policies of the Company. The loan provided to group companies are collectible in full and risk of default is negligible. Loan to APIIC is against a guarantee given by the Government of Andhra Pradesh vide GO dated 3 April 2003.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Group held cash and cash equivalents of ' 950.02 crore (31 March 2020: ' 589.52 crore). The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks with high rating.\n\n## Deposits with banks and financial institutions\n\nThe Group held deposits with banks and financial institutions of ' 3,437.78 crore (31 March 2020: ' 2,624.77 crore). In order to manage the risk, Group places deposits with only high rated banks/institutions.\n\n## (i) Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Accordingly, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised.\n\n- (b)  Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using life time expected credit losses as per simplified approach\n\nThe Group has customers (State government utilities) with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible or nil. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. Hence, no impairment loss has been recognised during the reporting periods in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## (iii) Ageing analysis of trade receivables\n\nThe ageing analysis of the trade receivables is as below:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Ageing                                     | Not due   | 0-30 days  past due   | 31-60 days  past due   | 61-90 days  past due   |   91-120  days past  due | More than  120 days  past due   | Total     |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|\n| Gross carrying amount  as at 31 March 2021 | 6,540.16  | 2,515.69              | 1,664.11               | 762.24                 |                   596.07 | 6,186.64                        | 18,264.91 |\n| Gross carrying amount  as at 31 March 2020 | 5,064.29  | 3,330.47              | 2,064.59               | 1,221.85               |                   663.58 | 8,158.38                        | 20,503.16 |\n\n- (iv)  Reconciliation of impairment loss provisions\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of financial assets during the year was as follows:\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                                        | Trade  receivables   | Advances   | Claims  recoverable   | Total    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Balance as at 1 April 2019                                         | 148.53               | 0.14       | 15.07                 | 163.74   |\n| Impairment loss recognised                                         | 88.18                | -          | -                     | 88.18    |\n| Amounts written off                                                | 48.14                | -          | 14.95                 | 63.09    |\n| Balance as at 31 March 2020                                        | 188.57               | 0.14       | 0.12                  | 188.83   |\n| Impairment loss recognised                                         | -                    | -          | 343.51                | 343.51   |\n| Amounts written off / written back / adjustment  during the period | (358.27)             | 0.03       | 0.01                  | (358.23) |\n| Balance as at 31 March 2021                                        | 546.84               | 0.11       | 343.62                | 890.57   |\n\nBased on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of any other financial assets as the amounts of such allowances are not significant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group has an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group's treasury department is responsible for managing the short term and long term liquidity requirements of the Group. Short term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by Treasury department. The Board of directors has established policies to manage liquidity risk and the Group's treasury department operates in line with such policies. Any breaches of these policies are reported to the Board of Directors. Long term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board of Directors and appropriate decisions are taken according to the situation.\n\nTypically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a month, including the servicing of financial obligations, this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.\n\nAs part of the CERC regulations, tariff inter alia includes recovery of capital cost. The tariff regulations also provide for recovery of energy charges, operations and maintenance expenses and interest on normative working capital requirements. Since billing to the customers are generally on a monthly basis, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to service financial obligations and to meet its operational requirements.\n\n## (i) Financing arrangements\n\nThe Group had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars              | 31 March 2021   | 31 March 2020   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Fixed-rate borrowings    |                 |                 |\n| Term loans               | -               | 150.00          |\n| Floating-rate borrowings |                 |                 |\n| Cash credit              | 5,230.17        | 3,598.32        |\n| Term loans               | 18,907.83       | 23,140.70       |\n| Foreign currency loans   | 7,534.04        | 7,061.70        |\n| Total                    | 31,672.04       | 33,950.72       |\n\n## (ii)   Maturities of financial liabilities\n\nThe following are the contractual maturities of derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities, based on contractual cash flows:\n\n## 31 March 2021\n\n' Crore\n\n| Contractual maturities of financial   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   | Contractual cash flows   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| liabilities                           | 3 months or  less        | 3-12  months             | 1-2 years                | 2-5 years                | More than  5 years       | Total                    |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities  |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Secured bonds                         | 830.71                   | 2,216.01                 | 6,703.37                 | 14,902.47                | 24,430.95                | 49,083.51                |\n| Unsecured bonds                       | 274.73                   | 170.57                   | -                        | 8,374.10                 | 3,500.00                 | 12,319.40                |\n| Rupee term loans from banks           | 838.74                   | 4,388.13                 | 4,760.92                 | 18,545.36                | 45,468.37                | 74,001.52                |\n| Rupee term loans from others          | 190.71                   | 821.32                   | 885.58                   | 2,450.81                 | 10,213.60                | 14,562.02                |\n| Lease obligations                     | 143.40                   | 57.96                    | 74.00                    | 175.18                   | 2,237.38                 | 2,687.92                 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nThe Board of directors is responsible for setting up of policies and procedures to manage market risks of the Group. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the risk management committee.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain transactions that are denominated in a currency other than entity's functional currency, hence exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.\n\nThe currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 are as below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has examined the applicability of provisions of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' for accounting of embedded derivatives in such contracts considering the opinion of the Expert Advisory Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India in this regard.\n\nThe Group has awarded the above contracts without any intention to enter into any derivative contract or to leverage/take position and without any option/intention to net settle at any point of time during the tenure of the contract. Such contracts, which normally have a tenure ranging from three to ten years, consist of numerous items having varied dates of delivery and payment schedule. Further, forward exchange rates are not realistically available for such longer periods. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that separately recognising the foreign currency derivative embedded in such contracts is impracticable. Moreover, the option available under Ind AS 109 to designate the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss is also not considered practical in the absence of a reliable valuation model.\n\nFurther, the Group is mainly a rate regulated entity whose tariffs are determined by CERC using a cost plus methodology for which, the actual costs incurred on account of property, plant and equipment is considered for determining the capital base for fixation of tariff. Moreover, the impact on the financial statements will not be material  having regard to outstanding contracts as at the year end and also the fact that the Group is mainly in the regulatory environment for which the provisions of  Ind AS 114-'Regulatory deferral accounts' are applicable. Hence, the Group has continued to account for such contracts without separately recognising the foreign currency derivative embedded therein.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising mainly from non-current borrowings with floating interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The Group manages the interest rate risks by entering into different kinds of loan arrangements with varied terms (e.g. fixed rate loans, floating rate loans, rupee term loans, foreign currency loans, etc.).\n\nAt the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n\n| Particulars                      | 31 March 2021   | 31 March 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Financial Assets:                |                 |                 |\n| Fixed-rate instruments           |                 |                 |\n| Loan to related parties          | 20.52           | 19.72           |\n| Loans to others                  | 23.36           | 24.26           |\n| Bank deposits                    | 3,641.60        | 2,695.11        |\n| Total                            | 3,685.48        | 2,739.09        |\n| Financial Liabilities:           |                 |                 |\n| Fixed-rate instruments           |                 |                 |\n| Bonds                            | 61,463.93       | 49,583.55       |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes*    | 33,138.86       | 35,419.45       |\n| Rupee term loans                 | 375.86          | 410.49          |\n| Commercial paper                 | 12,859.74       | 13,819.32       |\n| Lease obligations                | 897.49          | 855.61          |\n| Total (A)                        | 1,08,735.88     | 1,00,088.42     |\n| Variable-rate instruments        |                 |                 |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes     | 13,922.12       | 11,026.44       |\n| Rupee term loans                 | 86,688.29       | 88,843.06       |\n| Cash credit and short term loans | 3,104.88        | 2,736.91        |\n| Total (B)                        | 103,715.29      | 102,606.41      |\n| Total (A+B)                      | 2,12,451.17     | 2,02,694.83     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments\n\nA change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

This includes a valuation team that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements and reports directly to the Director (Finance). The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Significant valuation issues are reported to the audit committee.\n\nFair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investments in quoted equity instruments. Quoted equity instruments are valued using quoted prices on national stock exchange.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. This level includes mutual funds which are valued using the closing NAV.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities included in Level 3 is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from prevailing market transactions and dealer quotes of similar instruments.\n\nThere have been no transfers in either direction for the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.\n\n## (c)  Valuation technique used to determine fair value:\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to fair value of financial instruments include:\n\n- i) For financial instruments other than at ii), iii) and iv) - the use of quoted market prices.\n- ii) For investments in mutual funds - Closing NAV is used.\n- iii)  For financial liabilities (vendor liabilities, debentures/bonds, foreign currency notes, domestic/foreign currency loans): Discounted cash flow; appropriate market borrowing rate of the entity as of each balance sheet date used for  discounting.\n- iv)   For financial assets (employee loans) - Discounted cash flow; appropriate market rate (SBI lending rate) as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n\n## (d)  Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                           | Level   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2020   | As at 31 March 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                       |         | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            |\n| Financial assets                                      |         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans                                                 | 3       | 814.10                | 822.00                | 763.75                | 774.18                |\n| Finance lease receivables                             | 3       | 437.77                | 437.77                | 464.37                | 464.37                |\n| Claims recoverable                                    | 3       | 742.10                | 742.10                | 821.55                | 821.55                |\n| Trade receivables                                     | 3       | 17,718.07             | 17,718.07             | 20,314.59             | 20,314.59             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                             | 1       | 950.02                | 950.02                | 589.52                | 589.52                |\n| Bank balances other than cash and cash    equivalents | 1       | 3,437.78              | 3,437.78              | 2,624.77              | 2,624.77              |\n| Other financial assets                                | 3       | 14,904.23             | 14,904.23             | 13,001.52             | 13,001.52             |\n|                                                       |         | 39,004.07             | 39,011.97             | 38,580.07             | 38,590.50             |\n| Financial liabilities                                 |         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Bonds/Debentures                                      | 1       | 7,701.05              | 8,103.59              | 8,898.25              | 9,920.36              |\n|                                                       | 2       | 33,640.24             | 37,817.73             | 204.60                | 248.22                |\n|                                                       | 3       | 20,122.64             | 22,609.68             | 40,480.70             | 44,641.00             |\n| Foreign currency notes                                | 2       | 20,334.80             | 21,780.49             | 21,755.39             | 21,700.87             |\n|                                                       | 3       | 8,308.56              | 8,933.60              | 8,440.39              | 9,070.10              |\n| Foreign currency loans                                | 3       | 18,417.64             | 18,734.07             | 16,540.32             | 16,875.39             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosure as per Ind AS 114, 'Regulatory Deferral Accounts'\n\n## (i) Nature of rate regulated activities\n\nThe Group is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity. The price to be charged by the Group for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC which provides extensive guidance on the principles and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return.\n\nThis form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations which provide the Group to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement\n\n- (a)  As per the CERC Tariff Regulations, any gain or loss on account of exchange risk variation during the construction period shall form part of the capital cost till the declaration of Commercial Operation Date (COD) to be considered for calculation of tariff. The CERC during the past period in tariff orders for various stations has allowed exchange differences incurred during the construction period in the capital cost. Accordingly, exchange differences arising during the construction period is within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nFurther, any loss or gain on account of exchange differences on foreign currency loans for operating stations shall be recoverable from / payable to beneficiaries on actual payment basis, as per the said Regulations. Accordingly, such exchange differences are also within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nIn view of the above, exchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Movements in Regulatory deferral account balances' and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of (-) ' 390.80 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2021 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2020: ' 1,279.54 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.)\n\n- (b)  Revision of pay scales of employees of PSEs w.e.f. 1 January 2017 has been implemented based on the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The guidelines provide payment of superannuation benefits @ 30% of basic + DA to be provided to the employees of CPSEs which includes gratuity at the enhanced ceiling of ' 0.20 crore from the existing ceiling of ' 0.10 crore. As per Proviso 8(3) of Terms and Conditions of Tariff Regulations 2014 applicable for the period 2014-19, truing up exercise in respect of Change in Law or compliance of existing law will be taken up by CERC. The increase in gratuity limit from ' 0.10 crore to ' 0.20 crore falls under the category of 'Change in law' and a regulatory asset has been created.

The rates and methodology as per the CERC tariff regulations based on which depreciation for TrHEP has been calculated and charged to the Statement of Profit & Loss vary from that allowed to recover through tariff as per the CERC order. Due to higher rate of depreciation as per the CERC regulations, depreciation charged for the first 12 (twelve) years of operation TrHEP will be more than that of the depreciation recoverable through tariff, which will be reversed in future periods during remaining period of normative life of the generating station. Accordingly, the lower depreciation realized during the earlier period of its operation will be recovered/adjusted during later period.

Contract balances\n\nContract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are transferred to unbilled revenue when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from the customers which are referred as 'advances from customers /  payable to beneficiaries'.\n\nThe following table provides information about trade receivables, unbilled revenue and advances from customers:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                        | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 1 April 2020   | As at 1 April 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                    | Current               | Non-current           | Current              | Non-current          |\n| Trade receivables                                  | 17,718.07             | -                     | 20,314.59            | -                    |\n| Unbilled revenue                                   | 13,954.30             | -                     | 12,231.18            | -                    |\n| Advances from customers / Payable to beneficiaries | 1,782.65              | -                     | 843.01               | -                    |\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to change in transaction prices is ' 1,185.02 crore (31 March 2020 : ' 60.93 crore).\n\n## V. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\n\nPerformance obligations related to sale of energy:\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations, where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. Therefore, transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations cannot be determined reliably for the entire duration of the contract.\n\nPerformance obligations related to other contracts:\n\nFor rest of the contracts, transaction price for remaining performance obligations amounts to ' 723.34 crore (31 March 2020: ' 747.23 crore) which shall be received over the contract period in proportion of the work performed/services provided by the Group.\n\n## VI.  Practical expedients applied as per Ind AS 115:\n\n- a.    The Group has not disclosed information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date.\n- b.    The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group has not adjusted any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n- VII.  The Group has not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining contracts with a customer and therefore, not recognised an asset for such costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosure as per Ind AS 116 'Leases'\n\n## (A) Group as Lessee\n\n- (i) The Group's significant leasing arrangements are in respect of the following assets:\n- (a)   Premises for residential use of employees, offices and guest houses/ transit camps on lease which are not noncancellable and are usually renewable on mutually agreeable terms. The company generally incurs amount on improvements which are significant to the respective lease and hence the cancellable period of the lease during which the company intends to continue considering the past experience / practice, is considered for the purpose of determining the lease period.\n- (b)   The Group has taken electrical vehicles on operating lease for a period of five to six years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. Lease rentals are subject to escalation of 10% per annum.\n- (c)    A helicopter on wet lease basis.\n- (d)    The Group has taken certain vehicles (other than electrical) on lease for a period of more than one year to four years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. There are no escalations in the lease rentals as per terms of the agreement. However, the Group has purchase option for some of such vehicles at the end of the lease term.\n- (e)    The Group had entered into an agreement for movement of coal through inland waterways for one of its stations. As per the agreement, the operator was to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the unloading and material handling infrastructure for 7 years after which it was to be transferred to the Company at ' 1/-. Refer Note no. 60(iii)(b).\n- (f)   The Group acquires land on leasehold basis for a period generally ranging from 5 years to 99 years from the government authorities which can be renewed further based on mutually agreed terms and conditions. The leases are non cancellable. These leases are capitalised at the present value of the total minimum lease payments to be paid over the lease term. Future lease rentals are recognised as 'Lease liablities' at their present values.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nConsidering the requirement of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on 'Using the work of Another Auditor' including materiality, we draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n- (a)    Note No. 38(a)regarding billing and accounting of sales on provisional basis.\n- (b)    Note No. 50(a) in respect of one of the projects of Holding Company consisting of three units of 800MW each, where the order of National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the matter of environmental clearance for the project has been stayed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India; the matter is sub-judice and the units have since been declared commercial.\n- (c)    Note no. 50(b) in respect of one of the projects under construction consisting of two units of 800MW each, where the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed an order to keep the environment clearance granted to the project in abeyance, and directed to carry out additional studies relating to environmental impact assessment, and the Holding Company has filed an appeal before Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n- (d)    Note No. 60 (iii)(b) with respect to appeal filed by the Holding Company with the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of Arbitral award pronounced against the Holding Company and the related provision made/disclosure of contingent liability as mentioned in the said note.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report related to the Consolidated Financial Statements, but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon. The other information is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions, if required.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the Act, that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Ind AS Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and its Joint Ventures or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf0a7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0a7 Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  including  the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0a7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its joint ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- a) We did not audit the financial statements/ financial information  of Twelve subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statement, whose financial statements reflects total Assets of ' 76,313.50 crore and Net Assets ' 27,843.36 crore as at 31 March 2021; total Revenues of ' 15,353.59 crore and Net Cash Inflows amounting to ' 154.53 crore for the year ended on that date, as considered in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiaries and joint ventures, incorporated in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the 'Other Matters' paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls of the Group and its Joint Venture Companies incorporated in India, with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
