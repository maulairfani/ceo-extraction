At Tata Steel, we rolled out multi-pronged programmes to ensure the health and safety of all stakeholders, while boosting healthcare infrastructure and providing immediate relief to the community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting the community\n\nDuring the /first wave of COVID-19, the Tata Steel Foundation (TSF) undertook a 10-point #CombatCovid19 programme, reaching out to more than 10.5 lakh people across India.\n\nThe programme was recalibrated in early 2021 and has reached over 4.5 lakh people since. The basic objectives remain:\n\n- \u00bb Enhancing public health systems capacity for communities\n- \u00bb Meeting de/ficits of material, information and well-being\n- \u00bb Creating economic and other opportunities to address sociological impacts of the pandemic\n\nThe primary emphasis in 2021 has been on expeditiously closing gaps in key consumables and equipment available with public health systems that serve communities in remote areas of Jharkhand and Odisha. These include ~50,000 home isolation kits, 3,78,000 testing kits, 10 ventilators and oxygen concentrators, while more than 6,000 oximeters and 2,000 thermal scanners have been provided to frontline health workers to aid e/ffective early detection.\n\nVaccination remains one of the primary goals as well as challenges. Sensing the need to increase awareness around vaccination, as well as drive\n\nlarge-scale vaccination, we adopted a three-pronged approach to bring communities in and around our operational areas on board. Our digital campaign, #ApnoKiSuno, focussed towards e/ffective behavioural change communication through crowd-sourced videos from Village Heads on critical issues relating to vaccination. These videos helped secure 10,000+ registrations.\n\nWe are also helping people register online for COVID-19 vaccination. What began as an initiative in Odisha and Jharkhand has now turned into a nationwide campaign, reaching out to ~40,000 people through our\n\nReached out to 10.5 lakh\n\nlives during the /first wave\n\n## 6,000+\n\nhours of volunteering\n\n#DigitalBridges programme. Moreover, it also helps reduce crowding in facilities that provide public services. Along with Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur and the state government, we are facilitating vaccination at seven centres in the city.\n\nOur employee volunteering initiative, #FarRishta, has been activated to lend a helping hand at major vaccination centres in Jamshedpur.

For employees who lost their lives to COVID-19, we have extended our social security schemes to the family, including medical bene/fits; this policy covers both frontline employees and shop /floor workers.\n\nThe pandemic also invalidated the traditional thinking of productivity being contingent on /fixed hours of work within an o/ffice environment and bust many myths around remote working. We implemented an Agile Working Model in November 2020. Flexible working provided employees\n\nthe freedom to select work locations of their choice and helped them make decisions pertaining to their personal life to enable better work-life balance.\n\nThe new policies have encouraged a trust-based, outcome-driven culture as well as helped attract and retain the best talent available.

At the same time, we have experienced advancement that we could not have imagined - from scienti/fic breakthroughs to new ways of learning, living and working.\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic brought economic activity to a near-standstill in the /first half of FY 2020-21. Global growth plunged 3.5% Y-o-Y in 2020 - the deepest global recession since the Great Depression. India's (FY 2020-21) GDP is estimated to have contracted by 7.7% Y-o-Y. Yet despite the dramatic toll on lives and livelihoods, resurgent demand in China and a better-thanexpected post-lockdown recovery in H2 meant the e/ffect on the global steel industry was relatively benign.\n\n## Tata Steel's Four Pillars of Transformation\n\nTata Steel Group has pursued four broad dimensions of transformation that position us strongly and boldly for the future. This strategy re/flects in the steps we have taken during this di/fficult, pandemic-disrupted year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Resilience and Agility\n\nOne of the keys to our agility and resilience was a robust risk framework, which raised early red /flags related to the pandemic, giving the organisation an important head start - on the order of a month - for preparations which proved crucial.\n\nIn FY 2020-21, your Company achieved its highest ever consolidated EBITDA of ' 30,892 crore with 71% Y-o-Y growth, translating to an EBITDA per tonne of ' 10,838 and an EBITDA margin of ~20%. This was driven by higher prices, a better product mix, and operating e/fficiency initiatives. Your Company also recorded its highest-ever free cash /flow of ' 23,748 crore, driven by e/fficient management of working capital and a strong focus on cash.\n\nIn 2021, the global economy is poised to grow 6% Y-o-Y, driven by policy support and improving consumer sentiment. The outlook for the global steel industry in 2021 is positive, bene/fiting from the substantial /fiscal stimulus - especially infrastructure-supportive spending - by governments in the developed world and China, as well as the global manufacturing recovery.\n\nBeyond the near-term uncertainty, it is clear that the post-pandemic world will be unavoidably di/fferent. Recent years have been marked, for example, by elevated geo-political volatility, accelerated technology disruption and greater action to mitigate climate risks, among other important global trends. The pandemic has accelerated many of these shifts, while underscoring the pace at which we need to act to remain ahead of the curve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwo notable examples of resilience stand out. Despite challenging market conditions (India's FY 2020-21 GDP contracted 7.7% Y-o-Y), deliveries at Tata Steel India increased 2% over FY 2019-20, enabled by a seamless shift to exports in the /first half of the year. Tata Steel India was cash positive in Q1FY2021, a signi/ficant achievement given the pandemic. Your Company has reclassi/fied Tata Steel South East Asia operations to 'Continuing Operations' from 'Held for Sale', on the back of a 50% increase in EBITDA to ' 549 crore. This was enabled by higher prices and a focus on raw material cost reduction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of the enterprise deleveraging plan, Tata Steel Group completed deleveraging of net debt by ' 29,390 crore (~$4 billion) in FY 2020-21, surpassing the annual deleveraging target of $1 billion. As a result, its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has dropped to a healthy 2.4 in FY 2020-21, from 5.8 in FY 2019-20 and 3.2 in FY 2018-19.\n\nThis success has enabled us to continue critical capital expenditure focussed on India, including the ongoing Pellet plant and Cold Roll Mill commissioning at Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Once completed, these investments will help expand margins by boosting value-added products into the existing mix.\n\nWe progressed further on simplifying the India business to create four clusters: Long Products, Mining, Downstream and Utilities & Infrastructure Services. Most notably, progress was made on the Scheme to amalgamate Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel, with both companies' shareholders approving the Scheme at a March 2021 meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technology and Digital Leadership\n\nTata Steel plants have been recognised widely for the pioneering use of advanced analytics to optimise the way raw materials are used, as well as embedding - through capability building and worker training - the ability to continue driving improvements over time. In turn, this digital analytics e/ffort has helped raise margins by several percentage points, making Tata Steel plants among the most advanced steel plants globally.\n\nThis year, the Tata Steel Jamshedpur plant was recognised as part of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Lighthouse Network, in addition to our IJmuiden and Kalinganagar plants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enabling Planet Resilience\n\nLeadership in mitigating emissions, in accessing low-cost clean energy, and in providing circular economy solutions will de/fine our sector's journey going forward. Tata Steel India and Tata Steel Europe are already recognised as 'Sustainability Champions' by the World Steel Association (WSA). Tata Steel's IJmuiden plant is among the most\n\nOperational integration focussed on improved e/fficiencies has re/flected in the robust /financial performance of Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products, which delivered FY 2020-21 EBITDA of ' 5,481 crore and ' 1,154 crore respectively, a marked improvement on FY 2019-20 EBITDA of ' 2,370 crore and ' 184 crore, respectively.\n\nTata Steel BSL's performance is particularly commendable. Its EBITDA grew 131% from FY 2019-20 to FY 2020-21, as a result of increasing use of captive raw material, combined cargo planning (inbound and outbound), and manufacturing of Tata Steel branded products at Tata Steel BSL plants at arm's length. This rapid business transformation experience will be invaluable as the steel industry's consolidation continues over the next decade.\n\nIn Europe, the pandemic-induced economic contraction saw a 11% reduction in 2020 steel demand over 2019 and created considerable challenges for Tata Steel Europe. Following the termination of the discussions with SSAB on Tata Steel Netherlands, the Company is focussed on performance and cash /flows in the immediate term. The process to separate Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK  is  currently  underway.  Tata  Steel  remains  committed to arrive at a strategic and sustainable resolution for its European portfolio.\n\nBeyond core technology innovation, your Company will pursue its digital sales channel. Revenue through Tata Steel India's e-commerce portal Aashiyana increased to ' 726 crore - growing 130% over FY 2019-20 - enabled by more consumer touchpoints and higher adoption by ecosystem partners.\n\nGoing forward, we will focus on six areas of technology leadership: utilising low-quality raw material; coatings of the future; mobility; carbon capture and usage; hydrogen and water.\n\nenvironmentally e/fficient and cost competitive steel producers in Europe and as a result, Tata Steel Netherlands is ranked in top 5 lowest CO 2 emitting heavy industries by WSA.\n\nBut we know there is much more to be done. This year, we created the long term decarbonisation plan for Tata Steel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\nIndia, Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK. In India, we ventured into the Steel Recycling business, a de/finitive step towards a lower footprint production process across emissions, resource-use and energy consumption. During the year, the company sent out its /first raw material consignment of ferrous scrap for trials, from its Scrap Processing Plant (0.5 MnTPA capacity) at Rohtak, Haryana.\n\nWe are working to push our sustainability ambitions even further, exploring new manufacturing processes such as scrap-based electric arc furnaces and gas-based direct reduced iron; investing ahead on promising green technologies like Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS); assessing the long-term supply of key inputs such as clean electricity and biomass for hydrogen production; and securing supply of carbon o/ffsets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In conclusion\n\nAs the Indian economy recovers from the pandemic, ongoing reform measures and forward-looking policies such as 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' have the potential to boost the growth trajectory. The steel industry is also entering a phase which will see better spreads enabled by robust demand and geo-political factors. The strategic moves your Company has made over the last few years has given it the structural and /financial strength to capture the opportunities that arise going forward, while ensuring its resilience in the face of uncertainty and a dynamic operating environment. As we continue to position ourselves to capitalise on the opportunities\n\n## Tata Steel's COVID-19 response\n\nIn this pandemic-de/fined year, Tata Steel has made considerable e/fforts to support our employees, families and communities in a number of ways. The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India has seen a /five to seven-fold increase in the demand for medical oxygen. As of May 2021, Tata Steel India has cumulatively supplied 55,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen from our installations. We also helped debottleneck oxygen transportation in the country by importing 40 cryogenic tanks, and more tanks are in the pipeline.\n\nOver the entire pandemic period, your Company's #CombatCovid19 programme and direct COVID-Care support has reached the lives of over 1 million bene/ficiaries, providing medical and sustenance supplies, treatment, counselling and livelihood support. Across the Company's operating locations in Jharkhand and Odisha, over 1,600 COVID treatment beds were set up and 50,000 vaccinations administered. Over 2 million cooked meals were provided across various locations. In keeping with the ethos of the Tata Steel Group, we are continuing to deepen and broaden our e/fforts in timely response to the evolving nature of the pandemic.\n\nof the coming decade, we will strive to be a leader in the transition to a greener economy - aiming to create a virtuous cycle of growth and returns for our shareholders.\n\nThis is the challenge ahead of us and a new frontier in an exciting journey for the Tata group. As a large and diverse conglomerate based in India, but with a global footprint, we are uniquely positioned for this leadership. Our companies are present in 150 countries, we employ over 7,50,000 people and touch the lives of 650 million consumers. I will be the /first to say that we have a long journey ahead of us. But we are clear that this is the right journey we\n\nmust undertake and have begun with pushing targets and ambitions forward.\n\nBefore I end, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees and their families for their profound contributions in these trying times. I would also like to thank you shareholders for your continued trust, con/fidence, and support in the coming years.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nN.

The last year, though challenging, has been rewarding for Tata Steel. What are your thoughts on the performance of Tata Steel in FY 2020-21?\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak towards the end of FY 2019-20 brought economic activities to a near-standstill in the /first half of FY 2020-21. Restrictions imposed on movement of people and business activities to contain the spread resulted in the contraction of global GDP by 3.5% in CY2020. Since then, the global economy has been recovering, driven by /fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policies, followed by good progress in vaccination.\n\nDespite the challenges, uncertainties and complexities due to the pandemic, Tata Steel Group delivered a strong performance in FY 2020-21. Consolidated steel production was at 28.54 MnT while total deliveries stood at 28.50 MnT, marginally below that of the previous year. Our consolidated revenues increased by 5% to \u20b91,56,294 crore, driven by strong underlying performance of our India operations and improved performance of our European operations.\n\nIn India, despite a slow start in the /first quarter of FY 2020-21, we delivered a strong performance for the year. Our business decisions during the year pivoted around cash /flows and internal fund generations. Hence balancing of sales between domestic and export markets supported by an agile supply chain was crucial for our success in the /first half, while the second half witnessed a strong economic recovery. Most of the steel consuming sectors rebounded with support from government spending, pent-up demand and easing liquidity. Our India operations (which include Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products) generated revenues of \u20b991,037 crore, up 11% Y-o-Y.\n\nStakeholders\n\nand Materiality\n\nThe EBITDA margin of the India business was around 31.4% and that of Tata Steel (standalone) was 33.8% which demonstrates the strength of the business.\n\nOverall, we achieved a consolidated EBITDA of \u20b930,892 crore, driven by multiple factors including improved market environment, a better product mix, continued cost takeout programmes and bene/fits derived through operational and /financial e/fficiency. With disciplined capital allocation and tight working capital management, Tata Steel's full year free cash /flow after capex was \u20b923,748 crore. In FY 2020-21, consolidated pro/fit after tax for Tata Steel Group stood at \u20b98,190 crore, signi/ficantly above \u20b91,172 crore reported a year ago. The increase was mainly due to a signi/ficant improvement in the underlying business performance resulting in a robust level of earnings for the year.\n\n## Q. Deleveraging has been your strategy for a few years now and FY 2020-21 was very successful for Tata Steel on that front. Can you walk us through this achievement?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, our business decisions are pivoted on cash /flows. During an unprecedented year like FY 2020-21 it was important to conserve cash /flows using multiple levers. Using discretionary judgement towards this goal, we prioritised our capital expenditure across the Tata Steel Group level and restricted our spend to about \u20b97,000 crore. Our focus on operational excellence, including working capital management and aggressive liquidity management, helped us reduce our net debt by \u20b929,390 crore. As a result, our consolidated net debt at year end was at \u20b975,389 crore, down 28% from FY 2019-20. While as a policy we have an annual target to reduce our gross debt by $1 billion, we have accelerated our deleveraging programme and reduced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour net debt substantially during the year. Our credit metrics at the end of the year have improved substantially with Net Debt to EBITDA under 2.5x and Net Debt to Equity less than 1x on a consolidated basis. Going forward, in FY 2021-22, we intend to reduce the debt further while prioritising capital allocation on the on-going expansion project in Kalinganagar.\n\n## Q. What are the major focus areas for FY 2021-22?\n\nStrengthening the Balance Sheet continues to be the enterprise strategy of the Company. While we are seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases in the second wave across the country, we are focussed on completing the Cold Rolling Mill complex and the Pellet Plant in Kalinganagar in the next 12 months. Both these projects are margin expansionary and are very high IRR projects. We have also restarted the work on the upstream expansion in Kalinganagar. We aim to strike an optimal balance between capital expenditure and debt repayment.\n\nWe are also expediting the simpli/fication of Tata Steel Group portfolio and creation of four major business clusters - Long Products, Downstream, Mining, Utilities & Infrastructure Services. We are also on course to amalgamate the business of Tata Steel BSL into Tata Steel and smooth integration of Tata Steel BSL is important. We have obtained the approval of shareholders on the scheme of amalgamation and are now working towards obtaining the necessary statutory approvals. It is important to mention that since acquisition, Tata Steel BSL has reduced its leverage signi/ficantly by ~60% and therefore has signi/ficantly paid back the acquisition cost. We are also focussing on enhancing our footprint in the long products and the mining business.",

In Services and Solutions, we are restructuring our distribution channels to cater to di/fferent segments while enhancing our manufacturing and execution capability. As we are seeing an urgent need for enhancing health infrastructure in the country, our Nest-In prefabricated product is now being deployed in providing COVID-19 isolation centres and for expansion of COVID-19 bed capacity across the country. We are therefore scaling up capacity and capability in this space. In the New Materials business, we are investing in creating a robust new product funnel while building strategic relationships. Sustainability and climate continues to be core focus areas in our strategy and business operations. We will continue to reduce our carbon emission footprint through process innovation and operational e/fficiency improvements.\n\nWe are also strengthening our business enablers. Tata Steel over the past few years has invested in building its digital infrastructure, which helped tide over not only the initial phase of the pandemic but continues to provide us with the critical enabler for business analytics and automation. We will continue to invest very signi/ficantly in digital across all business processes in the Company.

We will continue to progress on the technology roadmap to create innovative products, invest in new processes and rework our business model in the future. Our workforce is one of our key assets. In FY 2020-21, Tata Steel was recognised as the best workplace in manufacturing (fourth time in a row) by Great Place To Work and in the coming year we will continue to work on diversity and inclusion. All of these initiatives are part of our strategy to be future ready and build on the foundations of an agile culture across the organisation.\n\nThe process to reorganise our European portfolio, including the separation of Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK businesses, is in progress. This will lead to more focus, higher performance accountability and optimise the global footprint. The Transformation Programme aimed at improving productivity and rationalisation of costs has started delivering in the last year and we expect to accelerate it further in the year ahead.\n\n## Q. Globally many organisations are focussing on their responsibility towards sustainable business practices. What steps is Tata Steel taking on this front?\n\nAt Tata Steel, sustainability has always been core to our strategy and business operations. As a responsible corporate citizen, we /firmly believe in creating long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. We recognise our responsibility towards our people, our communities, the environment, and the planet at large. We are taking steps aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and have incorporated the same in our long-term strategy and sustainability targets. As a responsible corporate, Tata Steel supports the UN Global Compact and strives to integrate its 10 principles in all facets of the business.\n\nWe are also leveraging technology to enhance our environmental responsiveness and are on course to establishing best-in-class manufacturing and distribution facilities to improve our operational and environmental performance. Tata Steel, being a signatory to the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, has identi/fied transition risks and opportunities to decarbonise its operations over a period and plans to mitigate these risks across all geographies.\n\nWe have also made progress in our steel recycling business initiative, which is a de/finitive step towards sustainable steel production. It will enable us to achieve lower carbon emissions, resource consumption and energy utilisation. During the year under review, we despatched our /first raw material consignment of ferrous scrap for trials from the state-of-the-art scrap processing plant of 0.5 MnTPA at Rohtak, Haryana. We will continue our quest to remain industry leaders in sustainability by setting new benchmarks for a better tomorrow.\n\nSupply chain is an integral part of our operations. We have adopted a Responsible Supply Chain Policy which is based on four important principles of Fair Business Practice, Human Rights, Health and Safety and Environmental Protection.\n\nBoth, Tata Steel India and Tata Steel Europe have been recognised by the World Steel Association as Steel Sustainability Champions for the fourth year in a row. The recognition is a testament to our commitment to sustainable business practices and our continued e/fforts to go beyond stakeholder expectations. During FY 2020-21, we also became a member of ResponsibleSteel\u2122 the steel industry's /first global multi-stakeholder standard and certi/fication initiative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\nSupporting communities during unprecedented times\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to pursue our goal to be the industry leader in sustainability by reducing our CO 2 emission intensity and speci/fic fresh water consumption, developing sustainable supply chain and contributing towards the future circular economy.\n\nQ. While the focus on achieving growth for the business is important, the COVID-19 pandemic is still not over, and this is certainly a risk for your people. What steps have you taken to ensure the safety and well-being of your people in these times?\n\nYes, the pandemic continues to be very prevalent in the country and the world. As we have always maintained, our people are our /first priority. We are committed to achieving 'Zero Harm' and are working on various strategies to continuously enhance the health and safety standards within the organisation.\n\nOur primary focus during the pandemic continues to be on the safety and well-being of our employees. The frontline employees who have been running the operations, supply chain and commercial functions have been working tirelessly during the year to ensure smooth functioning of the business. We adopted the POD concept across our operations which ensured continuity of business operation while containing the\n\ninfection. Using our digital tracking app 'Suraksha', we were able to continuously monitor our workforce. Risk pro/filing of employees provided visibility of critical skillset availability to plan and manage operations which avoided any production loss due to closure or stoppage of facility. The deployment of video-based analytics ensured adherence of social distancing and mask wearing norms. Supported by 'Anywhere, Anytime, Secure computing', we were able to seamlessly shift to a work from home model and continued production with a skeletal on-site workforce. We also proactively ramped up medical infrastructure in all our areas of operations which catered to the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Q. Tata Steel has always been recognised for its service to the community at large. Can you highlight your contributions to help the society?\n\nDuring the last year, our CSR programme reached more than 16 lakh (1.6 million) lives in the areas of health, access to drinking water, education, livelihood, sports and infrastructure development and most importantly through the interventions to support the community to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the /first wave of the pandemic in India, we could support about 10 lakh (1 million) citizens. We supported the communities and migrant labourers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatutory\n\nReports\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, we are deeply committed to providing resources and support to help the community in all possible ways during this unprecedented crisis in the country.\n\nof the region with food, sustainable livelihood, provided safety support to the vulnerable communities and augmented the medical facilities at the designated hospitals for medical treatment.\n\nIn response to the health and sociological consequences of the second wave of the pandemic in recent months, we further scaled up our health and medical infrastructure. We now have around 1,600+ COVID-19 beds in the hospitals run or partnered by the Company which has all the modern facilities to treat COVID-19 patients, who are mostly from the community in and around our operations in Jharkhand and Odisha. Our frontline employees, be it doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab technicians, ward boys, volunteers and all support sta/ff including the CSR employees, security personnel, employees manning civic facilities at di/fferent locations have been working tirelessly to support the CSR and community support programmes of the Company.

Fast-paced technological changes and shifting customer preferences may necessitate adoption of newer grades of steel and/or alternate materials.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nAs domestic steel demand plunged due to COVID-19 induced lockdowns in Q1FY2021, sales were diverted for exports. New international markets were explored which provided better net realisations. Support was provided to distributors impacted by liquidity crunch. To support the /fight against the pandemic, we designed and launched isolation and quarantine units using Nest-In and NMB solutions. During the lockdown, focus was on generating and conserving cash for exigencies.\n\nThe implementation of unlock measures in June 2020, resulted in faster than expected recovery for steel-intensive sectors. Initially the focus was on sales in non-containment zones and subsequently in improving domestic availability by reducing exports. With the improvement\n\n## Strategic linkage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership in India\n\nAttain leadership position in adjacent businesses\n\nin demand for steel globally, the realisations improved sharply. We remain vigilant of the evolving pandemic situation and its impact on steel-intensive sectors.\n\nIn our endeavour to enhance footprint in India, we have built a diversi/fied portfolio of product o/fferings for customers from a range of industries to counter slowdown in any one sector, region or segment. Dedicated marketing and sales teams service customers and build deep customer engagement by customising products, improving reliability and providing value added services. Tata Steel has invested in building a strong marketing franchise with wellregarded brands and a large network of dealers and retailers across the country.

It has also built distribution channels internationally to enable exports as and when desired.\n\nSteel is a cyclical industry and the only way to beat this cyclicality is by o/ffering solutions. We have forayed into ready-to-use steel for construction industry and introduced products such as steel doors and windows, furniture to enhance our retail customer base. Sustainable solutions (coated products) such as GalvaRoS and Colornova and customised solutions for the agriculture sector like Agronest have been introduced. We are also diversifying our product o/ffering beyond steel by introducing new materials like composites, Fibre Reinforced Products, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n## Commodity risks\n\nRaw materials (mainly coal and iron ore) are a signi/ficant contributor to the input cost in steelmaking. These commodities have global supply chains and their prices get impacted by various factors such as dynamic geopolitical landscape, supply-demand imbalance, weather patterns, policy interventions by governments in key sourcing/ consuming countries (especially China), etc. Our pro/fitability can get signi/ficantly impacted due to the volatility in raw material prices.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nThere is a signi/ficant co-relation between raw material and steel prices (sometimes with a lag). The balance risk is addressed through matching the sales tenure with the procurement tenure (e.g. annual /fixed price steel contract to have an underlying /fixed price iron ore) either through physical contracts or through use of hedging instruments.

This is fostered through continuous dialogue, understanding of vulnerabilities, recognition of aspirations and appreciation of cultural nuances leading to a relationship based on trust. A dilution in this approach will lead to an erosion of trust with communities, slowdown in societal impact and consequent loss of reputation or business continuity for us.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nTata Steel anchors one of the deepest and most diverse societal development e/fforts based on a combination of programmes and platforms reaching more than 1.5 million lives directly every year. The impact programmes are crafted as replicable change models on themes such as education, public health, tribal identity, livelihoods, agriculture, water, disability, etc., which are based on a contemporary understanding of core development challenges of the region and closely aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda. The impact ambitions are predicated on platforms for continuous dialogue\n\nacross communities, with emphasis on marginalised and vulnerable groups, to create a shared agenda for the impacts to be felt by those who need them the most. These have yielded signi/ficant long-term results like more than 1,200 habitations being declared child labour free zones and 40% decline in maternal and child mortality rates in the last few years, while curating positive social capital and e/ffective leadership amongst communities. We have a portfolio of products which is aimed at addressing societal challenges like low-cost housing, farm income enhancement while key business processes are also\n\n## Strategic linkage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic enablers\n\n## Capitals impacted\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Manufactured capital\n\nSocial and Relationship capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndesigned to have a clear diversity and a/ffirmative action perspective.\n\nThis depth was particularly evident during the pandemic, where we collaborated with communities to implement a 10-point #CombatCovid19 programme which (a) addressed the information and awareness gap, (b) met de/ficits in essential supplies and (c) created robust systems to last beyond the lockdown.

Any deviation in compliance and adherence has the potential to not only impact our operating performance but also dent our reputation. The continuously evolving regulatory scenario, resulting in changes of the statutory provisions and introduction of newer ones, make compliance more complex.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nWe are continuously scanning the regulatory canvas to understand the changing statutes and their implications, along with closely monitoring restrictive trade policies globally, that could in/fluence our procurement decisions and market footprint, to protect and generate business value.

        "page_content": "## OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## Favourably positioned for growth\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted traditional business models, creating new opportunities and business models that embed sustainability. With India's continued infrastructure push and low per capital steel consumption, demand for steel is likely to increase signi/ficantly going forward. At Tata Steel, we continuously evaluate the evolving trends and respond proactively to capitalise on the emerging opportunities.\n\n## Increasing steel demand in India\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Indian economy is likely to become the third largest economy by 2030, and the steel industry will play a pivotal role in this growth journey.\n\nWith large raw material reserves, strong base of technically skilled manpower and one of the fastest growing markets in the world, India has de/finite structural advantages for a successful steel industry. The National Steel Policy 2017 seeks to create a globally competitive steel industry in India with 300 million tonne steelmaking capacity and 158 kg per capita steel consumption by FY 2030-31. The growth in demand will come from traditional, as well as emerging consuming sectors focussing on changing needs of customers. Government-led investment in infrastructure, rapid urbanisation, rising preference for personal mobility, growth in capital goods sector, and government focus on making India 'Aatmanirbhar' are expected to stimulate steel demand in India. The acceleration of the rural economy is also emerging as a potential demand driver for steel. The Government has taken an objective of increasing rural per capita consumption of steel from current 19.6 kg to 38 kg by FY 2030-31. With a leadership position in key market segments, world-class production facilities, and cost leadership position, Tata Steel is well poised to bene/fit from this large opportunity.\n\n## Evolving customer needs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs customer needs evolve, the nature of steel consumption and the channel deployed to reach the customer will also change.\n\nGrowing urbanisation will see demand for steel focussed on modularisation, amenable to the fast pace of construction and better aesthetics. In addition, with changing demographics and higher a/ffordability, the nature of steel consumption in sectors such as automobiles, white goods and other consumer goods is fast evolving. Along with new products, there is a focus towards servitisation and providing higher convenience. A culture of customer-obsession and providing customers with the best products and experience will enable Tata Steel to be the supplier of choice for discerning customers.\n\n## Climate change driving new business models\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile climate change is a key risk for a 'hard to abate' sector such as steel, it also provides an opportunity to take a leadership role in the steel industry by reducing our environmental footprint.\n\nAs the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus on sustainability is at the forefront with a signi/ficant amount of the global stimulus directed towards green technology. To position itself as a leader in sustainability, Tata Steel has already identi/fied technology leadership areas in Hydrogen technology leadership areas in hydrogen technology, carbon capture and use, and reduction in speci/fic water consumption. Tata Steel Jamshedpur is a national benchmark in CO 2 emission. Speci/fic plans are in place to improve sustainability performance in other locations. We have ventured into the steel recycling business, leveraging the expected increase in scrap availability in India.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n## Steel industry leadership in technology and innovation\n\nLeveraging in-house capabilities and building partnerships to adopt technologies of tomorrow.\n\nEvolving consumer needs and growing focus on sustainability will require innovation in process, product, and business models supported by a strong technology management process. Organisations can create a di/fferentiated position by focussing on creating the technology of tomorrow. Tata Steel aspires to be a technology and\n\ninnovation leader in the steel industry. Towards this vision, we leverage our in-house potential and build external ecosystems through carefully curated collaborations and partnerships. The VIVA (Ventures, Innoventure and Alliances) team has been formed to explore innovation opportunities provided by the external ecosystem\n\nand accelerate our journey towards achieving technology leadership. The Innovent team focusses on consumer in innovation through a deep understanding of their emerging needs. Our collaborations with start-ups are expected to stimulate agile innovation and gain competitive edge in various parts of the value chain.\n\n## Venture into Adjacent Businesses to leverage market opportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnology shifts are creating market opportunities for new materials and applications in existing and emerging sectors.\n\nTata Steel with its portfolio of materials is best suited to leverage this trend and, in the process, create adjacent revenue streams that complement the steel business. We are building new businesses in high-potential new materials such as Fibre Reinforced Polymer composites, medical materials and graphene.\n\n## Culturally ready to leverage current and future opportunities\n\nSeveral initiatives undertaken over the past decades have helped ingrain a culture of ethics, safety, continuous improvement, environment consciousness and giving back to the community in the organisation.\n\nWe are respected in the industry for many 'industry-/first initiatives'. Our focus on diversity and LGBTQ policies are /first of its kind. We are also fostering a culture of agility, innovation, and health and wellness. Several seeding actions have been initiated, which will enable us to become culturally future ready.\n\n## Digitalisation - a source of competitive advantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe future of work is evolving rapidly, accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nRemote operations with skeletal on-site workforce is the new normal. Usage of video analytics and sensor-based plant operations is signi/ficantly disrupting traditional operations and maintenance practices. Digital is no longer just an enabler but core to the way plants operate and is key for creating and unlocking value. It is enabling a simpler, more agile, and e/fficient organisation. Tata Steel is also taking steps to scale Industry 4.0 technologies in its operations. During FY 2020-21, Tata Steel Jamshedpur became our second plant in India to be recognised as Industry 4.0 Lighthouses by the World Economic Forum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The highest standards of environment management are followed in mining locations while using the best available technologies.\n\n## Rolling and Processing\n\nThe rolling mills help in manufacturing a diverse product mix with customised shapes, sizes, and various chemical and technical properties. Aligned with customer speci/fications and requirements, these products undergo stringent quality checks and assurance processes. We also produce a range of valueadded products for the retail markets and provide customised solutions to industrial buyers.\n\n## Iron and Steel Making\n\nWe produce steel through the conventional blast furnace route. Raw materials are converted to hot metal and crude steel through various processes including coke making, sinter making and pelletisation. The processes are designed to deliver high productivity with the available resources while managing slag rate and steelmaking requirements.\n\n## Steel Recycling Business\n\nAs an initiative to be future-ready and establish the supply chain for scrap, we had set up our Steel Recycling Business in FY 2018-19. The /first steel scrap processing unit was commissioned at Rohtak in Haryana, with an initial capacity of 0.5 MnTPA in FY 2020-21. With the /first unit templatised, we plan to replicate such modular units across India.\n\n## One Supply Chain\n\nTata Steel has a long-integrated value chain that extends from mining to /finished steel products with an interconnected network of suppliers, mines, ports, manufacturing locations, stockyards, processing facilities, channel partners and customers.\n\nThe organic and inorganic expansion over the years has added to the complexity of multi-location operations. Tata Steel's Supply Chain Management handles planning, sourcing, delivery and logistics of ~100 MnT materials which includes raw materials, /finished goods and by-products. With the integration of Supply Chain functions into 'One Supply Chain', there is an increased focus on end-to-end margin management in raw materials and /finished goods through synergies between hubs. VIU (Value-In-Use) based cost models have been built for the distribution of raw materials (coal-coke and metallics) across sites for achieving global optima. Similar work is in progress for products leveraging integrated IT solutions and di/fferentiated customer delivery\n\nstrategy. During the year under review, several initiatives were taken up to make our Supply Chain future-ready and sustainable through infrastructure investments, technological excellence and engagement with supply chain partners for deployment of Responsible Supply Chain Policy.\n\nOutbound logistics is about 60% dependent on railways and 40% on roadways at various locations. It consists of a network of warehouses and Steel Processing Centres (SPCs), ensuring timely delivery and transportation of /finished products to meet on-time delivery expectations of customers. This is enabled by a network of hubs and stockyards at strategic locations across India to ensure delivery cycles are as low as 48 hours from stockyards.\n\n## By-products Management\n\nOur Industrial By-products Management Division (IBMD) manages a variety of by-products and scrap generated across the entire steel value chain and has adopted circular economy principles as an integral part of its business values.\n\nA dedicated Marketing & Sales organisation for by-products focusses on expanding pro/fitability through marketing initiatives and downstream value enhancement of byproducts.\n\nIn FY 2020-21, the accelerated weathering facility for LD slag has enabled signi/ficant ramp-up of the utilisation of\n\nprocessed slag in construction of national highways. A new by-product value-creation centre with modern processing equipment has been commissioned at Tata Steel Jamshedpur to facilitate higher scrap consumption at LD shops for reducing GHG emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n## Our Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mining and Bene/ficiation\n\n## Facilities/Equipment\n\n- \u00bb Iron ore, coal, chrome and manganese ore mines\n- \u00bb Bene/ficiation plant\n- \u00bb Logistics and handling facilities\n- \u00bb State-of-the-art mining and mineral processing technology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rolling Mills\n\nFacilities/Equipment\n\n- \u00bb Flat and long products mills\n- \u00bb Wire rods/drawing facilities\n- \u00bb Tube-making facility\n- \u00bb Billet to bar/rod facility\n- \u00bb Rolling Tandem Mill for pickling and rolling\n- \u00bb Hot dip galvanising facility\n- \u00bb Slab to coil facility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Iron and Steelmaking\n\nFacilities/Equipment\n\n- \u00bb Bell-less top charge high-capacity blast furnaces\n- \u00bb Basic oxygen furnace for steelmaking\n- \u00bb Coke, sinter and pelletising plants\n- \u00bb Raw material handling facilities\n- \u00bb Online granulation of blast furnace slag\n- \u00bb Stamp charging battery\n- \u00bb Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ)\n- \u00bb Desulphurisation facility\n- \u00bb Secondary steelmaking\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## By-products Processing\n\nFacilities/Equipment\n\n- \u00bb Metal recovery plant\n\n\u00bb Slag processing plant\n\n## Way forward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImprove availability and utilisation of plants to best-in-class levels\n\nScale up Steel Recycling Business\n\nCompletion of Cold Rolling Mill complex and Pellet Plant at Tata Steel Kalinganagar\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through digital interventions across its value chain, we have been able to drive EBITDA improvements, remodel work practices by enhancing digital maturity and, in the process, have become more insightful, intelligent and agile.\n\nCloud, Data & Arti/ficial Intelligence (AI) are the building blocks of Tata Steel's digital transformation journey. We have made substantial investments to augment network, computing, and cyber security capabilities. We have moved ~85% of our servers to the cloud over the last 3 years in one of the biggest cloud migration programmes in Asia. Our cyber security cell is equipped with the necessary expertise and tools to pre-empt cyber threats and intrusions.\n\nThe investments made on building a robust infrastructure proved critical during FY 2020-21, when a large part of the organisation was forced to operate remotely due to the pandemic. Without any special e/fforts, we were able to seamlessly connect to the Company's network while working from home and continued production even with a skeletal workforce present at the mines and plants. With ~8,000 employees logging into enterprise applications and ~3,500 virtual meetings taking place each day, we were running business as usual with no adverse impact on employee productivity. Through the Suraksha Platform, we ensured health and safety of our employees. Video analytics was used to identify people without face coverings, and pre-empt and detect violation of social distancing at shop /floors, canteens and on roads. Suraksha Scanners enabled security personnel at entry gates scan RFID\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncards through smart phones and extract relevant information on Travel Declaration and Suraksha Compliance of our contract workforce. These initiatives were bundled together and accessed through a single dashboard, thereby ensuring immediate response. Our digital response to COVID-19 was ranked among the top 6% globally by Gartner.\n\nWe are also transforming from a process-driven company to a data driven one. The objective is to use data to generate better business insights and drive decision making, coupled with streamlined and robust business processes. As a testimony to our e/fforts during the year under review, Tata Steel Jamshedpur (TSJ) steel plant was recognised as World Economic Forum's Advanced 4th Industrial Revolution Lighthouse for showing leadership in applying advanced technologies to drive /financial and operational impact. With this, Tata Steel now has three manufacturing sites in the Global Lighthouse network, with Tata Steel Kalinganagar Plant (India) and IJmuiden (the Netherlands) being the other two sites.\n\nOur e-commerce platforms such as Aashiyana, DigECA, and Compass provided alternate channels for driving sales and customer connect. Through digital interventions, we achieved a 30% reduction in customer\n\ncomplaint resolution time. The Vendor Performance Improvement Programme platform which has been designed to cover the contractor workforce in all locations for safety, security and productivity, provides end-toend visibility of work patterns of the workforce across plants and helps preempt unsafe incidents while improving productivity.\n\nTo digitally enable operations, Tata Steel has developed multiple assetspeci/fic algorithms to predict failures as well as residual life of equipment. This has minimised failure scenarios for mission-critical equipment and eliminated unplanned downtime. The Smart Asset Maintenance Platform is helping achieve higher asset availability at lower maintenance cost, across equipment from mines to rolling mills through enhanced sensorisation and building predictive analytics solutions.\n\nWe have revamped our procurement process by introducing digital catalogue-based buying, commodity price prediction-aided buying, analytics-powered negotiation tools for Category Managers and end-toend contract lifecycle management and analytics. Our Procurement 4.0 platform has enabled ~50% reduction in vendor registration cycle time and ~20% reduction in order processing cycle time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatutory\n\nReports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total Quality Management and Shikhar25\n\nTotal Quality Management (TQM) way of working is embedded in the culture of Tata Steel. TQM techniques are regularly deployed in operations and maintenance processes for achieving consistent quality and e/fficient performance. Shikhar25 is a focussed EBITDA improvement programme, which promotes e/fficiency, sustenance and right behaviours across departments of Tata Steel.\n\nThe programme is aimed at improving operational e/fficiency, energy e/fficiency, lower costs, optimise product mix, reduce and recycle waste through impact centres across Tata Steel. During the pandemic-impacted year, we revisited the various aspects of /fixed cost to ensure reduced expenditure and maintain healthy cash/flow. Also,\n\nwith increased production capacities, the emphasis has been on simplifying and synergising operations across sites for optimal utilisation of resources to reduce cost. During the year under review, a total of 931 projects were implemented and savings of \u20b93,274 crore accrued across the organisation.\n\n## Way forward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerate innovation and technology leadership through strategic collaborations with multiple research and industrial organisations and partnerships with start-ups\n\nGrow adjacent revenue streams by commercialising in-house IP and knowledge through new products in new markets and services\n\nAchieve growth in other materials with world class technologies and products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nGovernance\n\nCapitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cell also looks at corrective and preventive measures to deal with cases of violations of our TCoC and Social Accountability Policy. The contractor safety management process ensures that a safe and healthy workplace is provided to the entire contract workforce. Periodic assessments and ratings are carried out to upgrade the contractor's safety standards.\n\n## Indigenous communities\n\nTata Steel's operations require signi/ficant resettlement and rehabilitation of indigenous communities residing in proximity of its operating sites.

We are working on deployment of key enablers for deep decarbonisation, including the use of more scrap in steelmaking, use of alternate fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen, and deployment of carbon capture and storage/utilisation technologies. We continue to adopt the best available technologies for waste heat recovery such as Top Recovery Turbine (TRT), Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ), use of by-product gases in power generation and other energy e/fficiency measures, resulting in improvement of resource e/fficiency as well as reduction of carbon footprint.\n\nWe are actively engaging with technology companies, academia, companies from other sectors having similar challenges on development and scale-up of deep decarbonisation technologies such as CCUS, hydrogen generation and its use in steelmaking, use of biomass and other alternate ironmaking routes. Tata Steel has signed an agreement with Shell India Markets Private Limited to evaluate and co-develop short- and long-term options for improvement in energy e/fficiency, optimisation of demand around carbon-intensive products and services\n\nand others.

Our e/fforts on water conservation hinge on minimising withdrawal of fresh water from rivers and maximising the recycling of treated e/ffluents within the plants as well as domestic sewage. Speci/fic fresh water consumption of TSJ (2.25 m 3 /tcs in FY 2020-21, excluding drinking water consumption) is one of the lowest in the steel industry in India. In our pursuit to make Jamshedpur the /first city in India to achieve zero sewage discharge into the river, two Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) with capacity of 45 million litres per day (MLD) and 16 MLD have been installed\n\nin the city and treated water from the STPs is being reused in plant operations. During FY 2020-21, we successfully completed the CRM Bara Rejuvenation Project resulting in the creation of a larger rainwater harvesting facility, improvement in water table of local area and increase in biological diversity. Technological advances coupled with adoption of best practices, such as reusing of treated town sewage water for industrial purpose at Jamshedpur works, recycling of industrial e/ffluent at all sites and recovery of storm runo/ff water at Kalinganagar works has enabled reduction of speci/fic fresh water consumption by 41% and 46% at TSJ and TSK, respectively since FY 2016-17.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata Steel has been actively working with several organisations to enhance its performance in biodiversity conservation and signi/ficantly reduce its impact on the ecosystem and biodiversity.\n\nOur Indian operations are not located in any of the identi/fied biodiversity hotspots or protected areas. During FY 2020-21, we developed BMPs for Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar, planted over 2.98 lakh saplings of native species across locations, developed a 12-hectare Ecological\n\nImportance Park on MSW Dumpsite at Jamshedpur and rejuvenated the 5.6 hectare CRM Bara Pond at Jamshedpur.

The wide range of industrial by-products serves as key raw materials to various industries such as cement, chemical, construction, among others. During FY 2020-21, we achieved process solid waste utilisation of >99% at TSJ and TSK, and focussed synergy initiatives have enabled knowledge transfer and horizontal deployment of best practices across our recently acquired facilities of TSBSL and TSLP.\n\nBy leveraging digital technologies, Tata Steel has created a resilient ecosystem for by-product management, which helped in successfully addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. Agile and connected supply chain helped increase e/fficiency of material movement and ensure safer operations. The accelerated weathering facility for LD slag has enabled us to ramp up the utilisation of processed slag in the construction of national highways and downstream products such as soil conditioners, paver blocks, among others. During FY 2020-21, supplies\n\nof Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) started from Kalinganagar and has been successfully established in the market.\n\nTata Steel commenced operations of a future-ready by-product processing and value creation centre with modern baling units and mechanised processing facility in Jamshedpur. The Metal Recovery Plant (MRP) is now operational at Dhenkanal and Gamharia plants as well, helping to enhance internal consumption of by-products and o/ffer value-added products for external markets.\n\nTata Steel won the prestigious CII 3R Awards 2020 at the CII International Conference for demonstrating the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) principles in by-products management.\n\nBy 2030, we target to achieve material e/fficiency of 100% while sustaining solid waste utilisation of 100% across all locations and increasing EBITDA by 2.4 times from by-product business.\n\n## Steel recycling business\n\n## Steel has the unique property of being in/finitely recyclable. Primarily, the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) method for steelmaking, with lower carbon footprint, is used for re-melting of steel.\n\nHigher usage of scrap for steelmaking in India is currently limited due to lower availability of scrap and a fragmented scrap supply chain. To be future-ready and establish the supply chain for scrap, we set up our steel recycling business in FY 2019-20. We successfully commissioned our /first steel scrap recycling plant of 0.5 MnTPA in September 2020 at Rohtak, Haryana. It is a state-of-the-art plant with mechanised equipment such as shredder, baler, material handler for processing, handling and producing high-quality scrap. Steel scrap is procured from market segments such as End of\n\nLife Vehicle (ELV) scrap, obsolete household scrap, industrial scrap, etc. This scrap is processed through mechanised equipment and the high-quality processed scrap is supplied to electric arc furnaces (EAFs), induction furnaces (IFs) and foundries for downstream steelmaking. We have launched various /first-of-its-kind initiatives in the global scrap industry such as branding of Scrap, FerroHaat app for buying and selling scrap, among others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nGovernance\n\nCapitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

During FY 2020-21, multiple sessions were conducted on new and emerging technologies and processes across various improvements areas such as quality, delivery, productivity, safety and sustainability. The sessions, conducted with our strategic vendor partners, helped create value for both Tata Steel and its supplier partners while creating a value pipeline.\n\n## CEO to CEO connect with strategic suppliers\n\nA new structured programme of CEO to CEO connect was started in FY 2020-21 in which CEO & MD and the Senior Leadership team of Tata Steel interact with global CEOs and leadership team of select strategic suppliers. The objective is to strengthen business relationships, share future business plans and identify high-impact innovation ideas which can be pursued collaboratively.\n\n## Engagement with raw material suppliers\n\nDeveloping supplier partnerships through long-term projects in the imported coal value chain is critical for reducing the overall cost of production in the long run. Understanding strategic plans of key suppliers and creation of mutually bene/ficial products have helped maximise the supply of coal that has higher value-in-use (VIU) and is most suitable for our coke plant con/figuration. We have ensured raw material supply security by developing new relationships in Russia, Canada and Indonesia. We have also created alternative supply chain models for coking coal, enabled by vendor-managed inventory at Indian ports. This has facilitated supply chain security, credit enhancement and optimisation of inventory, leading to e/fficient management of complex multi-site operations. The four key areas for collaboration focusses on carbon capture, usage and storage, coal quality optimisation, mining and bene/ficiation technology and processes, and ironmaking and steelmaking technologies for improving Tata Steel's sustainability.\n\n## Responsible Supply Chain Policy\n\nOur Responsible Supply Chain Policy (RSCP) aims at encouraging supply chain partners to integrate sustainability principles in their decisions and processes in line with Tata Steel's commitment to sustainable business practices. The Policy focusses on sensitising suppliers about the need to implement sustainable business practices and inculcate the same culture in their supply chain. The Policy is guided by four principles: Fair Business Practices, Health & Safety, Human Rights, and Environmental Protection. We started the sustainability assessment journey with our critical vendor partners. More than 200 suppliers were assessed in FY 2020-21 with a spend coverage of around 33%.\n\n## Indigenisation and localisation\n\nIn view of the highly dynamic and everchanging business landscape impacted with the pandemic, global geopolitical challenges, there is a high risk of impact on the Tata Steel supply chain and increased risk for disruption. While Tata Steel has always worked on localisation, in FY 2020-21 Tata Steel has increased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatutory\n\nReports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic Supplier Meet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe e/fforts and focus on indigenisation and localisation across multiple categories of buy like raw material spares, and process consumables. A detailed roadmap for indigenisation has been created for the next three years.\n\n## Vendor development\n\nThe vendor development programme and vendor capability advancement programme aims to partner and support suppliers to enhance their capability through continuous improvement, creating a competitive vendor base across Tata Steel. During FY 2020-21, we initiated 32 vendor development programmes, which led to improving vendor capability through a structured approach, value creation and operational improvements in productivity, plant availability, reduction of rework, improved delivery compliance and higher quality of supplies. Moreover, the safety performance of suppliers also improved. Vendor capability and skill development training programmes in TQM, /finance, speci/fic trade-related skill development, operational excellence, ethics, safety, cost management and sustainability covered 844 suppliers. Over 12,000 contracted workforce were trained under the skill certi/fication programme by the Capability Development team.\n\nWe have reached a 100% certi/fied contracted workforce through our skill certi/fication programmes. Skilling 2.0 was initiated in FY 2020-21 focussing on developing a multi-skill workforce. Further, to support local communities and encourage the inclusion of marginalised sections of the society, we help develop entrepreneurial capabilities by creating positive di/fferentiation through our A/ffirmative Action (AA) programme. Nearly 33% of our supply chain partners are local, of which 71 are AA suppliers and DP vendors (displaced due to green/field project).\n\nDuring FY 2020-21, we ensured continuity of vendor operations through necessary interventions across states. We also  ensured that no pay cut was instituted by the local service providers and the contract workforce was paid as per agreed terms. Assistance was provided to vendor partners from across India, by ensuring availability of vehicles, racks and issuing letters for hassle-free transportation.\n\nMany digital initiatives such as Digi-Bill (e-submission of Invoices), digital platform for paperless transactions for inbound material delivery, Margdarshak, for tracking and re-routing vehicles, among others were deployed to manage the supply chain and ease the transactions carried out by our suppliers.\n\n## Way forward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will cover more suppliers under the sustainability assessment programme in FY 2021-22 and then categorise our supplier partners in 5 major bands - Basic, Improving, Established, Mature and Leading. We also intend to identify key ESG risks in supply chain and collaborate with partners for risk mitigation and integrate ESG performance of supply chain partners in procurement decision-making\n\nMore collaborative initiatives on responsible procurement will be undertaken with our key suppliers such as refurbishment of equipment through strategic engagement with MRO vendors and multiple initiatives on reduced carbon emission\n\nWe are actively working on the implementation of innovative and structured /financing solutions such as Receivable Purchase Agreement with major suppliers and ramping up vendor-managed inventory coverage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nGovernance\n\nCapitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Maternal and Newborn Survival Initiative (MANSI) continued to fully support expecting mothers as well as new-born and infants. Healthcare services were available to those with chronic ailments. A lockdown learning model was devised for the Thousand Schools programme for rural children, especially girls facing challenges with access to digital devices and networks, potentially driving increased dropouts and permanent learning disruption. The model equipped volunteer and government school teachers with digital access who then teach children in small COVID-safe clusters using customised teaching learning material thus saturating 90% of children in eight blocks and 60% in 11 blocks. Farming communities were supported to continue their livelihoods.

The Chief Ethics Counsellor has the overall responsibility of driving MBE initiatives and reports to the CEO&MD, who is also the Principal Ethics O/fficer.

These programmes are customised to di/fferent platforms based on the target audience such as leadership team, employees, vendors and contract employees. 'Ethics Month' was organised on the theme, Responsible Me, Responsible We in July 2020.

Policies on Anti-Bribery Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering were released in November 2019. We have put in place an implementation framework through focussed classroom training as well as web-based training. All our policies are accessible through the Ethics Compliance Register- DARPAN on the Company's intranet as well as on the mobile app.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nround-table conferences involving the senior leadership, panel discussions and townhall sessions for employees, webinars for steel processing centres.

Dividend\n\nFor /financial year 2020-21, the Board has recommended a dividend of ' 25/- per fully paid-up Ordinary (equity) Share (previous year: ' 10/- per fully paid-up Ordinary (equity) Share) and in respect of the outstanding partly paid-up Ordinary (equity) Shares of the Company on which call money remains unpaid as on the date of book closure for the dividend payment, the dividend will be paid in proportion to the amount paid-up on such shares i.e. \u20b96.25 per partly paid-up Ordinary (equity) Share of \u20b910/- each (paid-up \u20b92.504 per share) [previous year: ' 2.504 per partly paid-up Ordinary (equity) Share].\n\nThe  Board  has  recommended  dividend  based  on  the parameters laid down in the Dividend Distribution Policy and dividend will be paid out of the pro/fits for the year.\n\nThe dividend on Ordinary Shares (fully paid-up as well as partly paid-up) is subject to the approval of the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting ( 'AGM' ) scheduled to be held on Wednesday, June 30, 2021 and will be paid on and from Friday, July 2, 2021.\n\nBased on the Ordinary Shares (fully paid-up as well as partly paid-up) as on the date of this report, the dividend, if approved would result in a cash out/flow of of \u20b92,996.60 crore. The dividend on Ordinary Shares (fully paid-up as well as partly paid-up) is 250% of the paid-up value of each share. The total dividend pay-out works out to 22% (previous year: 17%) of the net pro/fit (on Standalone basis).\n\nPursuant to the Finance Act, 2020, dividend income is taxable in the hands of the shareholders e/ffective April 1, 2020 and the Company is required to deduct tax at source from dividend paid to the Members at prescribed rates as per the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\nThe Register of Members and Share Transfer Books of the Company will remain closed from Saturday, June 19, 2021 to Wednesday, June 30, 2021 (both days inclusive) for the purpose  of  payment  of  the  dividend  and  AGM  for  the /financial year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n## 3. Transfer to Reserves\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided to retain the entire amount of pro/fit for /financial year 2020-21 in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## 4. Capex and Liquidity\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company, on a consolidated basis,  spent  \u20b96,979  crore  on  capital  projects  across  India, Europe  and  Canada,  largely  towards  essential  sustenance and replacement schemes, while moderating the spend on\n\nongoing growth projects in India (Kalinganagar plant and Tata Steel Mining Limited).\n\nThe Company's liquidity position, on a consolidated basis, is \u20b920,082 crore as on March 31, 2021, comprising \u20b913,113 crore in cash and cash equivalent and balance in undrawn credit lines.\n\n## 5. Management Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe  Management  Discussion  and  Analysis  as  required  in terms of the SEBI Listing Regulations is annexed to the report ( Annexure 2 ).\n\n## B. Integrated Report\n\nIn keeping with the Company's valued tradition of 'thinking about  society  and  not  just  the  business',  in  2016,  we transitioned from compliance based reporting to governance based reporting by adopting the <IR> framework developed by the International Integrated Reporting Council.\n\nOur 6th Integrated Report highlights the measures taken by Company that contributes to long-term sustainability and value creation, while embracing di/fferent skills, continuous innovation, sustainable growth and a better quality of life.\n\n## C. Operations and Performance\n\n## 1. Impact of COVID-19 on operations\n\nThe  outbreak  of  COVID-19  pandemic  has  led  to  an unprecedented  health  crisis  and  has  disrupted  economic activities  and  global  trade,  while  weighing  on  consumer sentiments.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Government of India had imposed stringent nationwide lockdowns, in phases, which severely  impacted  manufacturing  activities.  Though  the Steel and Mining sectors were allowed to operate under the Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1968 they were subject to certain guidelines. Steel demand was a/ffected as key steel consuming sectors struggled to operate amidst weakening economic activities, working capital constraints, shortage of manpower, and logistical issues.\n\nIn Europe, the outbreak of COVID-19 further accentuated the sustained weak steel demand. The share of steel imports to total consumption in the European Union continued to remain at elevated levels which was a cause of concern.\n\nThe risk-intelligent culture embedded across the Company helped in developing and adopting a multi-pronged strategy to e/ffectively respond to the evolving pandemic situation. The health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate continue to be the foremost priority of the Company. To mitigate the risks and challenges faced by the Company during the pandemic, the Company enhanced safety and hygiene norms at o/ffices, implemented work from home, staggered shift timings for safety of employees and",

During the challenging times, the Company maintained its liquidity position by minimising cash out/flows and maintaining a judicious mix of funding instruments to ful/fil its operational requirements.\n\nFurther details on the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's operations, cash /flow, liquidity and pro/fitability as well as the Company's contribution to the community in wake of the pandemic is provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis as annexed to this report.\n\n## 2. Tata Steel Group\n\nDuring  the  year  under  review,  the  Tata  Steel  Group ( 'TSG' ) recorded total deliveries of 28.50 MnT (previous year: 28.88 MnT). The steel deliveries decreased at Tata Steel Europe ( 'TSE' ) and NatSteel Holdings ( 'NSH' ), partly o/ff-set by higher deliveries at Tata Steel BSL Limited ( 'TSBSL' ), Tata Steel Long Products Limited ( 'TSLP' ) and Tata Steel Thailand ( 'TSTH' ). Despite disruptions due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Company contributed to deliveries through higher exports.\n\nThe Company was able to balance deliveries between domestic and  export  markets,  to  counter  pandemic-led  demand disruptions in the Indian steel market in the /first half of the year.\n\nThe turnover of TSG was ' 1,56,294 crore during the /financial year 2020-21 (previous year: ' 1,48,972 crore), an increase of 5% over the previous year primarily contributed by Indian operations on account of higher steel realisations and deliveries. Further, the EBITDA of TSG was ' 30,892 crore, signi/ficantly higher during the /financial year 2020-21 as compared to ' 18,103 crore in the previous year, an increase of ~71% owing to higher revenues, due to increased steel prices, lower input cost, and favourable foreign exchange movement at overseas entities.\n\nDuring the year under review, TSG reported a consolidated pro/fit after tax of ' 8,190 crore which is signi/ficantly higher than the pro/fit of ' 1,172 crore in the previous year. The increase was mainly due to improvement in EBITDA, lower exceptional charge, partly o/ffset by lower interest income at TSE primarily from re/financing activities and higher tax charge in India due to higher pro/fits against deferred tax reversals in the previous year and increase in deferred tax charge at Europe as compared to deferred tax credit in the previous year.\n\n## 3. India\n\nDuring the year under review, total deliveries at Tata Steel Limited (Standalone) were at 12.36 MnT (previous year: 12.32 MnT). Turnover was ' 64,869 crore (previous year: ' 60,436 crore), increase of ~7% than that of the previous year. EBITDA from Tata Steel Limited (Standalone) was ' 21,952 crore (previous year: ' 15,096 crore), 45% higher than that of the previous year.\n\nDuring the year under review, the crude steel production in Tata Steel Limited decreased by 7% to 12.19 MnT mainly owing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto lower production on account of decrease in demand due to the lockdown in Q1FY2021.\n\nTSBSL achieved crude steel production and sales of 4.08 MnT and 4.31 MnT, respectively. This was due to higher exports and improvement in demand in domestic markets in the second half of the year. Despite the nationwide lockdown during /financial year 2020-21, TSBSL's EBITDA stood at ' 5,481 crore, an increase of 131% compared to the previous year. TSBSL also achieved signi/ficant gross debt rationalisation due to improved /financial performance.\n\nTSLP  achieved  crude  steel  production  of  0.65  MnT  while deliveries stood at 0.64 MnT, owing to higher demand and higher availability of /finished goods.\n\nTotal  deliveries  of  Tata  Steel  from  its  Indian  operations (including  TSBSL  and  TSLP)  stood  at  17.31  MnT  which  is marginally  higher  than  the  previous  year.  The  turnover was ' 91,037 crore, an increase by ~11% than previous year and  EBITDA  (excluding  inter-company  eliminations  and adjustments) was ' 28,587 crore, 62% increase than previous year, both owing to increase in steel realisations, higher steel deliveries, and higher sales of by-products and other materials. Moreover, lower operational cost led to improvement in EBDITA.\n\n## 4. Europe\n\nDuring the year under review, liquid steel production from European operations was 9.56 MnT (previous year: 10.26 MnT), a decrease of 7% than previous year. Deliveries from European operations decreased by around 5% to 8.82 MnT primarily due to overall weakness in economic activities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the /first half of the /financial year 2020-21 was challenging for TSE with lower demand and lower selling prices. However, there was strong recovery during the second half of the /financial year 2020-21. Turnover from operations was ' 56,051 crore (previous year: ' 55,939 crore). Despite the headwinds from COVID-19 and higher cost of emission rights, there was improvement in EBITDA due to better control of costs and bene/fits from the transformation programme.\n\n## D. Key Developments\n\n## Amalgamation\n\n## Amalgamation of Bamnipal Steel Limited and Tata Steel BSL Limited into and with Tata Steel Limited\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held on April 25, 2019, approved the amalgamation of Bamnipal Steel Limited and Tata Steel BSL Limited, into and with the Company by way of a composite scheme of amalgamation ( 'Scheme' ).\n\nPursuant  to  the  orders  of  the  Hon'ble  National  Company Law  Tribunal  (' NCLT '),  Mumbai  Bench,  a  meeting  of  the equity  shareholders  was  convened  and  held  on  Friday,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainability\n\nThe Company's philosophy of steel production is deep rooted in the principles of zero harm, resource e/fficiency, circular economy,  minimising  ecological  footprint  and  care  for community and workforce. The sustainability approach of the Company is aligned with its overall vision to be industry leaders in the areas of climate change, water, waste and biodiversity. Underpinning this approach are strategies on low carbon transition, reducing dependence on freshwater consumption, maximising value from waste and exploring opportunities in the circular economy, enhancing biodiversity in the areas where the Company has its operations, building a sustainable and resilient supply chain and customer focussed product stewardship.\n\nThe Company has adopted the UN Sustainable Development Goals ( 'UNSDG' ) and linked it with its long-term strategy and has revised its sustainability targets. Aspirations of taking our carbon emissions to <2tCO 2 /tcs, mitigating dependence on fresh water by lowering speci/fic fresh water consumption to <2m3/tcs, enhancing value proposition on circular economy and scaling up the steel recycling business are signi/ficant facets of this strategy. Tata Steel in Europe aims to decarbonise as required under the European regulations.\n\nThe Company is a signatory to the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures ( 'TCFD' ) for climate change and has identi/fied transition risks and opportunities to decarbonise its operations over a period of time. Speci/fic mitigation and contingency plans for each of the identi/fied risks have been integrated within the Company's long-term strategy. Tata Steel in Europe has embraced a target to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 30% by 2030, compared to 2018, and to achieve carbon neutrality of its steel making operations by 2050.\n\nThe Company had identi/fied supply chain sustainability as a key material issue and in order to take this forward, the Tata Steel Responsible Supply Chain Policy was adopted in February 2020. During the year under review, the Company initiatied the deployment of the Supply Chain Policy through multiple communications across segments of supply chain partners to set the expectations on four important principles of the policy viz. Fair Business Practice, Human Rights, Health and Safety and Environment Protection. Further, the Company also initiated third-party assessment on the compliance of the above mentioned four principles for the critical supply chain partners. During the year under review, the Company also became a member of ResponsibleSteel \u2122 - steel industry's /first global multi-stakeholder standard and certi/fication initiative.\n\nThe Company is committed to serving its customers through a portfolio of eco-friendly products and disclosure of the\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "environmental  impact  of  its  products  by  using  Life  Cycle Assessment  ( 'LCA' )  methodology.  During  the  year  under review, the Company conducted a comparative LCA study for a steel intensive construction structure - HabiNest, that has a functionally similar conventional structure and published a  whitepaper  on  the  superior  environmental  footprint  of HabiNest.  The  Company  also  collaborated  with  CII  Green Business Centre for developing the GreenPro standard for Steel Rebars.\n\nIn Europe, almost the entire product range is certi/fied to be at the BES 6001 sustainable sourcing standard. Tata Steel Europe has also published Environmental Product Declarations ( 'EPD' ), setting  out  the  environmental  characteristics  of  products throughout their life-cycle, for a large number of its products manufactured  in  Europe.  The  Company  has  developed  a tool to assess the sustainability of all new products against the products they replace, in a semi-quantitative manner. The Sustainability Assessment Pro/filer is a unique framework supporting the Company's mission to become sustainable in every sense, creates value propositions related to sustainability and supports customer engagement. The framework considers environmental, social and economic aspects over the complete product life cycle in a consistent manner in an approach that puts the Group ahead of other international steel companies. The Sustainability Assessment Pro/filer achieved recognition in Tata Group's /flagship innovation platform, winning the 2020 Innovista award in the Implemented Innovation category.\n\nIn order to augment the e/fforts of the Company to conserve biodiversity at its operational sites in India, the Company has constituted a Centre of Excellence for Biodiversity Management to  strategically  formulate  and  implement  Biodiversity Management Plans ( 'BMPs' ). During the year under review, the  Company  planted  more  than  2.98  lakh  of  native  tree saplings across locations, reclaimed 100-hectares Pundi dump at West Bokaro to create Sir Dorabji Tata Biodiversity Park and developed a 12-hectares Ecological Importance Park on municipal solid waste dump site at Jamshedpur.\n\nThe  continued  focus  on  'Sustainability'  has  led  Tata Steel  Limited  and  Tata  Steel  Europe,  to  be  recognised  as Sustainability Champions by World Steel Association for four consecutive years. The Company ranked amongst the top 5 global steel companies in Dow Jones Sustainability Indices ( 'DJSI' ) Corporate Sustainability Assessment 2020 and retained its position in the DJSI Emerging Markets Index for the 9th year in a row. The Company also received dual recognition at the 14th edition of CII National Award for Excellence in Water Management 2020 for its continuous e/fforts and commitment to water sustainability. Also, Tata Steel's Plant at Jamshedpur was awarded the 'Most Sustainable Company' award by Indian Institute of Metals in the integrated steel plant category.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Company has not only adopted environment-friendly processes  and  deployed  state-of-the-art  digital  real-time monitoring system to monitor its stack emissions, air and e/ffluent quality, but it is also leveraging technology to enhance environmental responsiveness. The Company continues to be amongst the top global steel industries in environmental sustainability, climate and water disclosures.\n\nThe Company is committed to responsible use and protection of  environment  through  resource  conservation,  pollution control, and sustainable practices for waste management. The Company focusses on operational excellence through 'Reduce, Reuse, Recover and Recycle ' approach. The Company continues its pursuit of establishing best-in-class facilities and channelising its investment to upgrade manufacturing and distribution facilities to improve operational and environmental performance. The Company maintains accredited laboratories for environmental performance assessment.\n\nThe  Company  has  implemented  environment,  health  and safety management system in accordance with international standards  ISO  14001  and  ISO  45001,  which  provides  the necessary framework for managing compliance and improving environmental performance.\n\nThe Safety, Health, & Environment Committee of the Board provides oversight and necessary guidance on environmental matters. The  Company  has  dedicated  Environment Management teams at all its operating locations, globally. The Company endeavours to practice responsible advocacy on regulatory issues and actively participates in various national and international organisations on diverse issues.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company achieved Indian benchmark /figures in CO 2 emission intensity, speci/fic stack dust emissions and speci/fic water consumption. The Company endeavours to set steel industry benchmark in environmental performance. In Europe, the Company launched Roadmap+ in  December  2020,  a  large-scale  investment  programme worth  ~\u20ac300  million  intended  to  improve  environmental performance at its IJmuiden steelworks between 2020 and 2030 by addressing the concerns of the surrounding community on areas such as dust, noise and odours. This represents a further development and deployment of the original Roadmap 2030, launched in 2019.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing issue the world faces today and the Company recognises its obligation to work towards mitigation of climate change related risks and strives to reduce its carbon footprint across all geographies.",

In India, the Company has successfully reduced its carbon footprint by over 25% in the last /fifteen years by improving resource e/fficiency and adoption of best available technologies and strives to achieve carbon emission intensity of <2tCO 2 /tcs by 2025.\n\nThe Company has in place its long-term decarbonisation plan and is in the process of deployment of key enablers for deep decarbonisation including use of more scrap in steelmaking, fuel switching from oil and coal to natural gas, innovating in alternative reductants such as biomass and hydrogen and, to address residual carbon emissions, the deployment of carbon capture, use and storage ( 'CCUS' ) technologies as and when they become technically and commercially viable.\n\nClimate-related risks have in recent years become central to Tata Steel Europe's ( 'TSE' ) risk management process. This includes climate-related physical risks such as those linked to rising sea levels and extreme weather events (e.g. storms, /flooding, droughts, severe winds), and transition risks which include technological, policy and market changes to adapt to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nFor the steel industry, transition risks include increased unit costs within Emissions Trading Systems (both UK and EU) and a reduction in the free allocation of CO 2 allowances under those schemes. In addition, steel producers in the Netherlands are subject to Netherlands' speci/fic carbon tax which, under certain conditions, may come on top of any EU Emissions Trading Systems costs.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing the steel sector is the ambition to move towards low carbon steelmaking with key stakeholders putting pressure on the industry to make a step change in CO 2 emissions.\n\nTata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands ( 'TSN' ) are working in partnership with governments on the shared objective of creating an achievable, long-term plan to support the steel sector's transition to a competitive, sustainable and low carbon future.\n\nIn Europe, together with the Dutch Government, TSN has laid out its CO 2 reduction ambitions through an Expression of Principles document in which it has further re/fined its plans for decarbonisation to support the goals under the Dutch Climate Agreement. TSN is considering multiple technological and operating options in order to achieve these ambitions, and is in discussion with the government, regulators and other stakeholders.\n\nIn  the  UK,  the  Government  published  its  Industrial Decarbonization Strategy in March 2021, the stated aim of which is to create a thriving industrial sector aligned with the net zero target, without pushing emissions and business abroad, with the costs and risks shared fairly between industry,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nits customers and the taxpayer. The strategy also includes certain funding to undertake engineering and design studies for industrial decarbonisation 'clusters', including in South Wales, where Tata Steel's blast furnaces are located.\n\nThe Company is committed towards alignment with TCFD Framework for Climate Change related Risk and Opportunity assessment  and  mitigation.  Recognition  of  TSG  by  CDP in  Leadership  Band  (A-)  for  the  climate  and  supply  chain disclosures  is  testimony  of  the  Company's  long-term commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nHealth  and  Safety  Management  remains  the  Company's foremost priority and we are committed to achieve 'Zero Harm'. In pursuit of this objective, the Company continues to work on six strategies viz. build safety leadership capability at all levels to achieve zero harm, achieve zero harm to contract employees by strengthening deployment of contractor safety management standard, improve competency and capability for hazard identi/fication & risk management, improve road & rail safety across the Company, excellence in process safety management, and establish industrial hygiene and improve occupational health.\n\nDuring  the  year  under  review,  the  Company  undertook proactive measures to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  on  the  Company's  workforce  through  agile decision-making and timely deployment of several policies and  measures  for  the  bene/fit  of  the  employees.  A  novel initiative,  the  'POD  concept',  was  implemented  to  tackle the spread of COVID-19 within the Company premises. Selfsu/fficient  groups  of  people  having  self-contained  set  of skills to do an intended job have been formed and deployed at manufacturing and raw material locations as well as at pro/fit centres.\n\nThe Company took several initiatives to improve the health and safety standards of its employees, including rolling out a reward and recognition policy for Indian operations to encourage positive safety behaviour among employees. Further, to boost employee morale during the pandemic situation, the Company organised the 'SHE Excellence Award' on virtual platform, recognizing and rewarding employees / departments for their remarkable contribution towards maintaining 'safety' within the Company.\n\nThe  Company  took  initiative  to  enhance  the  competency of the workforce and provided safety training at the Safety Leadership Development Centre formed by the Company. For e/ffective learning and deployment of Safety Standards across organisation, 14 Safety Standards were simpli/fied and e-learning  modules  were  developed.  The  Company  took several e/fforts in training the majority workforce in simpli/fied safety standards through these e-modules. The Company's e/fforts were recognised through the 'Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award 2020'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Contractor's safety has always been a priority for the Company. During the year under review, the Company provided state-ofthe-art health check-up facility for its contractual employees at Jamshedpur, India.\n\nFurther, the initiative to roll out Process Safety through 'Centre of Excellence' methodology gained momentum. Currently, the process safety has been rolled out to 74 departments across locations as well as amongst Tata Steel Group Companies. The  Company  has  been  awarded  for  its  best  practice  in 'Digitalization of Process Safety Performance Indicators' by the World Steel Association under Safety & Health Excellence Recognition 2020.\n\nFurther,  the  Company  has  taken  initiatives  in  leveraging digital technology in the /field of health and safety through digitalisation of dashboard for e/ffective control of Process Safety  Performance  Indicators  and  developing  of  Smart Signaling System for the railway tracks to avoid derailment at its plant locations in Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar.\n\nTowards Occupational Health, the Company has implemented Industrial Hygiene hazard control measures to minimise the exposure level at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar. Ergonomic control measures were taken across Jamshedpur and other raw material locations to achieve the best mutual adjustment of man and his work environment. Further, in order to develop competency in First Aid and CPR for emergency situations, 5,325 employees were trained across India. High risk cases of about 56%, relating to life style diseases, have been transformed to moderate or low risk category, through the Company's themebased health awareness campaigns and Wellness@workplace programme.\n\nEmployees'  fatality  remains  the  topmost  safety  concern for the Company. It is with deep regret that we report four fatalities in TSG. During the year under review, two distinct Safety campaigns viz. 'Slip/trip/fall' and 'Moving Machinery Risk  perception  &  Risk  elimination'  were  launched  across locations  to  address  gaps  and  improve  safety  awareness. Monthly review of red risk incidents by senior leadership helped  in  achieving  ~61%  reduction  of  red  risk  incidents vis-\u00e0-vis previous year. Deployment of various safety initiatives has helped in achieving ~25% reduction in 'Lost-Time-Injury' cases and ~17% reduction in /first-aid cases vis-\u00e0-vis previous year.\n\nAt Tata Steel Europe, health and safety continues to be of utmost priority. In a year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company responded with pace and with a coordinated agile approach in order to protect the health and well-being of all employees and stakeholders. This resulted in those who could work from home doing so, supported by the appropriate tools, systems, policies and guidelines in line with national requirements.  Employees  in  the  manufacturing  processes continued to operate successfully with new social distancing\n\nrules and procedures in place. E/ffective communication and engagement was key to maintain safe and healthy working environment and to recognise the challenges to employees physical health, mental health and well-being throughout the year. With this backdrop, the overall safety performance of the Company improved and the Company reported no fatalities in Europe during the year.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nIn line with the aspiration to be amongst the top innovation and technology driven steel companies globally, the Company continues  to  strengthen  its  Technology  Leadership  Areas ( 'TLAs' ). Cross functional teams have been constituted and projects have commenced based on TLAs. During the year under review, the Research and Development ( 'R&D' ) team of the Company has developed an arti/ficial neural network based model to predict the mechanical properties of various steel grades rolled in Thin Slab Casting and Rolling ( 'TSCR' ) plant of Tata Steel, at Jamshedpur. This system assures continuous quality maintainence of the coils rolled in TSCR.\n\nIn order to utilise and generate value from the captive low grade raw materials, R&D team has completed the lab scale studies to utilise captive Low-Grade Manganese Ore and produce high value products such as Electrolytic Manganese Metal and High Purity Manganese Sulphate to cater to the requirements of the 'battery' manufacturing industry. The Company is under process to set up a pilot plant to upscale this process.\n\nConservation of the environment and sustainability has always been an important area for the Company.

The Company follows coordinated risk assurance and the ERM process is integrated with Corporate Audit, Strategy & Business Planning, Corporate Legal and Compliance functions. This brings further rigour in driving the ERM process across the organisation as well as across several TSG companies. An in-house built IT system has been deployed across the organisation to enable recording and review of risks through live dashboards and real-time monitoring of data.\n\nThe Risk oversight function consists of the Board of Directors, Risk Management Committee ( 'RMC' ), and Group Risk Review Committee ( 'GRRC' ) to oversee the risk management policy and provide guidelines for implementing the ERM framework and ERM process across the Company and develop a risk intelligent culture within the organisation. The RMC, amongst others, reviews the key risks, progress of ERM implementation across locations and challenges faced.

The team is led by Group Head - Corporate Finance & Risk Management who acts as the Chief Risk O/fficer ( 'CRO' ) of the Company. The ERM team scans the external environment for developments which may throw up risks for the organisation and  risk  /flags  are  sent  out  to  the  Business  Units  ( 'BU' ). BUs engage in identi/fication and management of bottomup risks, which are periodically reviewed as per de/fined ERM process. The risks are escalated and aggregated for reporting to GRRC and RMC. This is complemented by a top-down process, which helps in identi/fication of strategic and enterprise level risks.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company undertook a Risk Maturity Assessment through an external partner to assess the maturity of the ERM process. The Board is pleased to report that with a score of 4.63 on a scale of 5, the Company has been recognised to be ahead in the risk maturity curve compared to its peers in mining & metal sector and marginally behind the highest scoring organisations (across sectors).\n\nThe Company's risk intelligent culture enabled it to manage the uncertainties in an unprecedented business environment during  the  year  under  review.  As  the  COVID-19  situation evolved,  'scenario-based  risk  assessment'  was  facilitated across the Company. Further, business decisions were pivoted to achieve cash neutrality in operations by reducing spend, managing working capital and reducing capital expenditures. Operating regime was recalibrated in response to the decline in domestic demand. Supply chain disruptions were managed through obtaining necessary licenses to ensure movement of raw materials and /finished goods.

Overview\n\nThe objective of this report is to convey the Management's perspective on the external environment and steel industry, as  well  as  strategy,  operating  and  /financial  performance, material developments in human resources and industrial relations, risks and opportunities and internal control systems and their adequacy in the Company during the /financial year 2020-21. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company's  /financial  statements,  the  schedules  and  notes thereto  and  other  information  included  elsewhere  in  the Integrated Report. The Company's /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards ( 'Ind AS' ) complying with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, ( 'Act' ) and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( 'SEBI' ), each as amended from time to time.\n\n## II. External Environment\n\n## 1. Macroeconomic condition\n\nGlobal GDP contracted by 3.5% in 2020 as governments in both developed and emerging economies took measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. While the decline was sharper than the global /financial crisis in 2009, but the scale of the /fiscal response to the COVID-19 crisis was unprecedented and three times bigger than 2008-09 /financial crisis. The response by policy makers prevented a collapse that would have been at least three times worse, and the medium-term losses for the global economy are expected to be smaller than the global /financial crisis.\n\nWhile China is forecasted to continue its rapid growth in 2021, Latin America and the Eurozone is expected to lag behind. US saw overall GDP decline of 3.5%. India's economy rebounded quickly from one of the world's longest and most stringent lockdowns,  which  also  came  with  steepest  fall  in  GDP  in Q2. Real GDP grew by 0.4% in Q3FY2021 after a contraction in the previous two quarters. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by ~8% in FY 2020-21.\n\n## 2. Economic Outlook\n\nThe  accelerating  rollout  of  COVID-19  vaccines  in  many advanced economies has set the stage for rapid recovery in the second half of this year and into 2022. Advanced economies will remain less a/ffected by the virus this year and beyond, with low-income countries and emerging markets su/ffering more which is a contrast to 2009. While, the global economy is expected to recover to its pre-pandemic level of output in 2022,\n\nthe emerging-market and developing economies are expected to take until 2023 to recover to the pre-pandemic level.\n\nPolicy rates in the United States, Eurozone, United Kingdom, and Japan will remain near zero, well beyond 2021. Emergingmarket and developing economies may take until 2023 to recover to the pre-pandemic level. Divergent recovery paths are  likely  to  create  wider  gaps  in  living  standards  across countries compared to pre-pandemic expectations.\n\n## 3. Indian Economy\n\nIndia witnessed a gradual resumption of economic activity from Q2FY2021. The initial recovery was driven by government spending on infrastructure, exports and rural economy. The recovery gained momentum since August 2020 with pickup in consumption demand driven by festive buying and return of urban consumption. However, the growth projections for FY 2021-22 have been revised to be below 11% due to the acute resurgence of the virus in the country, as many cities and states went into lockdown. While the growth will depend upon the trajectory of the pandemic, the overall impact on the economy is expected to be less severe than last year.\n\nIndia  is  expected  to  witness  a  full  economic  recovery  in H2FY2022 driven by (a) ongoing vaccination supporting the current recovery momentum; (b) restart of investment cycle with signi/ficant spending on infrastructure and (c) continued recovery  in  consumption  supported  by  urban  demand, accentuated by work-from-home and preferences for personal mobility  along  with  rising  rural  income  and  a/ffordability. However, normal growth levels would be seen in FY 2022-23 only, provided no further economic disruption occurs and success of the ongoing vaccination drive.\n\n## III. Steel Industry\n\n## 1. Global Steel Industry\n\nDisruption on both demand and supply resulted in global steel demand in 2020 to fall by 0.2% against a growth of 3.7% in 2019. The total demand in 2020 was 1,772 MnT against 1,775 MnT in 2019. The impact of COVID-19 has been much more benign for the steel industry due to resurgent demand in China and better than expected post lockdown recovery globally in second half of 2020. China and Turkey were two key countries that saw an increase in /finished steel demand of 9% and 13% respectively in 2020. North America and the European Union ( 'EU' ) have experienced strong decline in steel demand owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both regions experienced demand decline of around 11%-16%. India also contributed to global decline, as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "steel consumption in India declined by 13.7% to 88.5 MnT in 2020 against 102.6 MnT in 2019.\n\nUp to 30% of global steelmaking capacity (excluding China) was idled or production at steel mills signi/ficantly reduced in response to a pandemic-induced drop in demand. However, the  recovery  in  automotive  production  and  white  goods manufacturing was quicker than expected when the strictest lockdown measures were lifted. The construction sector was less a/ffected, as it was supported by government stimulus schemes in many regions. As a result, steel prices rallied in all regions in late 2020.\n\n## 2. Outlook for steel industry\n\nSteel demand is expected to be strong due to recovery in manufacturing businesses around the world and global /fiscal stimulus supporting infrastructure projects. The outlook for 2021 is expected to be positive because of the unprecedented /fiscal stimulus provided by the governments across Europe, the US, Japan, Korea, Russia and China. These stimulus packages are  expected  to  spur  growth  in  these  nation's  respective infrastructure  sectors,  boosting  steel  demand.  China  is expected to grow by 5% in 2021 with continuation of healthy demand conditions especially in the /first half of 2021. Steel demand in key emerging economies (like India, Turkey) and Europe is expected to witness double digit recovery while Asia and Middle-East are likely to grow by 5%.\n\nWhile it is expected that steel prices will consolidate closer to historical levels, prices are likely to remain high supported by (i) strong iron ore prices, (ii) rebound in coking coal prices, (iii) positive impact from stimulus plans, and (iv) improved business  con/fidence  from  the  roll-out  of  vaccines.  Strong rebound of demand in 2021, in addition to supply-side reforms in China could lead to higher steel prices globally.\n\nPolitical and geopolitical developments, such as a reduction in government stimulus programmes, policies to cut emissions and trade wars, could increase pressure on the steel sector.\n\n## 3. Indian Steel Industry\n\nIndia's steel industry has also su/ffered the production loss due  to  lockdown  last  year  and  recovered  gradually  since then, initially driven by export followed by gradual recovery in domestic demand. Strong rebound in manufacturing and infrastructure development activity has led to a sharp rise in both production and consumption of steel in India. In 2021, India's steel demand is expected to grow by 20% over 2020, taking the demand higher than the pre-pandemic level of 103 MnT, driven by strong infrastructure spending and sustained demand of automotive and consumer durables.\n\nThe  key  opportunities  boosting  the  steel  demand  are  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Government's  focus  on  strengthening  the  domestic manufacturing  base  under  the  /flagship  'Atmanirbhar\n\n- Bharat'  programme.  The  Production  Linked  Incentive scheme has been introduced to boost the manufacturing sector in industries like automobile & auto components, consumer durables, solar equipment, telecom, etc. These are expected to boost steel consumption.\n- \u00b7 Government  has  announced  an  investment  of  over  \u20b91 trillion in infrastructure over the next 5 years. This would be a key growth driver not only for steel industry but will also be a multiplier of growth across the sectors, boosting steel demand from sectors such as transportation, real estate and infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Emergence  of  new  trends  after  COVID-19  such  as  work from home, preference to physical distancing would create additional demand for furniture, personal mobility, etc. In addition, the rise in e-commerce activity will support the growth of warehousing and light commercial vehicles.\n\nHowever, the downside to these opportunities are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Resurgence of infections leading to fresh lockdowns, both localised as well as regional / national level resulting in disruption in economic activity.\n- \u00b7 Heavy dependence of agriculture sector on monsoon. In last 2 years, a normal monsoon has supported the growth in agriculture sector.\n- \u00b7 Slower  recovery  in  contact-based  services,  which  is an  integral  part  of  Indian  economy  and  a/ffects  lives  & livelihood of service sector.\n\n## IV. Operational Performance\n\n## 1. Tata Steel Group\n\nDuring the year under review, the consolidated steel production for  Tata  Steel  Group  ( 'TSG' )  was  28.54  MnT  recording  a 7% decrease over that of the previous year, primarily due to disruptions arising out of COVID-19. TSG recorded total deliveries of 28.50 MnT as against 28.88 MnT in the previous year which was marginally lower by 1%. The steel deliveries decreased at Tata Steel Europe by 5% and at NatSteel Holdings by 25% due to lower demand. This decrease was o/ff-set by higher deliveries at Tata Steel BSL Limited ( 'TSBSL' ) by 4%. Further, deliveries at Tata Steel Long Products Limited (formerly Tata Sponge Iron Limited) increased by 25% and at Tata Steel Thailand by 9% due to higher availability of /finished products and higher demand. The deliveries at Tata Steel (Standalone) were at par, despite disruptions arising out of COVID-19.\n\nThe  turnover  of  TSG  was  at  \u20b91,56,294  crore  during FY 2020-21, an increase of 5% over the previous /financial year due to increase in realisations across geographies, partly o/ffset by marginal decline in deliveries.\n\nThe  EBITDA  of  TSG  was  \u20b930,892  crore  during  the FY 2020-21 as compared to \u20b918,103 crore in the previous year",

The increase was mainly due to higher operating pro/fits  attributable  to  increase  in  the  steel  prices  across geographies during FY 2020-21 along with lower cost and lower exceptional charge as compared to that of the previous year, partly o/ffset by higher tax expenses mainly at Tata Steel (Standalone) due to higher pro/fits. Moreover, the previous year included re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower rate of Income tax prescribed under Section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 along with creation of deferred tax assets at some of the foreign entities as against creation of deferred tax liabilities during the current /fiscal primarily at Tata Steel Europe.\n\n## 2.

The hot metal production stood at 13.24 MnT which is ~6% lower than that of previous year as the plant operated at lower levels due to nation-wide COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n## i) Tata Steel Jamshedpur\n\nDuring the year under review, Tata Steel Jamshedpur ( 'TSJ' ) had produced crude steel of 9.34 MnT, lower than 10.19 MnT produced during FY 2019-20 due to COVID-19 lockdowns and business disruption. During FY 2020-21, there have been certain operational improvements such as increase in agglomerate consumption,  lower  consumption  of  ferro  alloys,  lime, refractories and speci/fic energy. The Company has continuous operational improvement programmes through Shikhar 25, which is a focused EBIDTA improvement programme which works across departments of Tata Steel to improve operational e/fficiency,  lower  costs,  optimise  product  mix,  reduce  and recycle waste and energy e/fficiency.\n\n## ii) Tata Steel Kalinganagar\n\nDuring the year under review, Tata Steel Kalinganagar ( 'TSK' ) had produced lower crude steel of 2.85 MnT as against 2.96 MnT in previous year, due to COVID-19 lockdowns and business interruptions. During the year under review, TSK achieved best ever power generation in house, captive power plant and Coke Dry Quenching power thereby reducing the purchased power requirement. The product mix in FY 2020-21 comprised low carbon, medium & high carbon, IF and peritectic micro alloy grades, which served di/fferent market segments such as LPG, Tube making, Tin plating, Construction & Projects, Lifting and Excavation, Automotives, Heavy Engineering, etc.\n\nTSK has embarked upon second phase of expansion which will take its production capacity to 8 MnT per annum. Pellet Plant and Cold Rolling Mill ( 'CRM' ) construction activities have gained momentum including the augmentation of raw material handling facilities.\n\nTSK ensures better socio-economic development of the people in the peripheral areas of its operations, focusing on health, education,  infrastructure  development,  livelihoods,  skill upgradation and women empowerment among others.\n\n## b) Marketing and Sales Initiatives\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company recorded sales of 12.36 MnT, which is marginally higher over the previous year. This increase is attributable to higher ex ports during the beginning of the /financial year to combat the adverse impact of COVID-19 and nation-wide lockdown. Demand started to pick up from the second half of the /financial year.\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the onset of the festive season in September 2020 brought signi/ficant uptick in demand also supported by the need for personal mobility in pandemic times. The impressive revival in demand in H2FY2021 ensured that the sector ended the year with a de-growth of only 11% and 18% in PV and CV respectively (Y-o-Y). Tata Steel registered annual sales of 1.57 MnT with an increase in market share over FY 2019-20 across all products (including outer skin panel, high tensile steel segment). The year ended with an overall market share of 43% as against 35% in FY 2019-20 on standalone basis. Tata Steel continues to command market leadership with high SOB (Share of Business) in all new model launches including entry into import intensive OEMs.\n\nTata Steel continues to be a di/fferentiator through its o/fferings to automotive customers amidst changing business realities including an enhanced focus on ancillary space by bringing in corporate level focus in large ancillaries, solution oriented o/fferings and broadening supply chain capabilities through new processing partners. It has helped us improve the sales experience of our customers when they do business with us. Also, the launch of a /first of its kind digital VAVE (Value Analysis &  Value  Engineering)  platform  'e-DRIVE'  helped  take  our customer engagement to a new level in these tough times.\n\nBranded Products and Retail: During the year under review, Branded Products sales was 3.42 MnT (38% of total domestic sales of FY 2020-21).\n\nThe  B2C  segment  achieved  sales  volume  of  1.51  MnT  in FY 2020-21. Tata Shaktee achieved a sales growth of ~4% over FY 2019-20 with a volume of 190kT from TSJ against 183 kT in FY  2019-20,  with  the  scale  up  of  new  products  such  as WAMA (for walling application) and Long Length GC sheets contributing to the increase in sales. Tata KOSH has achieved\n\nsales of 27 kT in FY 2020-21, despite COVID-19 led disruptions. In addition, TSBSL integration led to 27 kT (11% of Total Sales) of Tata Shaktee Sales and 43kT (61% of total Sales) of Tata Kosh sales through the Company's channel in FY 2020-21.\n\nIn  FY  2020-21,  B2ECA  (Business  to  Emerging  Corporate Accounts) business clocked a volume of 1.91 MnT and in the process serviced 9,000+ customers. Value Added Products contributed 24% of overall ECA Volumes. This was achieved through  market  development  and  access  to  key  micro segments (Railways, Wagons, Transmission Line Tower, PEB, Solar, Appliances) and introduction of segment speci/fic 41 new products. ECA business launched 3 New Coated Brands from Tata Steel BSL 'GalvaRoS, Galvanova and Colornova' for entry into new product and market segments like Appliances, Solar, Commercial Building. The New Coated Brands promote sustainability in line with the changing consumer requirements. DigEca,  a  digital  solution  for  ECA  business,  has  created real-time, segmental visibility of sales by channel partners to ECA customers.\n\nIndustrial  Products,  Projects  and  Exports: The  vertical registered a strong performance on the back of exports in H1FY2021  and  recovery  in  Construction,  Engineering  and Valued Added segments in H2FY2021 resulting in sales of 6.46 MnT for the year (~6% growth Y-o-Y).\n\nTata Steel continued its focus on Engineering segments and Value-Added Products ( 'VAP' ) through an enriched product portfolio. Precision Tubes segment grew by 12% Y-o-Y from 107 kT to 120 kT registering the highest ever sales in any /fiscal year. Despite the impact of the pandemic, sales in MCHC (Medium Carbon / High Carbon) and LPG segment also grew marginally over FY 2019-20. Sales of high strength and corrosion resistant rebars together grew by 39% Y-o-Y. Engineering Segment also achieved best ever sales with a growth of 5% Y-o-Y driven by 3.5 times growth in Oil & Gas segment through approvals from major Oil Marketing Companies for API X65 & API X70. The Company increased its market share in Lifting & Excavation segments  with  a  growth  of  14%  Y-o-Y  and  increased  its presence in niche segments comprising of solar, transmission towers, crash barriers and special structural grades with a growth of 58% Y-o-Y. Engineering Segments also increased dispatches through costal route by 25% over last year bringing in cost savings.\n\nIn Construction space, the Company has maintained its focus on o/ffering services and solutions through Cut & Bend with Tiscon Readybuild sales at 106 kT in FY 2020-21. The Company has also supplied ~109 kT rebars (~11% of total project sales) to 29 Marquee projects in India.\n\nSteel exports in FY 2020-21 increased to ~2.41 MnT to combat the pandemic a/ffected H1FY2021 and contributed to ~20% of Tata Steel sales. In order to maximise exports, the Company started using two more ports (Kolkata & Vishakhapatnam)",

The decrease in production at TSBSL is due to slowdown in the activities and operations due to the pandemic.\n\nThe extra-ordinary performance of TSBSL during the year, including increase in revenue by 18% and in EBITDA by 131% Y-o-Y was driven by increase in deliveries and improvement in  realisations.  Higher  profits  in  line  with  increase  in operating  profits  along  with  lower  finance  cost  due  to pre-payments, earned free cash/flow of 1.25 times of EBITDA which further led to signi/ficant gross debt rationalisation.\n\nPost acquisition, many improvement projects have been were undertaken at TSBSL for optimum sweating of all the assets and to reach higher level of capacity utilisation. Value creation through synergy initiatives were undertaken jointly by technical and quality teams of Tata Steel Limited and TSBSL which are as under:\n\n## Operational Excellence: Be1 Programme\n\nThe Be1 Programme - the /flagship multi-dimensional excellence programme driving operational, commercial, /financial and capability excellence continued in its 3rd year at the Company. Despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme has  been  expanded  to  26  operational  impact  centres  in",

This was enabled  by  building  a  robust  pipeline  of  improvement initiatives which will continue to deliver value in FY 2021-22, strengthening the /financial position.\n\nThe idea pipeline was built by conducting idea generation workshops ensuring the engagement of employees across all levels of the organisation. Due to restrictions during the pandemic and lockdown, the primary focus of the initiatives was on cost optimisation and cash conservation, along with throughput de-bottlenecking and value creation for ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\n- \u00b7 Key  initiatives  on  cost  that  drove  value  across  the organisation  include  -  Coking  coal  blend  optimisation, IBRM  (Iron  Bearing  Raw  Materials)  mix  optimisation, e/fficient energy management, raw materials cost optimisation, /fixed cost & working capital rationalisation, contract  consolidations,  alternate  sourcing  of  materials, rail and road network optimisation and various advocacy measures.\n- \u00b7 Key  initiatives  on  throughput  include  de-bottlenecking across upstream units like RMHS (Raw Material Handling System), SMS (Steel Melting Shop), HSM (Hot Strip Mill) etc. and multiple downstream units, maximising the utilisation of  DRI  (Direct  Reduced  Iron)  kilns  (7  kilns  in  operation), reliability improvement  by  horizontal  deployment  of standardised maintenance practices for critical equipment. Besides these, initiatives focused on value creation including customer diversi/fication in multiple segments, ramping up volumes of branded products (including launching of three new brands - ColorNova, GalvaNova, GalvaRos), increasing the sales of VAP (Value Added Products), external sales of DRI and various by-products (1st ever dispatch by rakes).\n\nIn addition, the programme focused on leveraging group synergies with TSG to increase use of captive raw material, optimisation of product mix to maximise system bene/fits, horizontal  deployment  of  best  practices  across  the  value chain, manufacturing of the Company branded products at the plants and leveraging the channel and distribution network of the Company for increasing the share of branded product. The  plant  achieved  multiple  BPDs  (best-demonstratedperformance)  throughout  the  year  across  multiple  cost  & throughput parameters which accelerated the journey towards 5.2 MTPA of crude steel production.\n\nIn addition to these, the journey towards TQM as a way of working has been initiated through the deployment of quality circles for SGA (Small Group Activity), DM (Daily Management) practices and VWM (Visual Workplace Management).\n\nThe organisation has also started deploying multiple Digital Initiatives in the /field of automation, visualisation, simulation and optimisation to create sustainable value. It has developed a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/five year digital roadmap with more than 80 projects identi/fied and several pilot projects have already been deployed. A few key highlights from digital initiatives include the Video Wall project at BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace), Loco Scheduling Optimisation for logistics cost reduction, Metallic Fe-Bearing IMM (Integrated Margin Management) module which led to cost reduction and optimisation.\n\n## Product Development:\n\nHot  Rolled  Product: TSBSL  developed  50CrV4  &  58CrV4 at Angul for replacement of POSCO materials (localisation strategy). In Auto segment, BSK 46 for chassis application and Fe 360 & WIR019 grades for Disc & Rim application were developed for our key customers.\n\n## Cold Rolled and Coated Product:\n\n- \u00b7 CRCA: TSBSL developed and received approval of 10 Skin Panel  grades  for  CV  segment  of  a  leading  automobile customer in Pune. Further development of IF grade CRCA material for two-wheeler rear and front fenders for a leading auto maker was also carried out and commercial supplies of HSLA 340 grade steel having application in commercial vehicle /floor panels was also commenced.\n- \u00b7 Colour  Coated  Products: Developed  colour  coated products  for  body  panels  of  washing  machines  and refrigerators  for  a  few  leading  multinational  companies in  the  appliance  business.  TSBSL  also  developed  colour coated coil brand named Colornova.\n- \u00b7 Tubes  &  Pipes: Propeller  Shaft  Tubes  were  developed and approved for commercial supplies for a leading Auto Manufacturer  and  dent  resistance  ERW  tube  was  also developed.\n- \u00b7 Galvanised  products: Developed  high  strength  GPCS (Galvanised  Plain  Crushed  Spangle)  material  for  PEB (Pre-engineered Building) segment.\n\n## ii) Tata Steel Long Products Limited ('TSLP')\n\nTSLP's  current  product  portfolio  is  unique  in  nature  and complementary to Tata Steel's product basket. It primarily deals in two products viz. DRI (Direct Reduced Iron / Sponge Iron) and Special Steel. DRI on one hand is highly commoditised in nature and used as a raw material (substitute to steel scrap) in the electric arc furnaces or induction furnaces. While on the other hand, Special Steel is used for hi-end and critical applications such as forgings, bearings, fasteners, springs etc. This enabled Tata Steel Limited to complete its o/ffering in the Automotive sector  for  critical  long  products-based  components  apart from being a dominant leader for Flat products-based parts / components.\n\nTSLP,  immediately  after  acquisition  of  Usha  Martin's Steel  business,  had  been  engaged  in  transformation programme.  TSLP  launched  'Shikhar'  (a  multi-divisional,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The programme has generated more than 1,100 ideas and majority of the ideas have been successfully  implemented  resulting  in  total  savings  of ~ \u20b9300 crore.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit / (loss) of TSLP for the /financial year 2020-21 are as follows:\n\n|                                                    | FY 21   | ( '  crore) FY 20   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| Turnover                                           | 4,750   | 3,490               |\n| EBITDA                                             | 1,154   | 184                 |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before exceptional items | 615     | (369)               |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                           | 615     | (530)               |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before exceptional items  | 572     | (355)               |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                            | 572     | (516)               |\n\nThe  Steel  Business  of  Usha  Martin  Ltd.  was  acquired  on April 9, 2019.\n\nThe production and sales performance is given below:\n\n|                |   FY 21 |   FY 20 |   (mn tonnes) Change (%) |\n|----------------|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Crude Steel    |    0.65 |    0.58 |                       11 |\n| Saleable Steel |    0.53 |    0.48 |                       12 |\n| Sales          |    0.64 |    0.51 |                       25 |\n\nDuring the FY 2020-21, TSLP produced 797kt of sponge iron and 648kt of crude steel, higher by 32kt and 63kt respectively due to higher productivity and demand. The deliveries of sponge iron were at 632kt and 639kt of steel. The steel deliveries were higher by 128kt despite disruptions caused by COVID-19 due to increase in demand and higher availability of /finished goods. The turnover of the current year increased by 36% primarily due to higher volumes of steel along with increase in steel and sponge iron prices. TSLP reported Pro/fit Before Tax of \u20b9615 crore as against loss of \u20b9530 crore during the previous year, mainly due to higher operating pro/fits along with lower /finance cost due to pre-payments of loans and lower exceptional charges during the year under review. Previous year included exceptional charge of \u20b9161 crore.\n\n## iii) Tata Steel Europe ('TSE')\n\nEconomic growth in 2020 was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, whilst the impact of the national lockdowns was somewhat mitigated by various forms of government stimulus, global GDP contraction in 2020 was 3.5% down from growth of 2.5% in 2019. In the European Union ( 'EU' ), the economy declined by 6.3% in 2020 compared to growth of 1.5% in 2019 and in the United Kingdom the economy declined by 9.8% compared to growth of 1.4% in 2019. Both services\n\nand manufacturing were negatively impacted by the national lockdowns and although the recovery for manufacturing was relatively quick, the recovery for services has been slower.\n\nDemand for steel in the European Union declined in 2020 by 11.4% compared to a reduction of 5.4% in 2019. The automotive sector was impacted signi/ficantly by national lockdowns in the /first half of 2020 and the production of vehicles came almost to a standstill in April 2020. For the full year, the number of vehicles produced declined by 24.2%. Machinery and construction were also impacted by the pandemic and output declined by 12.3% and 4.4% respectively. Nevertheless, European steel spot prices, based on Hot Rolled Coil ( 'HRC' ) in Germany (parity point), improved during the year to \u20ac534/t, an increase of \u20ac65/t. The increase was driven by higher demand in the second half of the /financial year whilst supply was limited. In 2021 global economic growth is expected to be high as COVID-19 restrictions are eased. The World Steel Association predicts that growth of global steel demand will recover to 5.8% with EU steel demand expected to recover by 10.2%.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit / (loss) /figures of TSE (continuing operations) are given below:\n\n|                                                    | FY 21   | ( '  crore) FY 20   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| Turnover                                           |         | 56,051 55,939       |\n| EBITDA                                             | (618)   | (664)               |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before exceptional items |         | (4,565) (5,012)     |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                           | (5,907) | 9,837               |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before exceptional items  |         | (6,155) (3,511)     |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                            | (7,497) | 11,337              |\n\nThe production and sales performance of TSE (continuing operations) is given below:\n\n|                         |   FY 21 |   FY 20 | (mn tonnes) Change (%)   |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Liquid Steel Production |    9.55 |   10.26 | (7)                      |\n| Deliveries              |    8.82 |    9.29 | (5)                      |\n\nTSE's production in the FY 2020-21 was down 0.7 MnT (7%) compared to the previous year due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on demand for the Group's steel products. The deliveries were lower by 5% over the previous year.\n\nDuring the year under review, the revenue was at \u20b956,051 crore, almost at par as the decrease in revenue from that of previous year was due to decline in deliveries by 469kt along with marginal decrease in average revenue per tonne caused by lower prices and less favourable sales mix attributable to the impact of COVID-19 during the /first half of the year, was almost o/ffset by favourable exchange impact on translation. In the second half of the /financial year, demand increased back to pre-COVID-19 levels and selling prices in the fourth",

Despite the headwinds from COVID-19 and the higher cost of emission rights, EBITDA improved due to tight control of costs and bene/fits from the transformation programme along with government employment cost support of \u00a361m. The pro/fit before tax in FY 2020-21 was signi/ficantly lower primarily on account of gain from interest waiver of \u00a31.12 billion (\u20b910,088 crore) on the waived inter-company loan of \u00a30.77 billion (\u20b96,981 crore) due to restructuring of inter-company debt during the second quarter of FY 2019-20. However, the same was eliminated on consolidation in the group accounts. Exceptional charge mainly on impairment of PPE was lower than that of the previous year.\n\nThe principal activities of TSE in FY 2020-21 comprised the manufacture  and  sale  of  steel  products.  TSE's  operations produced  carbon  steel  by  the  basic  oxygen  steelmaking method at its integrated steelworks in the Netherlands at IJmuiden and in the UK at Port Talbot. During FY 2020-21, these plants produced 9.6 MnT (previous year: 10.3 MnT) of liquid steel. Whilst TSE seeks to increase its di/fferentiated / premium business, which is less dependent on market price movements, it still retains focus in both the UK and Netherlands on improving its operations, consistency, and taking measures to  protect  against  unplanned  interruptions  and  property damage.\n\nStrip Products Mainland Europe Liquid steel production at  IJmuiden  Steel  Works,  Netherlands  during  2020-21  at 6.2mt was 0.6mt lower than the previous year re/flecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the /first half of the /financial year. During 2020-21, Strip Products Mainland Europe continued with the transformation programme which is targeting improvements to delivery and yield performance, commercial mix, and reducing operating costs and unplanned downtime.  Further  progress  -  albeit  at  a  slower  than anticipated pace due to COVID-19 also achieved in its 'Strategic Asset Roadmap' capital investment programme to support the strategic growth of di/fferentiated, high value products in the automotive, lifting and excavating, and energy and power market sectors. In December 2020, the 'Roadmap Plus' was launched, which contains a series of measures to eliminate the environmental impact (noise, dust, odour) of Strip Products Mainland Europe. It includes a set of new measures, but also an acceleration of the measures which were announced in 2019 as part of the 'Roadmap 2030'.\n\nStrip Products UK Liquid steel production at Port Talbot Steel Works, Wales during the FY 2020-21 at 3.4mt was 0.1mt lower than the previous year impacted by demand reductions in the /first half of the year associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although restricted by the disruption seen during the year, the transformation programme continued with further Y-o-Y bene/fits  adding  to  the  signi/ficant  improvements  in  prior\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyears. Building upon the work of 'Sustainable Operational Excellence' Strip Products UK broke a number of operational records during 2020-21, not limited to daily, shift, and weekly production on the Hot Strip Mill and weekly production on the Zodiac galvanising line. During the year, Morfa coke ovens made it's 1.5 millionth push since commissioning in 1981.\n\n## New Products\n\nDuring the year, TSE introduced 16 new products into the Group's product portfolio. Major new products are:\n\n- \u00b7 VALAST  450:  abrasion  resistant  steel  grade  for  the engineering sector;\n- \u00b7 XPF 800 for tubes: cost-e/ffective high-strength alternative to Boron steel;\n- \u00b7 MagiZinc 310: products with superior corrosion protection, even at cut edges.\n\nDi/fferentiated products accounted for 38% of TSE's portfolio.\n\n## Strategic Activities\n\nTSE  started  the  FY  2020-21  against  the  backdrop  of  the COVID-19 pandemic which caused a signi/ficant drop in demand for the Group's steel products and created challenges for TSE's production facilities and for the health and safety of employees. In the /first quarter of FY 2020-21, demand for the Group's steel products was down by about 20% due to COVID-19 with certain sectors such as automotive experiencing a sharper decline than others, such as packaging, where demand was largely una/ffected.  TSE  also  received  government  support  where available including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in the UK, the Noodmaatregel Overbrugging voor Werkbehoud ('NOW  scheme')  in  the  Netherlands,  and  in  the  form  of agreed deferrals to payroll taxes and VAT in both the UK and Netherlands. TSE ensured a co-ordinated and agile approach in order to protect the health and well-being of its employees with those who could work from home doing so, supported by the appropriate tools, systems, policies and guidelines in line with the national requirements. The manufacturing processes continued to operate with new social distancing practices and solutions deployed, underpinned by management of change and daily communication from leaders at all levels across TSE.\n\nThroughout the year TSE continued to build on its successful company-wide Transformation programme to improve the performance  of  the  business,  helping  it  to  become  more sustainable and enabling investments necessary to secure its long-term future. Improvements in performance came from productivity improvements, increased sales of higher-value steels, and employment cost savings. In the FY 2020-21, the Transformation programme delivered over \u00a3200m worth of sustainable bene/fits in addition to the over \u00a3200 million worth of bene/fits delivered in FY 2019-20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The pro/fit before tax was higher than that of the previous year due to lower expenses, /financial support from Government and decrease in /finance cost.\n\n## v) Tata Steel Thailand ('TSTH')\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit / (loss) of TSTH for the FY 2020-21 are as follows:\n\n|                                                    | FY 21   | ( '  crore) FY 20   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| Turnover                                           | 5,264   | 4,617               |\n| EBITDA                                             | 325     | 177                 |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before exceptional items | 193     | 40                  |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                           | 165     | 25                  |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before exceptional items  | 179     | 26                  |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                            | 151     | 10                  |\n\nThe production and sales performance of TSTH is given below:\n\n|                |   FY 21 |   FY 20 |   (mn tonnes) Change (%) |\n|----------------|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Saleable Steel |    1.33 |    1.21 |                       10 |\n| Sales          |    1.3  |    1.2  |                        9 |\n\nDuring FY 2020-21 after initial business interruptions all the plants operated at full capacity. The production and deliveries in FY 2020-21 were higher than that of the previous year due to increased steel demand as there was a shortfall in the supplies as  major  steel  producing  countries  were  under  periodic/ frequent  lockdowns  to  prevent  the  spread  of  COVID-19. The turnover was higher by 14% mainly on account of higher volumes along with increase in prices. The pro/fit before tax was higher mainly due to higher revenues along with lower conversion cost and lower cost of raw materials.\n\nThe company is in the midst of various digital initiatives like HR Easy Connect, E-RFX, Tata App, Remote monitoring of operations etc. The company has launched new products - DB Stirrup and ready-made precast footings.\n\n## Recognition:\n\n- \u00b7 TSTH received 'Thailand Sustainability Investment (THSI) Award 2020' from the Stock Exchange of Thailand.\n- \u00b7 NTS  won  'Thailand  Labour  Management  Excellence Award 2020' in National Level from Department of Labour Protection & Welfare, Ministry of Labour.\n\n## vi) Tata Metaliks Limited\n\nTata Metaliks Limited ( ' T ML' ) has its manufacturing plant at Kharagpur, West Bengal, India which produces 300kt of pig iron and 200kt of ductile iron pipes annually.

With gradual relaxation of lockdown from June 2020, business resumed, foundries  started  ramping  up  their  production  but  were constrained due to acute shortage of labour. Pig Iron market witnessed a strong bounce back in terms of demand, which sustained throughout the year. Pig Iron markets have seen an unprecedented surge with net realisations crossing those of DI.\n\nIn  Digital  Transformation  journey,  TML  has  in  FY  2020-21 implemented some key real-time data and analytics focused projects such as Manufacturing Execution System for DIP, Energy Management System and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Solution. TML has strengthened its capability in area of robotics and developed in-house robotics solutions which are being implemented for the /first time in DIP industry in the country. TML currently has three robots operational in its DIP production lines with several others likely to be deployed in coming /financial year.\n\nIn FY  2020-21,  TML  has  successfully  commissioned 15  MW  captive  power  plant  which  will  enhance  energy e/fficiency and utilisation of waste heat and /flue gas generated from its coke ovens and blast furnaces. It also completed the expansion of Coke Plant.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit / (loss) /figures of TML for the FY 2020-21 are as follows:\n\n|                          | ( '  crore)   | ( '  crore)   |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                          | FY 21         | FY 20         |\n| Turnover                 | 1,917         | 2,051         |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) | 306           | 201           |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  | 220           | 166           |\n\nDuring the FY 2020-21, due to the COVID-19 lockdown and disruptions during Q1FY2021, the production of Pig Iron ( 'PI' ) was about 283kt lower by 37kt than that of the previous year and production of ductile iron pipes ( 'DI' ) was at 187kt, lower by 38kt than that of the previous year. Deliveries of PI were at 287kt, lower by 27kt than that of the previous year and deliveries of ductile iron pipes were at 194 kt lower by 24kt than that of the previous year in line with lower production and demand.\n\nThe turnover declined by 7% due to decrease in volumes along with lower realisation of DI partly o/ffset by increase in prices of PI due to strong demand and increase in iron ore prices. Pro/fit before tax increased by \u20b9105 crore (52% higher) despite decline in revenues, mainly driven by better operational performance and e/fficiencies and lower raw material prices.\n\nDuring  COVID-19  situation,  TML  had  provided  interim relief  in  the  form  of  Dry  Ration  Kits  to  the  affected community in the region where it operates and donated \u20b91 crore towards State Government's COVID relief fund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## vii) The Tinplate Company of India Limited\n\nThe Tinplate Company of India Limited ( ' TCIL' ) is the largest indigenous producer of tin-coated and tin free steel used for metal packaging.

TCIL has two Cold Rolling Mills and two electrolytic tinning lines with an installed annual production capacity of around 379kt of tinplate and tinfree steel.\n\nThe  year  under  review  experienced  unprecedented uncertainties due to the pandemic, leading to an impact on the operating performance of TCIL. The major impact of the pandemic was felt in Q1FY2021 especially in the month of April 2020, due to the imposition of a complete lockdown.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit / (loss) /figures of TCIL for the FY 2020-21 are as follows:\n\n|                          | FY 21   | ( '  crore) FY 20   |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| Turnover                 | 2,297   | 2,123               |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) | 132     | 104                 |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  | 98      | 95                  |\n\nDuring the FY 2020-21, the production was 291kt, lower by 49 kt than that of the previous year, with an overall lower capacity utilisation primarily on account of nation-wide lockdown during Q1FY2021. However, deliveries were higher by 5kt at 316kt, attributable to higher demand primarily in the domestic market. The turnover increased by 8% mainly due to increase in market realisation along with marginally higher volumes. Pro/fit before tax increased by 27% than that of the previous year due to higher operating pro/fits and lower /finance cost.\n\n## Key Business Highlights:\n\n- \u00b7 Developed new packaging con/figuration.\n- \u00b7 The company continued to work on quality improvement projects  leading  to  improvement  in  surface  quality, improvement  in  prime  yield  and  a  reduction  in  quality complaints.\n- \u00b7 Accelerated the adoption of various IT enabled applications in the areas of production planning, digitisation, communication, and review process across the organisation.\n- \u00b7 The  cost  management  initiative  has  been  driven  by two  methodologies  -  TPM  and  Disha  initiative,  led  to costs  savings  in  several  areas  including  power  and  roll consumption.\n- \u00b7 TCIL successfully implemented its pilot solar power project - Phase 1 (200 kwp).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The performance post Q1FY2021, o/ffset the entire loss incurred in Q1FY2020-21 due to the lockdown.\n\nDuring the year under review, EBITDA improvement initiative 'Lakshya 25' resulted in operational e/fficiency, cost management and pro/fitability resulting in cost savings of about \u20b94 crore. The Management believes that these initiatives will in the long run unleash added value to the Company's stakeholders.\n\nThe  turnover  and  pro/fit  /  (loss)  /figures  of  TSDPL  for  the FY 2020-21 are as follows:\n\n|                          | ( ' FY 21   | crore) FY 20   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Turnover                 | 3,620       | 3,108          |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) | 97          | 95             |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  | 81          | 61             |\n\nDuring the year under review, the production from tolling business was at 1,825kt marginally lower by 11kt than that of previous year and distribution business was at 636kt, higher by 9kt than that of the previous year due to increase in demand from second half of the /financial year in the auto segment. The deliveries from tolling business were 1,651kt which was lower than that of the previous year by 8% due to the impact of  COVID-19.  The  deliveries  in  distribution  business  were 661kt, higher by 52kt (9%) than that of the previous year due to improvement in demand from auto segment. The turnover for the /financial year increased by 16% due to improvement in market conditions, attributable to increase in steel prices and higher volumes from distribution business, partly o/ffset by lower tolling volumes. The pro/fit before tax was almost at par with the previous year mainly due to lower margin from conversion business o/ffset by lower /finance cost.\n\nDuring COVID-19 lockdowns and business interruptions, the volumes fell by ~70% in Q1FY2021 resulting in loss of contribution of \u20b954 crore, total unabsorbed cost of \u20b921 crore and additional spend for combating COVID-19 and safety of employees.\n\n## ix) Bhubaneshwar Power Private Limited ('BPPL')\n\nUninterrupted power supply and cost of power is a challenge for large power intensive process industries. Industries which produce 365 days per annum continue to depend on thermal power plants for their base load requirements.\n\nBPPL is in the business of generation of power. It owns 135 MW (2x67.5 MW) coal based power plant in Odisha. BPPL supplies 120.5 MW power to Tata Steel Limited and Tata Steel Mining Limited (formerly T S Alloys Limited).\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit / (loss) /figures of BPPL for the FY 202021 are as follows:\n\n|                          |   FY 21 | ( '  crore) FY 20   |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| Turnover                 |     489 | 510                 |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) |      28 | (9)                 |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  |      20 | 25                  |\n\nDuring the year under review, power generation increased to  971  million  units  as  against  931  million  units  in FY 2019-20. The sale of power increased to 860 million units in FY 2020-21 as against 822 million units in FY 2019-20. The plant operated at a better load factor of 82.14% as against 78.21% in FY 2019-20. Station heat rate has decreased to 2,793 kcal/Kwh from 2,889 kcal/kwh and auxilliary power consumption in FY 2020-21 was lower at 11.40% as compared to 11.72% in FY 2019-20.\n\nDuring  the  year  under  review,  the  turnover  of  BPPL  was ~4% lower than that of the previous year, due to lower cost of generation due to the 'cost plus contract' revenue model. Pro/fit before tax increased mainly due to lower depreciation and amortisation charges on intangible assets being fully depreciated during the year along with lower /finance cost due to repayments and lower rates. However, pro/fit after tax decreased due to an accounting credit on re-assessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities post adoption of lower tax rate which were announced in the previous year.\n\n## x) Creative Port Development Private Limited\n\nCreative Port Development Private Limited ( 'CPDPL' ) is in possession of a 54 year concession from the Government of Odisha for development of a Green/field Seaport at Chaumukh Village,  in  Balasore  District,  Odisha  on  a  'BOOST'  basis (Build, Own, Operate, Share & Transfer).

The company had participated in the auction process of the chrome mines whose leases had expired on March 31, 2020 and have bagged three leases of chromite mines viz Sukinda, Saruabil and Kamarda mines situated in the Jajpur district of Odisha. The lease period for these leases is /fifty years.\n\nTSML has a ferro-chrome plant in Athagarh and Gopalpur in Odisha. TSML has been working with conversion partners in India, supply chain and the marketing & sales function to deliver value to its domestic and overseas customers. SAP Hana was also implemented during the year. TSML has started the operational excellence programme 'Shikhar' to build a competitive cost structure across value chain.\n\nAmidst  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Sukinda  Mines  started operations  from  September  2020  through  an  asset  light business  model.  A  mine  development  operator  has  been deployed  under  long-term  contract  to  carry  out  mining operations  in  all  the  three  mines  viz.  Sukinda,  Saruabil and  Kamarda.  In  FY  2020-21,  all  three  mines  together produced ~1 MnT of chromite ore. Since December 2020, the Company has started producing from its plant at Athagarh and is selling High Carbon Ferro Chrome. The company sold around 28kt High Carbon Ferro Chrome in national and international markets in FY 2020-21.\n\nDue to COVID-19, the plant production was a/ffected for a fortnight with six months delay in start-up of the mining operations as there were challenges in resource mobilisation, vendor  onboarding,  regulatory  formalities  /  approval  etc. which led to a /financial impact of ~ ' 8 crore.\n\n## V. Financial Performance\n\n## 1. Tata Steel Limited (Standalone)\n\nDuring the FY 2020-21, the Company recorded a pro/fit after tax of \u20b913,607 crore (previous year \u20b96,744 crore). The increase is primarily on account of improvement in realisations, lower cost of production, and higher exceptional gain against charge as compared to that of the previous year. The basic and diluted earnings for the FY 2020-21 were at \u20b9117.04 per share and \u20b9117.03 per share respectively (previous year: basic and diluted: \u20b957.11 per share).\n\nLeadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe analysis of major items of the /financial statements is given below:\n\n## a) Revenue from operations\n\n|                                | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                | FY 21       | FY 20       | Change (%)  |\n| Sale of products               | 62,277      | 57,168      | 9           |\n| Sale of power and water        | 1,467       | 1,648       | (11)        |\n| Other operating revenue        | 1,125       | 1,620       | (31)        |\n| Total revenue from  operations | 64,869      | 60,436      | 7           |\n\nDuring the year under review, sale of products was higher as compared to the previous year, primarily due to increase in realisations in domestic as well as export markets and higher sale of iron ore to Group Companies along with increase in prices. Ferro Alloys and Mineral Division ( 'FAMD' ) registered lower  revenue  owing  to  lower  volumes  of  Ferro  Chrome along with decline in prices of manganese alloys, partly o/ffset by higher prices of Ferro Chrome. Sale of power and water declined due to lower demand owing to lockdown. Other operating revenue decreased mainly due to lower bene/fits arising out of exports.\n\n## b) Purchases of stock-in-trade\n\n|                             | FY 21   | FY 20   | Change (%)   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|--------------|\n| Purchases of stock-in-trade | 1,146   | 1,563   | (27)         |\n\nDuring the year under review, Purchases of stock-in-trade was lower as compared to previous /financial year due to lower purchases of imported rebars, wire rods and billets, hot rolled coils and structural steel owing to lower requirement, partly o/ffset  by  increase  in  purchases  at  sustainable  businesses including New Materials Business, Services & Solutions and Steel Recycling Business.\n\n## c) Cost of materials consumed\n\n|                            | FY 21   | FY 20   | (\u20b9 crore) Change (%)   |\n|----------------------------|---------|---------|------------------------|\n| Cost of materials consumed | 13,869  | 17,407  | (20)                   |\n\nDuring the year under review, cost of materials consumed decreased primarily due to lower prices of imported coal, along with lower consumption of coal and purchased pellet, ferro alloys and other raw materials due to lower production owing to lockdown during Q1FY2021.\n\n## d) Employee bene/fits expense\n\n|                            | FY 21   | FY 20   |   Change (%) |\n|----------------------------|---------|---------|--------------|\n| Employee bene/fits expense | 5,199   | 5,037   |            3 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net debt further decreased due to higher current investments and cash and bank balances.\n\n4) EBITDA Margin: Increased primarily on account of increase in operating pro/fits due to higher prices and decline in raw material costs.\n\n- 5) Net Pro/fit Margin and Return on average net worth: Increased primarily on account of increase in net pro/fits mainly attributable to higher operating pro/fits and higher exceptional gains as compared to charge in the previous year.\n\n## 2. Tata Steel Limited (Consolidated)\n\nThe consolidated pro/fit after tax of the Company was \u20b98,190 crore as against \u20b91,172 crore in the previous year.

At Tata Steel (Standalone) the expense was lower due to lower purchases of imported rebars, wire rods and billets and structural steel owing to lower requirement, partly o/ffset by increase at other sustainable businesses. This was o/ffset by increase in expense at South East Asia mainly at TSTH due to increase in production, while at NatSteel Holding, expense was lower on account of lower production. Others primarily include transactions at TCIL and TSDPL which are majorly eliminated on consolidation and increase at Tata Steel Minerals Canada Limited post commencement of operations during the year.\n\n## c) Cost of materials consumed\n\n|                                   | FY 21    | FY 20    | (\u20b9 crore) Change (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|------------------------|\n| Tata Steel (Standalone)           | 13,869   | 17,407   | (20)                   |\n| TSBSL                             | 10,024   | 10,816   | (7)                    |\n| TSE                               | 22,121   | 22,784   | (3)                    |\n| TSLP                              | 2,182    | 2,392    | (9)                    |\n| South East Asia                   | 341      | 349      | (2)                    |\n| Others                            | 29,273   | 31,981   | (8)                    |\n| Eliminations & Adjustments        | (31,622) | (32,136) | 2                      |\n| Total cost of materials  consumed | 46,188   | 53,593   | (14)                   |\n\nConsumption was lower across all major entities mainly due to lower cost of consumption of imported coal owing to lower prices and lower production attributable to lock-down and lower consumption and prices of other raw materials, partly o/ffset by increase in iron ore prices mainly at TSBSL and TSLP. Tata Steel Europe reported decrease in GBP terms due to decline in production along with lower coal and coke prices o/ffset by higher iron ore prices and adverse exchange impact on translation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nF",

Net debt further decreased due\n\nto higher current investments o/ffset by lower cash and bank balances.\n\n4) EBITDA Margin: Increased primarily on account of increase in operating pro/fits across geographies due to higher prices and decline in raw material costs.\n\n- 5) Net Pro/fit Margin and Return on average net worth: Increased primarily on account of increase in net pro/fits mainly attributable to higher operating pro/fits and lower exceptional charges as compared to that of the previous year.\n\n## VI. Strategy\n\nFew  existing  companies  were  there  when  the  last  global pandemic hit in 1918. Tata Steel Limited is one of them. A century later, the Company dealt with COVID-19 with equal determination  and  trust,  keeping  our  employees  and  the community at the core of our response. Medical infrastructure in  Jharkhand  and  Orissa  was  ramped  up,  creating  more isolation beds and providing Personal Protective Equipment. Tata Bridgital platform was deployed for proactive testing of high-risk frontline employees. Stranded migrant workers were provided help across many states. The Company collaborated with peers and public systems to identity and provide job opportunities for people impacted by the pandemic. Within the workforce, the Company pioneered the use of job clusters or PODs to ensure business continuity. Ensuring health and safety of the workforce and workplace was key to our resilience.\n\nDuring the year under review, production reduced due to lockdowns, but the year ended with production at full capacity and the highest quarterly earnings till date leading to signi/ficant deleveraging.  The  pandemic  showed  the  importance  of investing in future-ready capabilities. Investments in digital infrastructure  and  cloud  network  over  the  last  few  years enabled a seamless transition of a large part of the employee base to work from home. Suraksha App enabled real-time tracking of people to ensure COVID-19 protocol compliance. Connected assets, operations and demand platforms ensured asset reliability, uninterrupted operations with skeletal on-site workforce and demand generation using digital platforms. An agile response allowed the supply chain to handle disruptions, manage the surge in export volumes and exploit opportunities to improve pro/fitability.\n\nTata Steel's strategy is focused on becoming future ready structurally, /financially and culturally. Over the last decade, the Company has consolidated and rebalanced its portfolio in favour of higher capacity in India. We are in the process of simplifying the organisation at the Tata Steel Group level, while In India the portfolio is being simpli/fied into four clusters. Adjacent businesses (New Materials, Services & Solutions) were established. Foundations of a technology enabled sustainable business model, digital and technology leadership were also laid. During the year under review, the Company has taken",

The Company remains committed to become the most valuable and respected steel Company globally, by 2030. In pursuit of its goal, the Company has refreshed its longterm strategies to extend its strategic horizon to 2030. The priority for the next /five years is to improve the structural and /financial strength of the Company. This will be the foundation for signi/ficant growth thereafter.\n\nThe  Company  aspires  to  achieve  its  long-term  goals  by pursuing the following strategic objectives:\n\nLeadership in India: Company's focus on India aligns with the increasing prominence of India in the global steel industry. The Company aims to lead in the Indian market by being the most respected and preferred steel supplier to discerning customers. This ambition establishes the need to be ahead of the curve on digital disruptions, changing consumer behaviour, and building a culture of customer obsession throughout the organisation. Key attributes of leadership include delivering innovative products & services, serving existing and emerging customer needs and providing the best customer experience.\n\nConsolidate position as global cost leader: As the steel industry faces extreme business cycles which signi/ficantly impact  pricing  and  hence  pro/fitability,  it  is  important  for Tata Steel to prepare for and generate pro/fits even in times of prolonged low steel prices. Operational e/fficiency is key to Tata Steel's cost leadership position. Several initiatives like Aspire, Shikhar 25 have led several KPIs to be at global / Indian benchmark levels. Cost leadership is also the outcome of innovation and execution of structural cost reduction initiatives such as investment in strengthening logistics networks, /fixed cost reduction, etc.\n\nAttain  leadership  position  in  adjacent  businesses: To achieve Tata Steel's vision of the future, it is important to explore and lead in adjacent businesses that leverage our capability and market opportunity. The approach is to have a capex-lite business models and di/fferentiating through deep understating of customer needs, technology and knowledge. Adjacent businesses where the Company aspires to attain leadership position are:\n\n- 1) Services & Solutions ( 'S&S' ) - Leveraging the Company's deep knowledge and expertise in steel applications to create solutions for construction and household applications such as doors, windows and housing solutions.\n- 2) New Materials Business ( 'NMB' ) - Taking advantage of growth in non-steel materials driven by megatrends (such as  light-weighting,  cleaner  environment),  NMB  will  create technology-driven businesses in identi/fied materials.\n- 3) Commercial Mining (through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tata Steel Mining Ltd.) - The Company aspires to leverage, the\n\nLeadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nopportunities arriving from the Government's 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' Programme, regulatory changes and the need to meet captive raw material requirements beyond 2030 by creating a sustainable mining business.\n\nLeadership in sustainability: Sustainability is a key issue for the steel industry. The Company aspires to take leadership role in sustainability in the steel industry and use technology to address the challenge of climate change. The goal is to signi/ficantly reduce the carbon intensity of our operations going forward and also reduce fresh water usage. Creating a positive impact on biodiversity in India and working with our partners to create a sustainable supply chain are also key priorities. Tata Steel is taking up key technology projects in the areas of clean hydrogen and carbon capture & usage to facilitate achievement of the carbon emission goals.\n\nTo achieve its strategic objectives, the Company has identi/fied four strategic enablers. Tata Steel aspires to be the Best Place to Work for in Manufacturing in India with a workforce that is future ready, engaged, and high performing. The steel industry is becoming smarter and more agile, evolving towards Industry 4.0. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend signi/ficantly. Tata Steel which has already embarked on a digital journey and has 3 World Economic Forum Industry 4.0 lighthouse sites, aspires to be a digital leader in the steel industry globally. The company recognises that technology led di/fferentiation in products and processes is going to be key to attain and sustain a leadership position in the industry. To this e/ffect, it aspires to be among the top 5 in steel technology globally. This will enable the Company to meet the emerging needs of existing and new segments and meet challenges like sustainability. Fostering a culture which makes Tata Steel future ready across agility, innovation, digital, environment, diversity, and safety will be critical for the Company to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n## VII.  Human Resources Management and Industrial Relations\n\nHuman resource has always been one of the most valued stakeholders  and  a  key  di/fferentiator  for  Tata  Steel.  The Company's  goal  of  becoming  the  'Best  Workplace  in Manufacturing' has led us on a path of new world of possibilities, requiring us to re-de/fine our agenda through our collaborated actions to make it more employee centric.\n\nTo enable the organisation to attain its full potential, it is imperative for us to create and maintain an ideal work culture thus creating an engaged and skilled workforce capable of delivering on the commitments to our stakeholders and in the process, making us 'Future Ready'- structurally, /financially and culturally. Tata Steel has a culture of working together through joint consultation between Union and Management and has a very strong commitment towards community development. Our  people  practices  have  enabled  us  in  creating  an\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "environment of collaboration and connect which has aided us to achieve industrial harmony of over 92 years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our journey of being Digital  leader  in  Steel  industry  globally.  For  us,  COVID-19 brought digitalisation into sharp focus with many projects being  implemented  to  ensure  employee  safety  through data driven decision-making. One such project 'Connected Workforce system' was implemented with focus on improving safety  of  contract  workforce  engaged  in  our  plants.  POD working system, remote working for employees to the extent possible and Suraksha app were introduced in the Company to ensure employee safety and well-being. People Care - a 24*7 helpline was also introduced to provide accurate and quick information on COVID-19 and address grievances / queries of employees. The Company was also recognised by UN GCNI for its e/fforts on 'Being Focused on People during and post COVID-19'.\n\nTo remain competitive, improving employee productivity is of utmost importance to the organisation and we strive to achieve benchmark  performance  in  this  area  through  continuous e/fforts with initiatives like customised 'Sunehre Bhavishya Ki Yojana' for redundancy management and Team Performance Reward which was introduced during the year. The overall Employees on Roll ( 'EOR' ) for the Company reduced from 32,364 to 31,189 in FY 2020-21.\n\nDuring the year under review we implemented some major initiatives to promote inclusion and diversity. We deployed the /first batch of 22 women as heavy machinery operators at Noamundi iron mine and extended 'Women@Mines' coverage in Raw Materials Division. We have rolled out various initiatives for LGBTQ+ community like developing a site for the LGBTQ+ community and the allies to connect, interact and share their experiences and make a di/fference. E/fforts have also been taken on creating digital infrastructure for diverse workforce as well as retaining and developing women leaders to create a pool of diverse talent in the organisation. Our continuous e/fforts in this direction have led to the increase in gender diversity from 6.5% to 7.4% and reduction in attrition of female employees from 8% to 6%.\n\nWe ensured that we stay ahead of the curve, with our focused employee experience initiatives such as Agile working policy, to enable employees to work remotely, Rewards Hub, a one stop solution for all o/fficers related policies and bene/fits, etc. To  measure  our  performance,  eNPS  (Net  Promoter  Score) for  HR  processes  was  launched  companywide.  We  also launched Alumni Portal to engage with superannuated and separated o/fficers. Real-time dashboards using analytics were implemented to provide insights on employee cost, diversity & workforce productivity. Also, various cost optimisation and deferment initiatives were undertaken in FY 2020-21.\n\nMultiple interventions for skill building of our own and contract employees were undertaken during the year. Action learning projects through School of Excellence, were rolled out in prioritised areas of Steel Plant Operations and Maintenance with  the  objective  of  developing  world-class  technical competencies and maximise business performance. Tata Steel Digi-e-shala, an intrapreneurial venture by o/ffering learning and development services to external world was launched. The initiative won the World Steelie Award'2020 constituted by World Steel Association for Excellence in Education and Training.\n\nTata Steel was once again certi/fied as Great Place to Work in the Great Place to Work study and was declared as one of the top 30 'India's Best Workplaces in the Manufacturing sector' by Great Place to Work for the 4th time. Tata Steel was also recognised as India Workplace Equality Index ( 'IWEI' ) Top Employers 2020 for the commitment demonstrated towards advancing equality for LGBTQ+ people.\n\n## VIII. Digital Transformation\n\nTata Steel as an organisation has always been an early adopter of the latest technologies. Over the last few years, the Company has been driving Business Transformation through adoption of Digital Technologies. The Company aspires to be the Global Digital Leader in Steel Manufacturing by 2030 through digital interventions across its value chain, remodel work practices by enhancing digital maturity and in the process, be more insightful, intelligent and agile as an organisation.\n\nTata Steel banked upon Cloud, Data and Arti/ficial Intelligence ( 'AI' ) as the building blocks of its digital transformation journey and made substantial investments to augment its network, computing, and cyber security capabilities. The Company moved ~85% of its servers to cloud over the last 3 years in one of the biggest cloud migration programmes in Asia. The Company's cyber security cell was equipped with the necessary expertise & tools to pre-empt cyber threats & intrusions. The investments made on building up the sturdy infrastructure proved to be a lifesaver over the last year, when all were forced to operate remotely due to the pandemic. Without any special e/fforts, the Company has been able to seamlessly connect to the Company's network while working from home and continued production even with a skeletal workforce physically present at the mines and plants. The employees logging into enterprise applications and virtual meetings taking place each day, the Company has been running business as usual with no adverse impact on employee productivity.\n\nAlong with Digital Transformation, the division has parallelly focused on transforming the Company from being process driven to data driven. The idea is to use data to generate better business insights and drive decision-making coupled with",

The 4th Industrial Revolution Advanced Global Lighthouse recognition by World Economic Forum conferred on Tata Steel Jamshedpur only strengthens our belief on the transformational journey we are undertaking. On the Digital Maturity front, Gartner's Digital Execution Scorecard Report compared the Company's Digital Execution journey with globally comparable industry sectors over a 12 months horizon and rated our digital maturity to be better than the market average.\n\nIn Tata Steel, well de/fined & lean processes have always been one of the strongest pillars driving operational excellence. Over the last year, we have focused towards building multiple business platforms to consolidate bespoke IT solutions, analyse the data generated to aid intelligent decision-making and enable process e/fficiencies, thereby ensuring global optima.\n\nThe company uses Connected Workforce platform designed to cover employees and contract workers in the areas of safety, security and productivity. The platform gives us end-to-end visibility of the work patterns of the contract workforce across plants and helps pre-empt unsafe incidents while improving the workforce productivity through analytics.\n\nOur  e-commerce  platforms  such  as  Aashiyana,  DigECA, Compass etc. have already proved their mettle and drove sales and customer connect over the last year. Aashiyana clocked record business during COVID-19 delivering a 7 times growth over FY 2018-19. Through digital interventions we have been able to achieve a reduction of 30% in customer complain resolution time.\n\nThe Company has developed multiple asset-speci/fic algorithms to predict failures as well as residual life of equipment. This has minimised failure scenarios for mission critical equipment and eliminated unplanned downtime. The Smart Asset Maintenance Platform is helping to achieve higher asset availability at lower maintenance cost, across equipment from mines to rolling mills through enhanced sensorisation & building predictive analytics solutions.\n\nThe  Company  has  revamped  its  procurement  process  by introducing digital catalogue-based buying, commodity price prediction aided buying, analytics powered negotiation tools for the Category Managers, and end-to-end contract lifecycle management & analytics. The Procurement 4.0 platform has enabled ~50% reduction in vendor registration cycle time and ~20% reduction in Purchase requisition to purchase order cycle time.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic came as a challenge for one and all. At Tata Steel, we undertook multiple Digital Safety Initiatives with utmost urgency to cope up with the threats of the virus. Through the Suraksha Platform, we ensured health and safety of our employees, from them entering company's premises through their work hours. Camera feeds were used to identify people without face coverings through an AI based Face Mask\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetection solution and pre-empt & detect violation of Social distancing at shop /floors, canteens & on roads. The Crowd Sensing solution sent out alerts if any section of the workplace had a large group of people. The same was also getting tracked through  a  real-time  digital  heatmap.  Suraksha  Scanners empowered Security personnel at entry gates scan RFID cards through smart phones and extract relevant information on Travel Declaration and Suraksha Compliance of our Contract workmen thereby preventing high risk people from entering our  premises.  All  these  initiatives  were  bundled  up  and accessed  through  one  single  dashboard  thereby  helping in immediate response. The Tata Steel's digital response to COVID-19 was ranked amongst the top 6% globally by one of the surveys conducted by Gartner.\n\n## IX. E/ffect of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted the economy and businesses  not  only  in  India,  but  all  over  the  World.  The rapid spread of the infection amongst the Indian population, forced Government of India to announce the imposition of nation-wide lockdown from March 25, 2020. This brought all logistics, businesses establishments and industries to a grinding halt except where the government had noti/fied that essential services and process industries where the continuous operations  of  the  plant  facilities  are  important  (including Integrated  steel  plants),  are  exempt  from  the  lockdown measures and can continue to operate subject to the hygiene standards and social distancing norms being followed.\n\nHowever, the crisis of the pandemic continued throughout the year under review. In current phase the crisis has become severe with the onset of second wave of the pandemic.\n\n## a) Impact on the operations\n\nThe Company adopted safety and hygiene standards at shop /floor and o/ffices and implemented social distancing norms, work  from  home,  workforce  deployment  plan,  staggered shift timing for safety of the employees. The Company has instantly moved all essential activities to digital platform. The blast furnace and steel making operations at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar operated at production levels lower than normal due to suspension of the downstream facilities as despatches of /finished goods could not be done to customer operations in automotive, construction and other segments as they were closed due to lockdown. Even the Strategic Business Units ( 'SBUs' ) of Steel like Bearings, Tubes, Wires were also closed. The supply chain activities were a/ffected as all despatches were stopped.\n\n## b)  Impact  on  the  pro/fitability,  cash  /flow,  liquidity  and /financials\n\nThe closure of business led to decline in steel deliveries which resulted in lower earnings and piling up of the /finished goods inventory. Post lockdown, the plant production was gradually\n\n<!-- image -->",

In view of ramping up of the production, there is no threat of redundancies of the existing assets. The Company's robust digital initiatives have enabled compliance of the internal /financial controls and reporting of the Company. The Company has been ful/filling its legal obligations as required for execution of the existing contracts / agreements, so there is no e/ffect of the lockdown on the business.\n\nThe Company has continued to have a strong liquidity position. In response to the COVID-19, the Company has sharpened its focus on cash. A cash war room exercise has been undertaken with an aim of running cash neutral operations. Out/flows are  monitored  to  have  it  minimised  by  cutting  down  on non-essential  expenditure,  renegotiating  payment  terms with vendors, improving working capital management and reducing capex. However, given the uncertainty, the Company has also sought to create a liquidity bu/ffer. The Company raised funds in April and May 2020 through issue of Non-Convertible Debentures. The Company has secured short-term borrowings to handle any situation of shortage of liquidity.\n\nThe Company has always strived to have a balanced maturity pro/file and a judicious mix of funding instruments which help in minimising costs while providing /flexibility in managing cash/flows. Taking its cash/flows and liquidity position into account, the Company is con/fident that it will be able to service its debt and other /financing arrangements. The company has chosen not to avail the moratorium o/ffered by RBI on interest and principal payments, demonstrating its ability to service its debt obligations.\n\n## c) Corporate Social Responsibility -helping the community in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe  Company  through  Tata  Steel  Foundation  ( 'TSF' )  and District Administration have reached out to the citizens of the Company's operational areas Jharkhand and Odisha through various initiatives such as food, sustainable livelihood to the communities & migrant labourers of the region, provided ration and safety support to the vulnerable communities, augmented the medical facilities at the designated hospitals for medical treatment and so on. In the recent crisis of supply of oxygen to various hospitals, the Company is supplying oxygen from its own oxygen plant at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar. The  Company  had  incurred  expenses  towards  hospital infrastructure, sanitisation activities in town and contribution towards COVID-19 relief.\n\n## X. Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe Company's Enterprise Risk Management ( 'ERM' ) process is based on international standards like Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission ( 'COSO' ) and ISO\n\n31000. The Company follows coordinated risk assurance and the ERM process is integrated with Corporate Audit, Strategy & Business Planning, Corporate Legal & Compliance functions. This brings further rigour in driving the process across the organisation and Tata Steel Group ( 'TSG' ) companies. An inhouse built IT system is in place across the organisation to enable recording and review of risks through live dashboards and real-time monitoring of data.\n\nRisk Management Committee ( 'RMC' ) of the Board provides oversight  and  sets  the  tone  for  implementing  the  ERM framework across the organisation. It reviews the status of key risks, progress of ERM implementation across locations and any speci/fic exceptions as /flagged to it, on quarterly basis.\n\nThe risk appetite of the organisation is aligned to the TSL Vision. Risk Appetite is driven by the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate are our prime concern and our operating strategy is focused on the above objective\n- \u00b7 All  business  decisions  are  aligned  to  the  Tata  Code  of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Management actions are focused on continuous improvement\n- \u00b7 Environment and Climate Change impacts are assessed on a continuous basis and business decisions support systems including  capital  allocation  consider  impact  of  climate impact through the internal carbon pricing framework\n- \u00b7 The  long-term  strategy  of  the  Company  is  focused  on generating  pro/fitable  growth  and  sustainable  cash/flows that creates long-term stakeholder value\n\nRisk Owners may accept risk exposure to their Annual and Long-term  business  plans,  which  after  implementation  of mitigation strategies, is aligned to our risk appetite.\n\nFor better focus on Risk Governance and ERM implementation, the Company has set up a Management Committee called Group Risk Review Committee ( 'GRRC' ). GRRC has the primary responsibility of implementing the Risk Management Policy of TSL and developing a risk intelligent culture.\n\nA  dedicated  business  vertical  has  been  set  up  to  ensure deployment  of  the  ERM  process  across  the  organisation. The team is led by Group Head - Corporate Finance & Risk Management who acts as the Chief Risk O/fficer ( 'CRO' ) of the Company. The ERM team continuously scans the external environment for developments which may throw up risks for the organisation and risk /flags are sent out to the Business Units ( 'BU' ). BUs engage in identi/fication and management of bottom-up risks, which are periodically reviewed as per de/fined ERM process. The risks are escalated and aggregated",

This is complemented by a top-down process, which helps in identi/fication of strategic, enterprise level risks.\n\nTo  assess  the  maturity  of  our  ERM  process,  Risk  Maturity Assessment was undertaken through an external partner in FY 2020-21. We are pleased to report that with a score of 4.63 on a scale of 5, TSL has been recognised to be much ahead in the maturity curve compared to its peers in mining & metal sector and marginally behind the organisations with leading score (across sectors).\n\nTSL has also been adjudged 'Masters of Risk in Metals & Mining' and 'Risk Technology' categories, at the 7th edition of The India Risk Management Awards.\n\nRisk  intelligent  culture  of  TSL  enabled  it  to  manage  the uncertainties in an unprecedented business environment in FY 2020-21. As the Covid situation evolved, 'scenario-based risk assessment' was facilitated across the Company.\n\nBusiness decisions were pivoted to achieve cash neutrality in operations by reducing spend, managing working capital and reducing capital expenditures. Operating regime was recalibrated in response to the decline in domestic demand. Supply chain disruptions were managed through obtaining necessary licenses to ensure movement of raw materials and /finished goods. In view of sluggish domestic steel demand, risk to sales was mitigated through enhanced exports and new international markets were targeted.\n\nTo reduce dependence on global commodity supply chains, captive coal, iron ore and pellet inventory were ramped up to reduce the buy post normalisation of operations and improve pro/fitability. Investments made by the Company over the years on digital transformation, ensured seamless migration of our work processes to remote working models across the Company locations. The Company also engaged in assessing the risk of single geography sourcing and mitigations have been put in place to diversify sourcing and / or /find alternate materials.\n\nImplementation of focused risk mitigation strategies coupled with  improvement  in  the  global  and  domestic  macro environment has signi/ficantly improved TSL risk pro/file in H2 FY 2020-21. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Company has been able to deleverage beyond the target set for the year.\n\nThe Company continues to be vigilant of the evolving pandemic situation  to  proactively  manage  risks,  as  they  emerge  in FY  2021-22.  Health  and  safety  of  employees  and  the communities in the vicinity of our operations, continues to be the top-most priority for the Company, whilst simultaneously ensuring continuity of our business operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA detailed overview on the risk landscape and mitigation strategies  as  well  as  the  strategies  for  capitalising  on opportunities  in  business  is  provided  in  the  'Risk  and Opportunities' Section forming part of the Integrated Report.\n\n## XI. Internal Financial Control Systems and Internal Audit\n\nThe  Company  has  an  Internal  Financial  Controls  ( 'IFC' ) framework, commensurate with the size, scale, and complexity of the Company's operations. The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for ensuring that IFC have been laid down by the Company and that such controls are adequate and operating e/ffectively. The internal control framework has been designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to recording and providing reliable /financial and operational information, complying with applicable laws, safeguarding assets from unauthorised use, executing transactions with proper authorisation and ensuring compliance with corporate policies.\n\nThe  Company's  internal  financial  control  framework  is commensurate with the size and operations of the business and is in line with requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company has laid down Standard Operating Procedures and policies to guide the operations of each of its functions. Business heads are responsible to ensure compliance with these policies and procedures. Robust and continuous internal monitoring mechanisms ensure timely identi/fication of risks and issues. To make the controls more robust and comprehensive, IFC standardisation & rationalisation project was undertaken in FY 2020-21 which has ensured comprehensive coverage cutting across all functions of the Company. The management, statutory auditors and internal auditors have also carried out adequate due diligence of the control environment of the Company through rigorous testing.\n\nThe  Company  has  deployed  SAP  Governance,  Risk  and Compliance ( 'GRC' ) Module and other IT platforms to keep the IFC framework robust and our Information Management Policy governs these IT platforms. IFC have been documented and embedded in the business processes and such controls have been assessed during the year under review and no material weaknesses were observed.\n\nThe scope and authority of the Internal Audit function is de/fined in the Internal Audit Charter. To maintain its objectivity and independence, the Internal Audit function reports to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit team develops an annual audit plan based on the risk pro/file of the business activities. The Internal Audit plan is approved by the Audit Committee, which also reviews compliance to the plan. The Internal Audit team monitors and evaluates the e/fficacy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

E/ffective corporate governance practices constitute the  strong  foundation  on  which  successful  commercial enterprises are built to last. Strong leadership and e/ffective corporate governance practices have been the Company's hallmark inherited from its culture and ethos. At Tata Steel, it is imperative that our Company's a/ffairs are managed in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nWe ensure that we evolve and follow not just the stated corporate governance guidelines, but also global best practices. We consider it our inherent responsibility to protect the rights of our shareholders and disclose timely, adequate and accurate information regarding our /financials and performance, as well as the leadership and governance of the Company.\n\nIn accordance with our Vision, Tata Steel Group ( 'TSG' ) aspires to be the global steel industry benchmark for 'value creation' and 'corporate citizenship'. TSG expects to realise its Vision by taking such actions as may be necessary, to achieve its goals of value creation, safety, environment and people.\n\nThe Company is in compliance with the requirements stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule V and clauses (b) to (i) of Regulation 46(2) of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ( 'SEBI Listing Regulations' ), as applicable, with regard to corporate governance.\n\nTo further strengthen the Company's corporate governance philosophy, the Company has also adopted the Tata Business Excellence Model.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nThe Company has a strong legacy of fair, transparent and ethical governance practices.\n\nThe Company has adopted the Tata Code of Conduct ( 'TCoC/ Code' ) for Executive Directors ( 'EDs' ), Senior Management Personnel  and  other  Executives  and  Employees,  which  is available on the website of the Company www.tatasteel.com The Company has received con/firmations from the EDs as well as Senior Management Personnel regarding compliance of the Code during the year under review.

The familiarisation programme for our Directors is customised to suit their individual interests and area of expertise. The Directors are usually encouraged to visit the plant and raw material locations of the Company and interact with members of Senior Management as part of the induction programme. The  Senior  Management  make  presentations  giving  an overview of the Company's strategy, operations, products, markets, group structure and subsidiaries, Board constitution and guidelines, matters reserved for the Board and the major risks and risk management strategy. This enables the Directors to get a deep understanding of the Company, its people, values and culture and facilitates their active participation in overseeing the performance of the Management.\n\nAs stated in the Board's Report, the details of orientation given to our existing Independent Directors are available on  our  webite  https://www.tatasteel.com/media/12333/ familiarization-programme-for-independent-directors-forwebsite.pdf\n\n## Board Evaluation\n\nThe NRC has formulated a Policy for evaluation of the Board, its Committees and Directors and the same has been approved and adopted by the Board.

However, these cases are not material in nature.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodities are essential inputs to the manufacturing of steel. The dynamic geo-political landscape and climate change issues cause unpredictability in commodity outputs leading to volatility in commodity prices. This is an inherent market risk for the Company as it impacts the pro/fitability and cash /flows. However, steel prices, follow the trend of commodity prices, over a period which is a natural hedge to the business.\n\nThe Company meets 100% of its iron ore requirements in India, through its captive iron ore mines and about a quarter of its coking coal requirements from its coal mines. These captive mines provide a structural hedge to the price risk of these commodities.\n\nThe Company has a dedicated commodity sourcing team which  engages  with  key  raw  material  producers  across the globe and the commodity market at large to optimise sourcing. The team has identi/fied the risk of single geography sourcing  and  undertakes  periodic  risk  assessment  of  the supply chain. The team proactively works on diversi/fication of  vendors,  geographies,  development  of  substitutes  & new  products,  Vendor  Managed  Inventory  and  Value-InUse ( 'VIU' ) optimisation framework to mitigate the impact of single geography sourcing and other disruptions in the\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The dynamic VIU mapping with imported coal pricing is undertaken for advance planning and value maximisation.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has proactively taken measures to address the uncertainties and has made strategic shifts in its sourcing policy especially in relation to the key commodities. During the lockdown period, a strategic call\n\nwas taken to operate raw material mining operations. Supply chain disruptions were managed through obtaining necessary licenses to ensure movement of raw materials. A taskforce was formed to ensure preparedness across the organisation in terms of employee health and safety and continuity of operations.  To  reduce  dependence  on  global  commodity supply chains, captive coal, iron ore and pellet inventory were ramped up to reduce the buy post normalisation of operations and improve pro/fitability.\n\nTo address the short-term price volatility, the Company also hedges certain commodities in the derivatives market. Exposure of the Company to commodity and commodity risks faced by the Company throughout the year is as below:\n\n- 1.

Chandrasekaran, Chairman, has abstained from receiving commission from the Company and hence not stated.\n- (2) In line with the internal guidelines of the Company no payment is made towards commission to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company, who are in full time employment with any other Tata Company and hence not stated.\n- (3) The  ratio  of  remuneration  to  median  remuneration  is  based  on remuneration paid during the period April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021.\n- (4) Includes  the  Commission  /  bonus  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors for the Chief Executive O/fficer & Managing Director and Executive  Director  &  Chief  Financial  O/fficer  on  May  5,  2021  for FY 2020-21 (which will be paid to them on conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of 2021).\n\n- B. The percentage increase / (decrease) in the median remuneration of employees in the /financial year 2020-21: (8.42)\n- C. The number of permanent employees on the rolls of Company as on March 31, 2021: 31,189\n- D. Comparison of average percentile increase in salary of employees other than the managerial personnel and the percentile increase in the managerial remuneration:\n\nDuring the /financial year 2020-21, the average percentage increase / (decrease) in salary of the Company's employees, excluding the Key Managerial Personnel ('KMP') was (2.85%). The percentage increase / (decrease) in salary of KMPs during the same period (on actuals) was (6.01%).\n\nHowever, considering the Commission / bonus approved by the Board of Directors for the Chief Executive O/fficer & Managing Director and Executive Director & Chief Financial O/fficer on May 5, 2021 for /financial year 2020-21 (which will be paid to them on conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of 2021), the increase in managerial remuneration for the year is ~28%. The increase in managerial remuneration for /financial year 2020-21 is not comparable with /financial year 2019-20 owing to there being no increase in the managerial remuneration for /financial year 2019-20 in view of economic conditions impacted by  COVID-19  pandemic  wherein  the  Directors  decided  to moderate the executive remuneration for /financial year 201920 to express solidarity and conserve resources.\n\n- E. A/ffirmations: It is a/ffirmed that the remuneration paid to the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and other employees is as per the Remuneration Policy of the Company.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors\n\nsd/-\n\nN.

Tata Steel R&D in collaboration with a foreign university has developed a new  reagent which increases /floatability of lower seam coals by (i) increasing their C-C/C-H content on the  surface making it more hydrophobic and (ii) aggregating /finer coal particles to minimise porosity and  improving surface properties. An increase in /fine clean coal yield of 7.5% for lower seam coals was observed  as compared along with a decrease of 1% product ash content. The overall increase on ROM basis is 1%  with the new reagent. Pilot scale trials (capacity 400kg/hr) are under progress with di/fferent seam coals. |\n| Reduction of alumina in iron ore                            | The alumina reduction is about 1.2% in wet lumps and 0.2-0.4% in the classi/fier /fines through present  practice of the washing process. Addition of surface active reagents help to increase the washing e/fficiency  of iron ore. Test work with di/fferent dispersants showed that alumina could be reduced by 0.2-0.3% in  addition to the reduction achieved by washing with water alone. Two dispersants were selected for plant  scale trials based on lab scale experimentation. First phase of plant trials has been conducted for two                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Smart Lance System for LD vessel                            | weeks in February 2021 and second phase of trials has been scheduled from April 15, 2021. To improve blowing operation in LD vessel and avoid subjective assessment of the onset of slop by  operating personnel, a lance positioning and control system, known as Smart Lance was developed for LD  vessel using an audiometer to measure the process noise generated by oxygen jet impinging in the steel  bath.

We have audited the accompanying standalone /financial statements  of  Tata  Steel  Limited  ('the  Company'), which comprise the balance sheet as at March 31, 2021, and the statement of Pro/fit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), statement of changes in equity and statement of cash /flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone /financial statements, including a summary of signi/ficant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 'the Standalone Financial Statements').\n- 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone /financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of a/ffairs of the Company as at March 31, 2021, and total comprehensive income (comprising pro/fit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash /flows for the year then ended.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n- 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speci/fied under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the\n\nAudit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\n- 4. We draw your attention to Note 6(vi) to the standalone /financial statements which states that the ability of the Tata Steel Europe (TSE), the step-down subsidiary of T Steel Holdings Pte Ltd (TSH), a subsidiary of the Company, to continue as a going concern is dependent on the availability of future funding requirements, which could have a consequential impact on the carrying amount of investment of \u20b920,854.89 crore (net of provision for impairment amounting to \u20b9860.00 crore) in TSH as at March 31, 2021.\n\nFurther, the auditors of TSE have, without modifying their opinion, reported a Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern vide their report dated May 4, 2021 on the /financial information of TSE for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nOur opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.",

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the standalone /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Assessment  of  litigations  and  related  disclosure  of contingent liabilities\n\n[Refer to Note 2 (c) to the Standalone /financial statements'Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements Provisions and contingent liabilities', Note 36 (A) to the Standalone Financial Statements - 'Contingencies' and Note 37 to the Standalone /financial statements - 'Other signi/ficant litigations'].\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, the Company has exposures towards litigations  relating  to  various  matters  as  set  out  in  the aforesaid Notes.\n\nSigni/ficant management judgement is required to assess such matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material out/flow of economic resources and whether a provision should be recognised or a disclosure should be made. The management judgement is also supported with legal advice in certain cases as considered appropriate.\n\nAs the ultimate outcome of the matters are uncertain and the positions taken by the management are based on the application of their best judgement, related legal advice including those relating to interpretation of laws/regulations, it is considered to be a Key Audit Matter.\n\n## Our audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We understood, assessed and tested the design and operating  effectiveness  of  key  controls  surrounding assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 We discussed with management the recent developments and the status of the material litigations which were reviewed and noted by the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 We performed our assessment on a test basis on the underlying  calculations  supporting  the  contingent liabilities/other signi/ficant litigations disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements;\n- \u00b7 We  used  auditor's  experts/specialists  to  gain  an understanding and to evaluate the disputed tax matters;\n- \u00b7 We considered external legal opinions, where relevant, obtained by management;\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  management's  assessments  by understanding  precedents  set  in  similar  cases  and assessed  the  reliability  of  the  management's  past estimates/judgements;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's assessment around those matters that are not disclosed or not considered as contingent liability, as the probability of material out/flow is considered to be remote by the management; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed the adequacy of the Company's disclosures.\n\nBased on the above work performed, the assessment in respect of litigations and related disclosures relating to contingent  liabilities/other  significant  litigations  in  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  is  considered  to  be reasonable.\n\nLeadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also has made investments in preference shares in certain subsidiaries/ associates and debentures in a joint venture.\n\nThe Company accounts for equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at cost (subject to impairment assessment) and other investments at fair value.\n\nFor investments carried at cost amounting to \u20b928,444.61 crore where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying value of investment is assessed for impairment and where applicable an impairment provision is recognised.\n\nFor investments carried at fair values, a fair valuation is done at the year-end as required by Ind AS 109. In case of certain investments, cost is considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value since there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range as permitted under Ind AS 109.\n\nThe accounting for investments is a Key Audit Matter as the  determination  of  recoverable  value  for  impairment assessment/fair valuation involves signi/ficant management judgement and estimates.\n\nThe impairment assessment and fair valuation for such investments have been carried out by the management in accordance with Ind AS 36 and Ind AS 113 respectively. The key inputs and judgements involved in the impairment/ fair valuation assessment of unquoted investments include:\n\n- \u00b7 Forecast cash /flows including assumptions on growth rates\n- \u00b7 Discount rates\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate\n- \u00b7 Economic and entity speci/fic factors incorporated in the valuation.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding from the management, assessed and tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the Company's key controls over the impairment assessment and fair valuation of material investments.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's process regarding impairment assessment and fair valuation by involving auditor's valuation experts to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the valuation model including the independent assessment of the underlying assumptions relating to discount rate, terminal value etc.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the carrying value/fair value calculations of all  individually  material  investments,  where  applicable, to determine whether the valuations performed by the Company were within an acceptable range determined by us and the auditor's valuation experts.\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  the  cash  flow  forecasts  (with  underlying economic growth rate) by comparing them to the approved budgets and our understanding of the internal and external factors.\n- \u00b7 We checked the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the relevant data with the latest budgets, actual past results and other supporting documents.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the sensitivity analysis and evaluated whether any reasonably foreseeable change in assumptions could lead to impairment or material change in fair valuation.\n- \u00b7 We discussed with the component auditors of certain entities to develop an understanding of the operating performance and outlook used in their own valuation model and to assess consistency with the assumptions used in the model.\n- \u00b7 We  had  discussions  with  management  to  obtain  an understanding of the relevant factors in respect of certain investments carried at fair value where a wide range of fair values were possible due to various factors such as absence of recent observable transactions, restrictions on transfer of shares, existence of multiple valuation techniques, investee's varied nature of portfolio of investments for which signi/ficant estimates/judgements are required to arrive at fair value.\n- \u00b7 We have discussed the key assumptions and sensitivities for certain investments with those charged with governance.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nBased on the above procedures performed, we did not identify any signi/ficant exceptions in the management's assessment in  relation  to  the  carrying  value  of  equity  investments  in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and fair value of other investments.",

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Integrated Report, Board's Report along with its Annexures and Financial Highlights included in the Company's Annual Report (titled as 'Tata Steel Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2020-21') but does not include the /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone /financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone /financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the standalone /financial statements\n\n- 7. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone /financial statements that give a true and fair view of the /financial position, /financial performance, changes in equity and cash /flows of  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards speci/fied under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate  accounting  policies;  making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls, that were operating e/ffectively for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation  of  the  standalone  financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 8. In  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease\n\nLeadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's /financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone /financial statements\n\n- 9. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone /financial statements.\n- 10. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n- 12. We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n- 13.   From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the standalone financial  statements  of  the  current  period  and  are therefore  the  key  audit  matters.  We  describe  these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n- 14. As required by the Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2016 ('the Order'), issued by the Central Government of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the Annexure B a statement on the matters speci/fied in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the extent applicable.\n- 15. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that:\n- (a) We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.\n- (b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books.\n- (c) The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss (including other comprehensive income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and Cash Flow Statement dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the books of account.\n\n- (d) In our opinion, the aforesaid standalone /financial statements comply with the Accounting Standards speci/fied under Section 133 of the Act.\n- (e) On the basis of the written representations received from the directors taken on record by the Board of Directors, none of the directors is disquali/fied as on March 31, 2021 from being appointed as a director in terms of Section 164 (2) of the Act.\n- (f) With respect to the adequacy of the internal /financial controls  with  reference  to  standalone  financial statements  of  the  Company  and  the  operating e/ffectiveness of such controls, refer to our separate Report in 'Annexure A'.\n- (g) With respect to the other matters to be included in the Auditor's Report in accordance with Rule 11 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us:\n- i. The  Company  has  disclosed  the  impact  of pending litigations as on March 31, 2021, on its /financial position in its standalone /financial statements - Refer Notes 36(A) and 37 to the standalone /financial statements;\n- ii.

We have audited the internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements of Tata Steel Limited ('the Company') as of March 31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone /financial statements  of  the  Company  for  the  year  ended  on that date.\n\n## Management's  Responsibility  for  Internal  Financial Controls\n\n- 2. The  Company's  management  is  responsible  for establishing and maintaining internal /financial controls based on the internal control over /financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\n- 3. Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit\n- to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n- 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls system with reference to /financial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls system with reference to standalone /financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to /financial statements\n\n- 6. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of /financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisation of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the /financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Because of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial control controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\n- 8.

(a) The Company is maintaining proper records showing full particulars, including quantitative details and situation, of /fixed assets.\n- (b) The  fixed  assets  are  physically  verified  by  the Management according to a phased programme designed to cover all the items over a period of three years which, in our opinion, is reasonable having regard to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. Pursuant to the programme, a portion of the /fixed assets has been physically veri/fied by the Management during the year and no material discrepancies have been noticed on such veri/fication.\n- (c) According to the information and explanations given to us and the records examined by us, the title deeds of immovable properties, as disclosed in Note 3 on property, plant and equipment to the Standalone Financial Statements, are held in the name of the Company, except for:\n- (i) title deeds of freehold land with gross and net carrying amount of \u20b960.44 crore and title deeds of buildings with gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of \u20b983.48 crore and \u20b969.99 crore respectively, which are held in the name of erstwhile companies which have subsequently been amalgamated with the Company;\n- (ii) title deeds of freehold land with gross and net carrying amount of \u20b9202.54 crore and title deeds of buildings with gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of \u20b995.62 crore and \u20b968.37 crore respectively, which are not readily available.\n- ii. The physical veri/fication of inventory [excluding stocks with third parties] have been conducted at reasonable intervals by the Management during the year. In respect of inventory lying with third parties, these have substantially been con/firmed by them. In respect of inventories of stores and spares, the Management has a veri/fication programme designed to cover the items over a period of three years. The discrepancies noticed on physical veri/fication of inventory as compared to book records were not material.\n- iii. The  Company  has  not  granted  any  loans,  secured or  unsecured,  to  companies,  firms,  Limited  Liability\n- Partnerships or other parties covered in the register maintained under Section 189 of the Act. Therefore, the provisions of Clause 3(iii), (iii)(a), (iii)(b) and (iii)(c) of the said Order are not applicable to the Company.\n- iv. In our opinion, and according to the information and explanations given to us, the Company has complied with the provisions of Section 185 and 186 of the Companies Act, 2013 in respect of the loans and investments made, and guarantees and security provided by it, as applicable.\n- v. The Company has not accepted any deposits from the public within the meaning of Sections 73, 74, 75 and 76 of the Act and the Rules framed there under to the extent noti/fied.\n- vi. Pursuant to the rules made by the Central Government of India, the Company is required to maintain cost records as speci/fied under Section 148(1) of the Act in respect of its products. We have broadly reviewed the same, and are of the opinion that, prima facie, the prescribed accounts and records have been made and maintained. We have not, however, made a detailed examination of the records with a view to determine whether they are accurate or complete.\n- vii. (a) According to the information and explanations given to us and the records of the Company examined by us, in our opinion, except for dues in respect of income tax, the Company is generally regular in depositing undisputed statutory dues in respect of electricity duty, though there has been a slight delay in a few cases, and is regular in depositing undisputed  statutory  dues,  including  provident fund, employees' state insurance, sales tax, service tax, duty of customs, duty of excise, value added tax, cess, goods and services tax and other material statutory dues, as applicable, with the appropriate authorities. We are informed that the Company has applied for exemption from operations of Employee's State Insurance Act at some locations. We are also informed  that  actions  taken  by  the  authorities at some locations to bring the employees of the Company under the Employees' State Insurance Scheme has been contested by the Company and payment has not been made of the contribution demanded. Further, for the period April 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, the Company has paid Goods and Services Tax and /filed Form GSTR-3B after the due date but within the timelines allowed by Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs under the Noti/fications No. 31/2020 and 36/2020 dated April 3, 2020 on ful/filment of conditions speci/fied therein.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Company information\n\nTata Steel Limited ('the Company') is a public limited Company incorporated in India with its registered o/ffice in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on the BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE).\n\nThe Company has presence across the entire value chain of steel manufacturing from mining and processing iron ore and coal to producing and distributing /finished products. The Company o/ffers a broad range of steel products including a portfolio of high value added downstream products such as hot rolled, cold rolled, coated steel, rebars, wire rods, tubes and wires.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Company is Indian Rupee ('\u20b9') which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\n\nAs on March 31, 2021, Tata Sons Private Limited owns 32.93% of the Ordinary Shares of the Company, and has the ability to in/fluence the Company's operations.\n\nThe /financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 5, 2021.\n\n## 2. Signi/ficant accounting policies\n\nThe  significant  accounting  policies  applied  by  the Company in the preparation of its /financial statements are listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied consistently to all the periods presented in these /financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThe  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in accordance  with  the  Indian  Accounting  Standards (referred to as 'Ind AS') prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe /financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair value by Ind AS.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## (c) Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements\n\nIn the preparation of /financial statements, the Company makes  judgments  in  the  application  of  accounting policies; and estimates and assumptions which a/ffects the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  The  estimates and  associated  assumptions  are  based  on  historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods a/ffected.\n\nKey source of estimation of uncertainty at the date of /financial statements, which may cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, is in respect of impairment, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, provisions and contingent liabilities, fair value measurements of /financial instruments and retirement bene/fit obligations as discussed below:\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Company estimates the value in use of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on future cash /flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash /flows are developed using internal forecasts. The cash /flows are discounted using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Further details of the Company's impairment review and key assumptions are set out in note 3, page 268, note 4, page 271, note 5, page 273 and note 6, page 274.\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  at  the  end  of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods. The policy has been detailed in note 2(i), page 259.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. The policy has been detailed in note 2(u), page 265, and its further information are set out in note 10, page 286.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as result of a past event and it is probable that the out/flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimates. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the /financial statements. Further details are set out in note 21, page 302 and note 36A, page 317.\n\n## Fair value measurements of /financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of /financial assets and /financial liabilities  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  cannot  be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  Discounted  Cash  Flow  Model.  The  inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of  judgement  is  required  in  establishing  fair  value. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risks,  credit  risks  and  volatility.  Changes  in assumptions about these factors could a/ffect the reported fair value of /financial instruments. Further details are set out in note 39, page 323.\n\n## Retirement bene/fit obligations\n\nThe Company's retirement bene/fit obligations are subject to  number  of  assumptions  including  discount  rates, in/flation and salary growth. Signi/ficant assumptions are required when setting these criteria and a change in these assumptions would have a signi/ficant impact on the amount recorded in the Company's balance sheet and the statement of pro/fit and loss. The Company sets these assumptions based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice. Further details on the Company's retirement bene/fit obligations, including key judgements are set out in note 35, page 311.\n\n## Estimation of uncertainties relating to COVID-19\n\nThe Company has assessed the possible impact of COVID-19 on its /financial statements based on the internal and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexternal information available up to the date of approval of the /financial statements and concluded no adjustment is required in these /financial statements. The Company continues to monitor the future economic conditions.\n\n## (d) Property, plant and equipment\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. All other repair and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as incurred. When a replacement occurs, the carrying value  of  the  replaced  part  is  de-recognised.  Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having di/fferent useful lives, these components are accounted for as separate items.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes all direct costs and expenditures incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Trial run expenses are capitalised. Borrowing costs incurred during the period of construction is capitalised as part of cost of qualifying asset.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the di/fference between sale proceeds and carrying value of such item, and is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (e) Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\nExpenditures associated with search for speci/fic mineral resources are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets. The following expenditure comprises cost of exploration and evaluation assets:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining  of  the  rights  to  explore  and  evaluate mineral  reserves  and  resources  including  costs directly related to this acquisition\n- \u00b7 researching and analysing existing exploration data\n- \u00b7 conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling\n- \u00b7 examining  and  testing  extraction  and  treatment methods\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n- \u00b7 compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies\n- \u00b7 activities  in  relation  to  evaluating  the  technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource\n\nAdministration and other overhead costs are charged to the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only if directly related to an exploration and evaluation project.\n\nIf  a  project  does  not  prove  viable,  all  irrecoverable exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with the project net of any related impairment allowances is written o/ff to the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Company measures its exploration and evaluation assets  at  cost  and  classifies  as  property,  plant  and equipment or intangible assets according to the nature of the assets acquired and applies the classification consistently.  To  the  extent  that  a  tangible  asset  is consumed in developing an intangible asset, the amount re/flecting that consumption is capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible asset.\n\nAs the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All exploration and evaluation assets are monitored for indications of impairment. An exploration and evaluation asset is no longer classi/fied as such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable and the development of the  deposit  is  sanctioned  by  the  management.  The carrying value of such exploration and evaluation asset is reclassi/fied to mining assets.\n\n## (f) Development expenditure for mineral reserves\n\nDevelopment is the establishment of access to mineral reserves  and  other  preparations  for  commercial production.  Development  activities  often  continue during production and include:\n\n- \u00b7 sinking shafts and underground drifts (often called mine development)\n- \u00b7 making permanent excavations\n- \u00b7 developing passageways and rooms or galleries\n- \u00b7 building roads and tunnels and\n- \u00b7 advance removal of overburden and waste rock\n\nDevelopment  (or  construction)  also  includes  the installation of infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities and housing), machinery, equipment and facilities.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and presented as part of mining assets. No depreciation is charged on the development expenditure before the start of commercial production.\n\n## (g) Provision for restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe Company has liabilities related to restoration of soil and other related works, which are due upon the closure of certain of its mining sites.\n\nSuch liabilities are estimated case-by-case based on available information, taking into account applicable local legal requirements. The estimation is made using existing technology, at current prices, and discounted using an appropriate discount rate where the e/ffect of time value of money is material. Future restoration and environmental costs, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and the corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration and environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant and equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are depreciated over the life of the related asset. The e/ffect of time value of money on the restoration and environmental costs liability is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (h) Intangible assets\n\nPatents, trademarks and software costs are included in the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable that associated future economic bene/fits would /flow to the Company. In this case they are measured initially at purchase cost and then amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. All other costs on patents, trademarks and software are expensed in the statement of pro/fit and loss as and when incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Costs incurred on individual development projects are recognised as intangible assets from the date when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- (i) completion  of  the  development  is  technically feasible.\n- (ii) it is the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n- (iii) ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- (iv)    it is clear that the intangible asset will generate probable future economic bene/fits.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n- (v) adequate technical, /financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available.\n- (vi)    it is possible to reliably measure the expenditure attributable  to  the  intangible  asset  during  its development.\n\nRecognition of costs as an asset is ceased when the project is complete and available for its intended use, or if these criteria are no longer applicable.\n\nWhere development activities do not meet the conditions for recognition as an asset, any associated expenditure is treated as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with de/finite useful lives are reported at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## (i) Depreciation  and  amortisation  of  property,  plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets\n\nDepreciation or amortisation is provided so as to write o/ff, on a straight-line basis, the cost/deemed cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including right-of-use assets to their residual value. These charges are commenced from the dates the assets are available for their intended use and are spread over their estimated useful economic lives or, in the case of right-of-use assets, over the lease period, if shorter. The estimated useful lives of assets, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed regularly and, when necessary, revised.\n\nDepreciation on assets under construction commences only when the assets are ready for their intended use.\n\nThe estimated useful lives for main categories of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are:\n\n| Buildings                                                                            | Estimated useful   life (years) upto 60 years*   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Roads                                                                                | 5 years                                          |\n| Plant and machinery                                                                  | upto 40 years*                                   |\n| Railway sidings                                                                      | upto 35 years*                                   |\n| Vehicles and aircraft                                                                | 5 to 20 years                                    |\n| Furniture, /fixtures and o/ffice equipments                                          | 4 to 6 years                                     |\n| Computer software                                                                    | 5 years                                          |\n| Assets covered under Electricity Act (life as  prescribed under the Electricity Act) | 3 to 34 years                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMining assets are amortised over the useful life of the mine or lease period whichever is lower.\n\nMajor furnace relining expenses are depreciated over a period of 10 years (average expected life).\n\nFreehold land is not depreciated.\n\nAssets value upto \u20b925,000 are fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.\n\n*For these class of assets, based on internal assessment and independent technical evaluation carried out by chartered engineers, the Company believes that the useful lives as given above best represents the period over which the Company expects to use these assets. Hence the useful lives for these assets are di/fferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (j) Impairment\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable through continuing use. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is reviewed in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash /flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable  amount  is  the  higher  of  fair  value  less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as and when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount  so  that  the  increased  carrying  value  does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss immediately.\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (k) Leases\n\nThe  Company  determines  whether  an  arrangement contains a lease by assessing whether the ful/filment of a transaction is dependent on the use of a speci/fic asset and whether the transaction conveys the right to control the use of that asset to the Company in return for payment.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  each  lease  component within the contract as a lease separately from nonlease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. The Company recognises right-of-use  asset  representing  its  right  to  use  the underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  at  the  lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception comprises of the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment  losses,  if  any  and  adjusted  for  any re-measurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nLease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate.  The  lease  liability  is  subsequently  remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to re/flect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to\n\nre/flect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to re/flect any reassessment or lease modi/fications. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nVariable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are expensed to the statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which the events or conditions which trigger those payments occur.\n\nIn  a  sale  and  lease  back  transaction,  the  Company measures right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback as the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right-of-use retained. The gain or loss that the company recognises in the statement of pro/fit and loss is limited to the proportion of the total gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\n- (i) Operating lease Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss on a straight- line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic bene/fits from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (ii) Finance  lease  When assets are leased out under a  finance  lease,  the  present  value  of  minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the present value of receivable is recognised as unearned /finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which re/flects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## (l) Stripping costs\n\nThe Company separates two di/fferent types of stripping costs that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n\n- \u00b7 developmental stripping costs and\n- \u00b7 production stripping costs",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nDevelopmental stripping costs which are incurred in order to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves that will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part of mining assets. Capitalisation of developmental stripping costs ends when the commercial production of the mineral reserves begins.\n\nA mine can operate several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning and production. In this case, stripping costs are accounted for separately, by reference to the ore extracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning and production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\nThe determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's speci/fic circumstances. The following factors normally point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- \u00b7 mining  of  the  second  and  subsequent  pits  is conducted consecutively with that of the /first pit, rather than concurrently\n- \u00b7 separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset\n- \u00b7 the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n- \u00b7 the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\nThe relative importance of each factor is considered by the management to determine whether, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.\n\nProduction stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore in the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an additional component of an ore body or deeper levels of material. Production stripping costs are accounted for as inventories to the extent the bene/fit from production stripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company recognises a stripping activity asset in the production phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will /flow to the Company\n- \u00b7 the Company can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and\n- \u00b7 the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nSuch costs are presented within mining assets. After initial recognition, stripping activity assets are carried at cost/deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. The expected useful life of the identi/fied component of the ore body is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping asset.\n\n## (m)   Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are carried at cost/deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of investment is assessed and an impairment provision is recognised, if required immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of such investments, di/fference between the net disposal proceeds and carrying amount is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (n) Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of  the  instrument.  Financial  assets  and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /financial assets and /financial liabilities (other than /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of /financial asset or /financial liability. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss are immediately recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## E/ffective interest method\n\nThe e/ffective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The e/ffective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the /financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.\n\n## (I) Financial assets\n\n## Cash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances consist of:\n\n- (i) Cash and cash equivalents which includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, are subject to an insigni/ficant risk of change in value and have original maturities of less than one year. These balances with banks are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n- (ii)    Other bank balances which includes balances and deposits with banks that are restricted for withdrawal and usage.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at amortised cost if these /financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if such /financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and to sell such /financial assets and the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThe  Company  in  respect  of  equity  investments (other  than  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint ventures)  which  are  not  held  for  trading  has made an irrevocable election to present in other\n\ncomprehensive  income  subsequent  changes  in the fair value of such equity instruments. Such an election is made by the Company on an instrument by instrument basis at the time of initial recognition of such equity investments. These investments are held for medium or long-term strategic purpose. The Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as fair value through other comprehensive income as the management believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than re/flecting changes in fair value immediately in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are carried at fair value through pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Interest  income\n\nInterest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and e/ffective interest rate applicable.\n\n## Dividend  income\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised when  the  right  to  receive  payment  has  been established.\n\nImpairment of /financial assets\n\nLoss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised for /financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Company recognises life time expected credit losses for all trade receivables that do not constitute a /financing transaction.\n\nFor /financial assets (apart from trade receivables that do not constitute of /financing transaction) whose credit risk has not signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition, loss allowance equal to twelve months expected credit losses is recognised. Loss allowance equal  to  the  lifetime  expected  credit  losses  is recognised if the credit risk of the /financial asset has signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition.\n\nDe-recognition of /financial assets\n\nThe Company de-recognises a /financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from",

The instruments are con/fined principally to forward foreign exchange contracts,  cross  currency  swaps,  interest  rate  swaps and collars. The instruments are employed as hedges of transactions included in the /financial statements or for highly probable forecast transactions//firm contractual commitments.  These  derivatives  contracts  do  not generally extend beyond six months, except for certain currency swaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Company adopts hedge accounting for forward foreign exchange and interest rate contracts wherever possible. At inception of each hedge, there is a formal, documented designation of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes, inter alia, items such as identi/fication of the hedged item and transaction and nature of the risk being hedged. At inception, each hedge is expected to be highly e/ffective in achieving an o/ffset of changes in fair value or cash /flows attributable to the hedged risk. The e/ffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ine/ffective portion of designated hedges is recognised immediately in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n\n- \u00b7 for  fair  value  hedges  of  recognised  assets  and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss and compensate for the e/ffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives.\n- \u00b7 for cash /flow hedges, the e/ffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ine/ffective portion is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.

For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item a/ffects the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as and when they arise.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised  in  equity  is  retained  in  equity  until  the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\n## (o) Employee bene/fits\n\n## De/fined contribution plans\n\nContributions  under  defined  contribution  plans  are recognised  as  expense  for  the  period  in  which  the employee has rendered service. Payments made to state managed retirement bene/fit schemes are dealt with as payments to de/fined contribution schemes where the Company's obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a de/fined contribution retirement bene/fit scheme.\n\n## De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nFor de/fined bene/fit retirement schemes, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuation being carried out at each year-end balance sheet date. Remeasurement gains and losses of the net de/fined bene/fit liability/(asset) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) are recognised as an expense within employee costs.\n\nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related restructuring costs or termination bene/fits are recognised, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligations as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.\n\n## Compensated absences\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised based on actuarial valuation at the present value of the obligation as on the reporting date.\n\n## (p) Inventories\n\nInventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net realisable  value.  Cost  is  ascertained  on  a  weighted average basis. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the cost of conversion from their existing state to a /finished condition and for the cost of marketing, selling and distribution.\n\nProvisions are made to cover slow-moving and obsolete items based on historical experience of utilisation on a  product  category  basis,  which  involves  individual businesses considering their product lines and market conditions.\n\n## (q) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, which is expected to result in an out/flow of resources embodying economic bene/fits which can be reliably estimated. Each provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured on a discounted basis.\n\nConstructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\n- (i) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a su/fficiently speci/fic current statement,",

The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.\n\n## (s) Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at its fair value, where there is a reasonable assurance that such grants will be received and compliance with the conditions attached therewith have been met.\n\nGovernment grants related to expenditure on property, plant and equipment are credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss over the useful lives of qualifying assets or other systematic basis representative of the pattern of ful/filment of obligations associated with the grant received. Grants received less amounts credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss at the reporting date are included in the balance sheet as deferred income.\n\n## (t) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classi/fied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAssets and disposal groups are classi/fied as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction  rather  than  through  continuing  use.  This condition is only met when the sale is highly probable and the asset, or disposal group, is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Company must also be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classi/fication.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhere a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, then it is treated as a discontinued operation. The post-tax pro/fit or loss of the discontinued operation together with the gain or loss recognised on its disposal are disclosed as a single amount in the statement of pro/fit and loss, with all prior periods being presented on this basis.\n\n## (u) Income taxes\n\nTax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro/fit for the year. Taxable pro/fit di/ffers from net pro/fit as reported in the statement of pro/fit and loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  the  tax  expected  to  be  payable  or recoverable on di/fferences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the /financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro/fit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences.  In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su/fficient taxable pro/fits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets re/flects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped or delivered to the speci/fic location as the case may be, the risks of loss has been transferred, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satis/fied. Sale of products include related ancillary services, if any.\n\nGoods are often sold with volume discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price speci/fied in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the most likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal will not occur. A liability is recognised for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of /financing is deemed present as the sales are generally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which is consistent with market practice. Any obligation to provide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\nThe Company does not adjust the transaction prices for any time value of money in case of contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer does not exceeds one year.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nRevenue from sale of power is recognised when the services are provided to the customer based on approved tariff  rates  established  by  the  respective  regulatory authorities. The Company doesn't recognise revenue and an asset for cost incurred in the past that will be recovered.\n\n## (w)  Foreign currency transactions and translations\n\nThe /financial statements of the Company are presented in Indian Rupees ('\u20b9'), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the /financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period,  monetary  items  denominated  in  foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

Premiums payable on early redemptions of debt securities, in lieu of future /finance costs, are recognised as borrowing costs.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## (y) Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing pro/fit or loss for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid up shares are included as fully paid equivalents according to the fraction paid up.\n\nLeadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiluted  earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares except where the result would be anti-dilutive.\n\n## (z) Recent accounting pronouncements\n\n## Amendment  to  Ind  AS  116  'Leases'  -  Insertion of  practical  expedient  for  COVID-19  related  lease concessions\n\nThe amendment provides lessee with a practical expedient and an exemption to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession is a lease modi/fication to payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021. Amendment also requires disclosure of the amount recognised in statement of pro/fit and loss to re/flect changes in lease payments that arise from such concession. The Company has not recognised any amount as reversal of lease liability in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and Ind AS 107 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' - Interest rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe Company has applied the related amendments. The amendments provide relief from the speci/fic hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate  benchmark  reform.  The  Company  is  currently evaluating  the  potential  impact  of  replacement  of interest rate benchmark and will accordingly manage the transition plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Right-of-use assets (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. I(c), Page 250]\n\nLease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of di/fferent terms and conditions. Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Company to sublet the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Company. Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases. These are used to maximise operational /flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company's operations. Majority of the extension and termination options held are exercisable based on mutual agreement of the Company and the respective lessor.\n\nWith the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is re/flected on the balance sheet as a right-of use asset and a lease liability. Payments made under such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nVariable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate (such as lease payments based on a percentage of sales) are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and asset.\n\nFor leases recognised under long-term arrangements involving use of a dedicated asset, non-lease components are excluded based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. A change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on the measurement of lease liabilities and the related right-of-use assets.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recognised the following in the statement of pro/fit and loss:\n\n- a) expense in respect of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets \u20b9 6.73 crore (2019-20: \u20b932.18 crore) and \u20b9 0.33 crore (2019- 20: \u20b91.21 crore) respectively.\n- b) expense in respect of variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities \u20b9 60.96 crore (201920: \u20b981.99 crore).\n- c) income in respect of sub-leases of right-of-use assets \u20b9 0.53 crore (2019-20: \u20b90.71 crore).\n- d) loss on sale and leaseback transaction entered during the year Nil (2019-20: \u20b90.45 crore).\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, total cash out/flow in respect of leases amounted to \u20b9 799.64 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9729.29 crore).\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, commitments for leases not yet commenced was \u20b9 201.13 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9335.44 crore).",

Ltd. (TSH) and NatSteel Asia Pte. Ltd. where indicators of impairment were identi/fied, the Company estimated the recoverable amount based on the value in use of the underlying businesses. The computation uses cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved /financial budgets and strategic forecasts which cover a period of three years and future projections taking the analysis out into perpetuity. Key assumptions for the value in use computations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, exchange rates, market demand, expected changes to selling prices, raw material and other direct costs. Changes in selling prices, raw material costs, exchange rates and demand are based on historical experience and expectations of future changes in the market. Beyond the speci/fically forecasted period, a growth rate of 1.25 % (March 31, 2020: 1.25%) is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.\n\nTata Steel Europe (TSE) (a wholly owned subsidiary of T Steel Holdings Pte. Ltd.) is exposed to climate risks through the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) which is applicable to all steel plant within Europe. Given that most European steel producers have not been heavily a/ffected by CO 2 compliance costs to date, TSE's best estimate is that the increased costs of future CO 2 compliance will be passed on to end customers through higher steel selling prices. TSE has a stated ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050 and is considering its future strategy on operating processes while continuing to serve its customers. The technology transition and investments will be dependent on national and international policy which is evolving. Further, the Netherlands' government has enacted legislation for a local additional carbon tax (linked to the EU ETS scheme CO 2 allowances and traded prices), but costs under this tax is not expected until /financial year 2024-25 at the earliest and are not included in the annual plan. Management's assessment is that generally, these potential carbon-related costs would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through public spending/ subsidies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the improvement in outlook for European steel market, while there is a reasonable expectation that TSE has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future and that the going concern basis for the preparation of its /financial statements remains appropriate, there exists a material uncertainty in respect of Tata Steel UK Limited (TSUK), a subsidiary of the Company held through TSE. The management, however, continues to implement various measures aimed at conserving cash and improving the liquidity requirements at TSUK.\n\nThe Company estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that re/flect the current market rates for investments of similar risk. The rate for these investments were estimated from the weighted average cost of capital of participants, which operate a portfolio of assets similar to those of the Company's assets. The weighted average pre-tax discount rates used for discounting the cash /flows projections was 8.10 % (March 31, 2020: 8.00%).\n\nThe outcome of the test as on March 31, 2021 resulted in the Company recognizing no impairment loss with respect to investment in T Steel Holdings Pte. Ltd. (TSH) (2019-20: \u20b9860.00 crore) and NatSteel Asia Pte. Ltd. (2019-20: \u20b9126.00 crore). The Company has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests in respect of investment held in TSH, including sensitivity in respect of inability to fully pass on the Netherlands carbon tax through higher selling prices. The management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the assessment would cause the carrying value of such investment to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\nIn respect of the Company's investment in Tata Steel Special Economic Zone Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which has been classi/fied as held for sale as on March 31, 2021, an impairment reversal \u20b9 150.00 crore (2019-20: impairment loss \u20b9150.00 crore) has been recognized during the year based on the fair value which is higher than the current carrying amount.",

Employee bene/fits\n\n## A. De/fined contribution plans\n\nThe Company participates in a number of de/fined contribution plans on behalf of relevant personnel. Any expense recognised in relation to these schemes represents the value of contributions payable during the period by the Company at rates speci/fied by the rules of those plans. The only amounts included in the balance sheet are those relating to the prior months contributions that were not due to be paid until after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe major de/fined contribution plans operated by the Company are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nThe Company provides provident fund bene/fits for eligible employees as per applicable regulations wherein both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the eligible employee's salary. Contributions under such schemes are made either to a provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees or to state managed funds.\n\nBene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to state managed funds and the Company does not have a future obligation to make good short fall if any, are treated as a de/fined contribution plan.\n\n## (b) Superannuation fund\n\nThe Company has a superannuation plan for the bene/fit of its employees. Employees who are members of the superannuation plan are entitled to bene/fits depending on the years of service and salary drawn.\n\nSeparate irrevocable trusts are maintained for employees covered and entitled to bene/fits. The Company contributes up to 15% of the eligible employees' salary or \u20b91,50,000, whichever is lower, to the trust every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The Company does not have any further obligation beyond this contribution.\n\nThe contributions recognised as an expense in the statement of pro/fit and loss during the year on account of the above de/fined contribution plans amounted to \u20b9 171.01 crore (2019-20: \u20b9178.78 crore).\n\n## B. De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans operated by the Company are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nProvident fund bene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to an irrevocable trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees are treated as a de/fined bene/fit plan as the Company is obligated to provide the members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company's contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in pro/fit and loss under employee bene/fits expense.\n\nIn accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities based on guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no de/ficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.\n\nKey assumptions used for actuarial valuation are as below:\n\n|                                       | As at  March 31, 2021   | As at  March 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Discount rate                         | 6.50%                   | 6.50%                   |\n| Guaranteed rate of return             | 8.50%                   | 8.50%                   |\n| Expected rate of return on investment | 8.00%                   | 8.40%                   |\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\n## (b) Retiring gratuity\n\nThe Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump- sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of /five years of service. The Company makes annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts or insurance companies. The Company accounts for the liability for gratuity bene/fits payable in the future based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (c) Post-retirement medical bene/fits\n\nUnder this unfunded scheme, employees of the Company receive medical bene/fits subject to certain limits on amounts of bene/fits, periods after retirement and types of bene/fits, depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company under an early separation scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The Company accounts for the liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (d)   Other de/fined bene/fits\n\nOther bene/fits provided under unfunded schemes include post-retirement lumpsum bene/fits, pension payable to directors of the Company on their retirement, farewell gifts and reimbursement of packing and transportation charges to the employees based on their last drawn salary.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans expose the Company to a number of actuarial risks as below:\n\n- (i) Investment  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government bond yields. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan de/ficit.\n- (ii) Interest  risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of plan's debt investments.\n- (iii) Salary  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.\n\nAs such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n\n- (iv) Longevity risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n\n## C.

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on prescribed investment criteria and is also subject to other exposure limitations. The Company evaluates the risks, transaction costs and liquidity for potential investments. To measure plan assets performance, the Company compares actual returns for each asset category with published benchmarks.\n\n- (iii) Key assumptions used in the measurement of retiring gratuity is as below:\n\n|                              | As at  March 31, 2021   | As at  March 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Discount rate                | 6.50%                   | 6.50%                   |\n| Rate of escalation in salary | 7.00% to 12.00%         | 7.50% to 10.00%         |\n\n## As at March 31, 2021\n\n| Assumption                   | Change in assumption           | Impact on obligation                                 |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                | Increase by 1%, decrease by 1% | Decrease by \u20b9211.58 crore, increase by \u20b9245.08 crore |\n| Rate of escalation in salary | Increase by 1%, decrease by 1% | Increase by \u20b9238.60 crore, decrease by \u20b9210.35 crore |\n\n## As at March 31, 2020\n\n| Assumption                   | Change in assumption           | Impact on obligation                                 |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                | Increase by 1%, decrease by 1% | Decrease by \u20b9222.21 crore, increase by \u20b9258.25 crore |\n| Rate of escalation in salary | Increase by 1%, decrease by 1% | Increase by \u20b9252.24 crore, decrease by \u20b9222.21 crore |\n\nThe above sensitivities may not be representative of the actual change as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.",

Contingencies and commitments\n\n## A. Contingencies\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Company assesses  such  claims  and  assertions  and  monitors the legal environment on an on-going basis with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its /financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Company provides disclosure in the /financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.\n\nThe following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. The Company believes that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse e/ffect on the Company's /financial condition, results of operations or cash /flows.\n\nIt is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of the cash out/flows, if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings. The Company does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the same.\n\n## Litigations\n\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, both as plainti/ff and as defendant.

The said demand has been challenged by the Company before the Jharkhand High Court.\n\nThe mining operations were suspended from August 1, 2014.

The Company, has paid \u20b950.00 crore under protest on July 27, 2015, because the State had stopped issuance of transit permits.\n\nThe company /filed another writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand which was heard on September 9, 2015. An interim order was given by the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand on September 17, 2015 wherein the Court has directed the Company to pay the amount of \u20b9371.83 crore in 3 equal instalments, /first instalment by October 15, 2015, second instalment by November 15, 2015 and third instalment by December 15, 2015.\n\nIn view of the interim order of the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand \u20b9124.00 crore was paid on September 28, 2015, \u20b9124.00 crore on November 12, 2015 and \u20b9123.83 crore on December 14, 2015 under protest.\n\nThe case is pending before the Hon'ble High court for disposal. The State issued similar terms and conditions to other mining lessees in the State rendering the mining as illegal.

This Level consists of investment in quoted equity shares and mutual funds.\n\nValuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2) : This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). This Level of hierarchy includes the Company's over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.\n\nValuation techniques with signi/ficant unobservable inputs (Level 3) : This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair value is determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. This Level includes investment in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.",

Key inputs to the valuation model are expected cash /flows and discount rate expected for an instrument with similar terms and maturity as on the reporting date.\n\n- (iv)    Fair value of investments in preference share of Tata Steel BSL Limited is dependent on its pro/fitability and cash /flows available for distribution. The expected cash /flows have been discounted considering a pre-tax discount rate of 13.84 % (March 31, 2020: 11.90%). The fair value is sensitive to changes in discount rate and pro/fitability. An increase in cash /flow by 1% would lead to an increase in fair value of preference shares by \u20b9 452.35 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9169.30 crore) and increase in discount rate by 1% would lead to decrease in fair value by \u20b9 1,376.01 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b91,444.90 crore).\n\nStakeholders and Materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n- (v) Fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price which is categorised as Level1. Fair value of borrowings which do not have an active market or are unquoted is estimated by discounting expected future cash /flows using a discount rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return adjusted for credit spread considered by lenders for instruments of similar maturities which is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n- (vi)    Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its /financial instruments.

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## (d) Transfer of /financial assets\n\nThe  Company  transfers  certain  trade  receivables under discounting arrangements with banks//financial institutions. Some of such arrangements do not qualify for de-recognition due to recourse arrangements being in place. Consequently, the proceeds received from transfer are recorded as short-term borrowings from banks and /financial institutions. As at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, there has been no such transfer of trade receivables.\n\n## (e) Financial risk management\n\nIn the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to /fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its /financial instruments.\n\nThe Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the /financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to:\n\n- (i) create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate /fluctuations on the Company's business plan.\n- (ii) achieve  greater  predictability  to  earnings  by determining the /financial value of the expected earnings in advance.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realising fair values or in future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price /fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future speci/fic market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\n## (a) Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\nThe /fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potential impact on the statement of pro/fit and loss and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign  exchange  and  other  derivative  instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the Company's cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of /financing the Company's capital expenditures.\n\nA 10% appreciation/depreciation of foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the Company would result in an increase/decrease in the Company's net pro/fit/ equity before considering tax impacts by approximately \u20b9 832.49 crore for the year ended March 31, 2021 (March 31, 2020: \u20b9158.75 crore) and an increase/decrease in carrying value of property, plant and equipment (before considering depreciation) by approximately Nil as at March 31, 2021 (March 31, 2020: \u20b9109.94 crore).\n\nThe foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by assuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been based on the composition of the Company's /financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other derivative and non-derivative /financial instruments (except investment in preference shares and loans receivable) not forming part of debt and which do not present a material exposure. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average balance outstanding during the period.\n\n## (b) Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by using the cash /flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Company's cash /flows as well as costs. The Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Company's interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\nBased on the composition of debt as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would increase the Company's /finance costs (before considering interest eligible for capitalisation) and thereby reduce net pro/fit/equity before considering tax impacts by approximately \u20b9 100.91 crore for the year ended March 31, 2021 (2019-20: \u20b9149.37 crore).\n\nThe risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves.

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\ncalculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (c) Market risk - Equity price risk:\n\nEquity price risk is related to change in market reference price of investments in equity securities held by the Company.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments held by the Company exposes the Company to equity price risks. In general, these investments are not held for trading purposes.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments in equity, classi/fied as fair value through other comprehensive income as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 was \u20b9 537.85 crore and \u20b9204.31 crore, respectively.\n\nA 10% change in equity prices of such securities held as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, would result in an impact of \u20b9 53.79 crore and \u20b920.43 crore respectively on equity before considering tax impact.\n\n## (ii) Credit risk:\n\nCredit risk is the risk of /financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nThe Company has a policy of dealing only with credit worthy counter parties and obtaining su/fficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of /financial loss from defaults.\n\nFinancial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  credit  risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade receivables,  loans  receivables,  investments  in  debt securities and mutual funds, balances with bank, bank deposits, derivatives and /financial guarantees provided by the Company. None of the /financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk except preference shares investments and loans, the Company made in its subsidiary companies.\n\nThe carrying value of /financial assets represents the maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk was \u20b9 43,313.30 crore and \u20b927,722.94 crore, as at\n\nMarch 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank deposits, investments in debt securities, mutual funds, loans, derivative assets and other /financial assets.\n\nThe risk relating to trade receivables is presented in note 13, page 289.\n\nThe Company's exposure to customers is diversi/fied and no single customer, other than a subsidiary, contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.\n\nIn  respect  of  financial  guarantees  provided  by  the Company to banks//financial institutions, the maximum exposure  which  the  Company  is  exposed  to  is  the maximum amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.\n\n## (iii) Liquidity risk:\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its /financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain su/fficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.\n\nThe Company has obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks. Furthermore, the Company have access to undrawn lines of committed and uncommitted borrowing/ facilities, funds from debt markets  through  commercial  paper  programs,  nonconvertible debentures and other debt instruments. The Company invests its surplus funds in bank /fixed deposits and in mutual funds, which carry no or low market risk. The Company has also invested 15% of the nonconvertible debentures (issued by the Company) falling due for repayment in the next 12 months in bank deposits, to meet the regulatory norms of liquidity requirements. The Company also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets with a view to maintaining /financial /flexibility.\n\nThe  Company's  liquidity  position  remains  strong  at \u20b9 14,180.59 crore  as  at  March  31,  2021,  comprising \u20b9 8,130.47 crore in the form of current investments, cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  other  balances  with banks (including non-current earmarked balances) and \u20b9 6,050.12 crore in committed undrawn bank lines.",

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements of Tata Steel Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group'), its associates and jointly controlled entities [refer note 1 to the attached Consolidated Financial Statements], which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021, the Consolidated Statement of  Profit  and  Loss  (including  Other  Comprehensive Income),  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Changes  in Equity and the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement for the year then ended, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including a summary of signi/ficant accounting policies and other explanatory information prepared based on the relevant records. (hereinafter referred to as 'the Consolidated Financial Statements').\n- 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of a/ffairs of the Group, its associates and jointly controlled entities as at March 31, 2021, its consolidated total comprehensive income (comprising pro/fit and other comprehensive income),  its  consolidated  changes  in  equity  and  its consolidated cash /flows for the year then ended.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n- 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speci/fied under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in India in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by ICAI and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have\n\nobtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 18 of the Other Matters paragraph below, other than the unaudited /financial statements/ /financial information as certi/fied by the management and referred to in paragraph 19 and /financial information not available as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Other Matters paragraph below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern\n\n- 4. The following Material Uncertainty Relating to Going Concern (as reproduced) has been communicated to us by the auditors of Tata Steel Europe Limited, a subsidiary of the Holding Company, vide their audit report dated May 4, 2021:\n\n'Without modifying our opinion on the special purpose /financial information, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made in the special purpose /financial information Tata Steel Europe Limited's ability to continue as a going concern. The impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic will require Tata Steel Europe Limited to access group company support in order to meet its obligations as they fall due. Tata Steel Europe Limited has received a letter from TS Global Procurement Company Pte Ltd undertaking to provide working capital and/or other cash support up to a speci/fied amount which exceeds the amount forecast as being required by Tata Steel Europe Limited over the next twelve months. The letter states that it represents present policy, is given by way of comfort only and is not to be construed as constituting a promise as to the future conduct of TS Global Procurement Company Pte Ltd or Tata Steel Limited. Accordingly, there can be no certainty that the funds required by Tata Steel Europe Limited will in fact be made available. These conditions, along with other matters explained in the special purpose /financial information, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast signi/ficant doubt about Tata Steel Europe Limited's ability to continue as a going concern. The special purpose /financial information does not include the adjustments that would result if Tata Steel Europe Limited was unable to continue as a going concern.'\n\nAlso, refer note 48 to the consolidated /financial statements in this regard.",

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Assessment  of  litigations  and  related  disclosure  of contingent liabilities\n\n[Refer to Note 2 (c) to the Consolidated /financial statements 'Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements  Provisions and contingent liabilities', Note 38 (A) to the Consolidated /financial statements - 'Contingencies' and Note 39 to the Consolidated /financial statements - 'Other signi/ficant litigations'].\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, the Holding Company has exposures towards litigations relating to various matters as set out in the aforesaid Notes.\n\nSigni/ficant management judgement is required to assess such matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material out/flow of economic resources and whether a provision should be recognised, or a disclosure should be made. The management judgement is also supported with legal advice in certain cases as considered appropriate. As the ultimate outcome of the matters are uncertain and the positions taken by the management are based on the application of their best judgement, related legal advice including those relating to interpretation of laws/regulations, it is considered to be a Key Audit Matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We understood, assessed and tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the Holding Company's key controls surrounding assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 We discussed with management the recent developments and the status of the material litigations which were reviewed and noted by the Holding Company's Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 We performed our assessment on a test basis on the underlying  calculations  supporting  the  contingent liabilities/other  significant  litigations  disclosed  in relation to the Holding Company's Standalone Financial Statements;\n- \u00b7 We  used  auditor's  experts  /  specialist  to  gain  an understanding and to evaluate the disputed tax matters;\n- \u00b7 We considered external legal opinions, where relevant, obtained by management;\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  management's  assessments  by understanding  precedents  set  in  similar  cases  and assessed  the  reliability  of  the  management's  past estimates/judgements;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's assessment around those matters that are not disclosed or not considered as contingent liability, as the probability of material out/flow is considered to be remote by the management; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures.\n\nBased on the above work performed, the management's assessment in respect of Holding Company's litigations and related disclosures relating to contingent liabilities/ other signi/ficant litigations in the Consolidated Financial Statements is considered to be reasonable.\n\nAlso refer to the Key Audit Matters included by us in our audit report of even date on the standalone /financial statements of the Holding Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for  the  other  information.  The  other  information comprises the information in the Integrated Report, Board's Report along with its Annexures and Financial Highlights included in the Holding Company's Annual Report (titled as 'Tata Steel Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2020-21'), but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n- 8. Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n- 9. In  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed and the reports of the other auditors as furnished to us (Refer\n\nparagraph 18 below), we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- 10. The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated /financial position, consolidated /financial performance consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash /flows of the Group including its associates and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards speci/fied under section 133 of the Act.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n- 12.   The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the financial  reporting  process  of  the  Group  and  of  its associates and jointly controlled entities.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- 13. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- 14. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and jointly controlled entities to express an opinion on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the /financial statements of such entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  which  we  are  the  independent auditors.  For  the  other  entities  included  in  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  which  have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding company, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and jointly controlled companies, to whom reporting under clause (i) of sub section 3 of Section 143 of the Act in respect of the adequacy of the internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal /financial controls based on internal control over /financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence\n\nto the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\n- 3. Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n- 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls system with reference to consolidated /financial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls system with reference to consolidated /financial statements.",

A company's internal /financial control with reference to /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial control with reference to /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of /financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the /financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to /financial statements\n\n- 7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial control with  reference  to  financial  statements  may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nLeadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapitals\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opinion\n\n- 8. In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and jointly controlled companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal /financial controls system with reference to /financial statements and  such  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to /financial statements were operating e/ffectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over /financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- 9. Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating e/ffectiveness of the internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements insofar as it relates to thirteen subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India. Our opinion is not quali/fied in respect of this matter.\n\n## For Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP\n\nFirm Registration Number: 304026E/ E-300009 Chartered Accountants\n\n## Russell I Parera\n\nPartner\n\nPlace: Mumbai\n\nMembership Number: 042190 UDIN: 21042190AAAABN7533\n\nDate: May 5, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

Company Information\n\nTata Steel Limited ('the Company') is a public limited Company incorporated in India with its registered o/ffice in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on the BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE).\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'the Group') have presence across the entire value chain of steel manufacturing from mining and processing iron ore and coal to producing and distributing /finished products. The Group o/ffers a broad range of steel products including a portfolio of high value- added downstream products such as hot rolled, cold rolled, coated steel, rebars, wire rods, tubes and wires.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements as at March 31, 2021 present the /financial position of the Group as well as its interests in associate companies and joint arrangements. The list of entities consolidated is provided in note 52, page 443.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group is Indian Rupee ('\u20b9').\n\nAs on March 31, 2021, Tata Sons Private Limited owns 32.93% of the Ordinary Shares of the Company, and has the ability to in/fluence the Group's operations.\n\nThe /financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 5, 2021.\n\n## 2. Signi/ficant accounting policies\n\nThe  significant  accounting  policies  applied  by  the Group in the preparation of its consolidated /financial statements are listed below. Such accounting policies have  been  applied  consistently  to  all  the  periods presented in these consolidated /financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as 'Ind AS') prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been prepared under the historical cost convention with the\n\nexception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## (c) Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements\n\nIn the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial statements,  the  Group  makes  judgements  in  the application of accounting policies; and estimates and assumptions which a/ffects the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods a/ffected.\n\nKey source of estimation of uncertainty at the date of consolidated  financial  statements,  which  may  cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, is in respect of  impairment,  useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, provisions and contingent liabilities, fair value measurements  of  financial  instruments,  retirement bene/fit obligations and non-current assets classi/fied as held for sale as discussed below:\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe  Group  estimates  the  value  in  use  of  the  cash generating unit (CGU) based on future cash /flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash /flows are developed using internal forecasts. The cash /flows are discounted using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Further details of the Group's impairment review and key assumptions are set out in note 3, page 364, note 4, page 368, note 5, page 371 and note 6, page 372.\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  at  the  end  of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in",

The policy has been detailed in note 2(n), page 355.\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. The policy has been detailed in note 2(y), page 361 and its further information are set out in note 12, page 380.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as result of a past event and it is probable that the out/flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimates. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the /financial statements. Further details are set out in note 25, page 404 and note 38(A), page 422.\n\n## Fair value measurements of /financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of /financial assets and /financial liabilities  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  cannot  be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  Discounted  Cash  Flow  Model.  The  inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risks,  credit  risks  and  volatility.  Changes  in assumptions about these factors could a/ffect the reported fair value of /financial instruments. Further details are set out in note 42, page 429.\n\n## Retirement bene/fit obligations and assets\n\nThe Group's retirement bene/fit obligations are subject to a number of assumptions including discount rates, in/flation, salary growth and mortality rate. Signi/ficant assumptions are required when setting these criteria and a change in these assumptions would have a signi/ficant impact on the amount recorded in the Group's balance sheet and the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss. The Group sets these assumptions based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice. Further details on the Group's retirement bene/fit obligations, including key assumptions are set out in note 37, page 411.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe  recognition  of  non-current  assets  (or  disposal groups) as held for sale is dependent upon whether its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Signi/ficant judgement is required to assess whether the sale of the assets (or disposal group) is highly probable.\n\n## Estimation of uncertainties relating to COVID-19\n\nThe Group has assessed the possible impact of COVID-19 on its /financial statements based on the internal and external information available upto the date of approval of the /financial statements and concluded no adjustment is required in these consolidated /financial statements. The Group continues to monitor the future economic conditions.\n\n## (d) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company i.e. its subsidiaries. It also includes the Group's share of pro/fits, net assets and retained post acquisition reserves of joint arrangements and associates that are consolidated using the equity or proportionate method of consolidation, as applicable.\n\nControl is achieved when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to the variable returns of the entity and the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nThe  results  of  subsidiaries,  joint  arrangements  and associates acquired or disposed o/ff during the year are included in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss from the e/ffective date of acquisition or up to the e/ffective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n\nWherever  necessary,  adjustments  are  made  to  the /financial statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by other members of the Group.\n\nIntra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identi/fied separately from the Group's equity.  The  interest  of  non-controlling  shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identi/fiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## NOTES\n\nforming part of the consolidated /financial statements\n\n## 2. Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nvalue of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interests having a de/ficit balance.\n\n## (e) Business combinations\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.\n\nAcquisition  related  costs  are  recognised  in  the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nGoodwill  arising  on  acquisition  is  recognised  as  an asset and measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred in the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable  assets  acquired,  liabilities  assumed  and contingent liabilities recognised. Where the fair value of the identi/fiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after re-assessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\nOnce  control  has  been  achieved,  any  subsequent acquisitions where the Group does not originally hold hundred percent interest in a subsidiary are treated as an acquisition of shares from non-controlling shareholders. The identi/fiable net assets are not subject to further fair value adjustments and the di/fference between the cost of acquisition of the non-controlling interest and the net book value of the additional interest acquired is adjusted in equity.\n\nBusiness combinations arising from transfer of interests in entities that are under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method. The di/fference between any consideration transferred and the aggregate historical carrying values of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (f) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nFor  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units or groups of cash- generating units that are expected to bene/fit from the synergies of the combination. Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit's value may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated /first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit in proportion to the carrying value of each asset in the unit.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of pro/fit or loss on disposal.\n\n## (g) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those enterprises over which the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, but does not have control or joint control.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost from the date signi/ficant in/fluence commences until the date that signi/ficant in/fluence ceases. Subsequent changes in the carrying value re/flect the post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate and impairment charges, if any.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying value of the associate, the carrying value is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest  in  the  associates,  unrealised  losses  are  also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred and where material, the results of associates are modi/fied to con/firm to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## (h) Interest in joint arrangements\n\nA  joint  arrangement  is  a  contractual  arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic  activity  where  the  strategic  financial  and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nWhere Group entity undertakes its activities under joint arrangements as joint operations, the Group's share of jointly controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other parties are recognised in its /financial statements  and  classified  according  to  their  nature. Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in joint operations are accounted for on the accrual basis. Income from the sale or use of the Group's share of the output of joint operations, and its share of joint arrangements expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic bene/fits associated with the transactions will /flow to the Group and their amount can be measured reliably.\n\nJoint arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as joint ventures. The Group reports its interests in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in joint venture is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture. The consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss re/flects the Group's share of the results of operations of the joint venture.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying value of the joint venture, the carrying value is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the joint venture.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture, unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred and where material, the results of joint ventures are modi/fied to conform to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## (i) Property, plant and equipment\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. All other repair and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as incurred. When a replacement occurs,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe carrying value of the replaced part is de-recognised. Where  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment comprises major components having di/fferent useful lives, these components are accounted for as separate items.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes all direct costs and expenditures incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Trial run expenses are capitalised. Borrowing costs incurred during the period of construction is capitalised as part of cost of qualifying asset.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the di/fference between sale proceeds and carrying value of such item, and is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (j) Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\nExpenditures associated with search for speci/fic mineral resources are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets. The following expenditure comprises the cost of exploration and evaluation assets:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining  of  the  rights  to  explore  and  evaluate mineral  reserves  and  resources  including  costs directly related to this acquisition\n- \u00b7 researching and analysing existing exploration data\n- \u00b7 conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling\n- \u00b7 examining  and  testing  extraction  and  treatment methods\n- \u00b7 compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies\n- \u00b7 activities  in  relation  to  evaluating  the  technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.\n\nAdministration and other overhead costs are charged to the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only if directly related to an exploration and evaluation project.\n\nIf  a  project  does  not  prove  viable,  all  irrecoverable exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with the project net of any related impairment allowances is written o/ff to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nThe Group measures its exploration and evaluation assets at cost and classi/fies as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets according to the nature of the assets acquired and applies the classi/fication consistently. To the extent that a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible asset, the amount re/flecting that consumption is capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible asset.\n\nAs the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All exploration and evaluation assets are monitored for indications of impairment. An exploration and evaluation asset is no longer classi/fied as such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable and the development of the  deposit  is  sanctioned  by  the  management.  The carrying value of such exploration and evaluation asset is reclassi/fied to mining assets.\n\n## (k) Development expenditure for mineral reserves\n\nDevelopment is the establishment of access to mineral reserves  and  other  preparations  for  commercial production.  Development  activities  often  continue during production and include:\n\n- \u00b7 sinking shafts and underground drifts (often called mine development)\n- \u00b7 making permanent excavations\n- \u00b7 developing passageways and rooms or galleries\n- \u00b7 building roads and tunnels and\n- \u00b7 advance removal of overburden and waste rock.\n\nDevelopment  (or  construction)  also  includes  the installation of infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities and housing), machinery, equipment and facilities.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and presented as part of mining assets. No depreciation is charged on the development expenditure before the start of commercial production.\n\n## (l) Provision for restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe Group has liabilities related to restoration of soil and other related works, which are due upon the closure of certain of its mining sites.\n\nSuch liabilities are estimated case-by-case based on available information, taking into account applicable local legal requirements. The estimation is made using existing technology, at current prices, and discounted\n\nusing an appropriate discount rate where the e/ffect of time value of money is material. Future restoration and environmental costs, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and the corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration and environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant and equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are depreciated over the life of the related asset. The e/ffect of time value of money on the restoration and environmental costs liability is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (m)  Intangible assets\n\nPatents, trademarks and software costs are included in the consolidated balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable that associated future economic bene/fits would /flow to the Group. In this case they are measured initially at purchase cost and then amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. All other costs on patents, trademarks and software are expensed in the consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  as  and  when  incurred. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Costs incurred on individual development projects are recognised as intangible assets from the date when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- (i) completion  of  the  development  is  technically feasible.\n- (ii) it is the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n- (iii) ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- (iv)   it is clear that the intangible asset will generate probable future economic bene/fits.\n- (v) adequate technical, /financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available.\n- (vi) it is possible to reliably measure the expenditure attributable  to  the  intangible  asset  during  its development.\n\nRecognition of costs as an asset is ceased when the project is complete and available for its intended use, or if these criteria are no longer applicable.\n\nWhere development activities do not meet the conditions for recognition as an asset, any associated expenditure is treated as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.",

Hence  the  useful  lives for these assets are di/fferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (o) Impairment\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable through continuing use. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is reviewed in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash /flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as and when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount,  so  that  the  increased  carrying  value  does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss immediately.\n\n## (p) Leases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group determines whether an arrangement contains a lease by assessing whether the ful/filment of a transaction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nis dependent on the use of a speci/fic asset and whether the transaction conveys the right to control the use of that asset to the Group in return for payment.\n\n## The Group as lessee\n\nThe Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative  stand-alone  price  of  the  lease  component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception comprises of the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment  losses,  if  any,  and  adjusted  for  any  remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nLease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to re/flect interest on the lease liability, reducing the  carrying  amount  to  reflect  the  lease  payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to re/flect any reassessment or lease modi/fications. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where\n\nthe carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount  of  the  re-measurement  in  the  consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nVariable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are expensed to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which the events or conditions which trigger those payments occur.\n\nIn a sale and lease back transaction, the Group measures right-of-use  asset  arising  from  the  leaseback  as  the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. The gain or loss that the Group recognises in the statement of pro/fit and loss is limited to the proportion of the total gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer.\n\n## The Group as lessor\n\n- (i) Operating lease Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic bene/fits from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (ii) Finance lease When assets are leased out under a  finance  lease,  the  present  value  of  minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the present value of receivable is recognised as unearned /finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which re/flects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## (q) Stripping costs\n\nThe Group separates two di/fferent types of stripping costs that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n\n- \u00b7 developmental stripping costs and\n- \u00b7 production stripping costs\n\nDevelopmental stripping costs which are incurred in order to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves that will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part of mining assets.

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nstripping costs ends when the commercial production of the mineral reserves begins.\n\nA mine can operate several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning and production. In this case, stripping costs are accounted for separately, by reference to the ore extracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning and production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\nThe determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's speci/fic circumstances. The following factors normally point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- \u00b7 mining  of  the  second  and  subsequent  pits  is conducted consecutively with that of the /first pit, rather than concurrently\n- \u00b7 separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset\n- \u00b7 the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 expenditure for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n- \u00b7 the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\nThe relative importance of each factor is considered by the management to determine whether, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.\n\nProduction stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore in the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an additional component of an ore body or deeper levels of material. Production stripping costs are accounted for as inventories to the extent the bene/fit from production stripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\nThe Group recognises a stripping activity asset in the production phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will /flow to the Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and\n- \u00b7 the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nSuch costs are presented within mining assets. After initial recognition, stripping activity assets are carried at cost/deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. The expected useful life of the identi/fied component of the ore body is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping asset.\n\n## (r) Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of  the  instrument.  Financial  assets  and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /financial assets and /financial liabilities (other than /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of /financial asset or /financial liability. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss are immediately recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## E/ffective interest method\n\nThe e/ffective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period. The e/ffective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the /financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.\n\n## (I) Financial assets\n\nCash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances consist of:\n\n- (i) Cash and cash equivalents which include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, are subject to an insigni/ficant risk of change in value and have original maturities of less than one year. These balances with banks are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such an election is made by the Group on an instrument by instrument basis at the time of initial recognition of such equity investments. These investments are held for medium or long-term strategic purpose. The Group has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as fair value through other comprehensive income as the management believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than re/flecting changes in fair value immediately in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are carried at fair value through pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and e/ffective interest rate applicable.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.\n\nImpairment of /financial assets\n\nLoss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised for /financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group recognises life time expected credit losses for all trade receivables that do not constitute a /financing transaction.\n\nFor /financial assets (apart from trade receivables that do not constitute a /financing transaction) whose credit risk has not signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition, loss allowance equal to twelve months expected credit losses is recognised. Loss allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses is recognised if the credit risk of the /financial asset has signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial assets\n\nThe Group de-recognises a /financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\n\nIf the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.\n\nIf the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /financial asset, the Group continues  to  recognise  the  financial  asset  and  also recognises a borrowing for the proceeds received.\n\n## (II) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nClassi/fication as debt or equity\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classi/fied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e/ffective interest rate method where the time value of money is signi/ficant.\n\nInterest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Any di/fference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises /financial liabilities when, and only  when,  the  Group's  obligations  are  discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n\n## Derivative /financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group uses certain derivative /financial instruments to reduce business risks which  arise  from  its  exposure  to  foreign  exchange, base metal prices and interest rate /fluctuations. The instruments are con/fined principally to forward foreign exchange  contracts,  forward  rate  agreements,  cross currency  swaps,  interest  rate  swaps  and  collar.  The instruments are employed as hedges of transactions included in the /financial statements or for highly probable forecast transactions/firm contractual commitments. These derivatives contracts do not generally extend beyond six months, except for certain currency swaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value from the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Group adopts hedge accounting for forward foreign exchange,  interest  rate  and  commodity  contracts wherever possible. At the inception of each hedge, there is a formal, documented designation of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes, inter alia, items such as identi/fication of the hedged item and transaction and nature of the risk being hedged. At inception each hedge is expected to be highly e/ffective in achieving an\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\no/ffset of changes in fair value or cash /flows attributable to the hedged risk. The e/ffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ine/ffective portion of designated hedges is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n\n- \u00b7 for  fair  value  hedges  of  recognised  assets  and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to the risk being hedged, are  recognised  in  the  consolidated  statement  of pro/fit and loss and compensate for the e/ffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives.\n- \u00b7 for cash /flow hedges, the e/ffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ine/ffective portion is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss. If the cash /flow hedge of a /firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item a/ffects the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as and when they arise.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised  in  equity  is  retained  in  equity  until  the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (s) Employee bene/fits\n\n## De/fined contribution plans\n\nContributions  under  defined  contribution  plans  are recognised as an expense for the period in which the employee has rendered the service. Payments made to state managed retirement bene/fit schemes are dealt with as payments to de/fined contribution schemes where the Group's obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a de/fined contribution retirement bene/fit scheme.\n\n## De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nFor de/fined bene/fit retirement schemes, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuation being carried out at each year-end balance sheet date. Re-measurement gains and losses of the net de/fined bene/fit liability/(asset) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) are recognised as an expense within employee costs.\n\nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related restructuring costs or termination bene/fits are recognised, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.\n\n## Compensated absences\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised based on actuarial valuation at the present value of the obligation as on the reporting date.\n\n## (t) Inventories\n\nInventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net realisable  value.  Cost  is  ascertained  on  a  weighted average basis. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the cost of\n\nconversion from their existing state to a /finished condition and for the cost of marketing, selling and distribution.\n\nProvisions are made to cover slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience of utilisation on a  product  category  basis,  which  involves  individual businesses considering their product lines and market conditions.\n\n## (u) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, which is expected to result in an out/flow of resources embodying economic bene/fits which can be reliably estimated. Each provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured on a discounted basis.\n\nConstructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\n- (i) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a su/fficiently speci/fic current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities and\n- (ii) as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge such responsibilities.\n\n## (v) Onerous  contracts\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected bene/fits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.\n\n## (w) Government  grants\n\nGovernment  grants  are  recognised  at  its  fair  value, where  there  is  a  reasonable  assurance  that  such grants  will  be  received  and  compliance  with  the conditions  attached  therewith  have  been  met. Government grants related to expenditure on property, plant and equipment are credited to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss over the useful lives of qualifying assets or other systematic basis representative",

Grants received less amounts credited to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss at the reporting date are included in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income.\n\n## (x)   Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classi/fied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAssets and disposal groups are classi/fied as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is only met when the sale is highly probable and the asset, or disposal group, is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Group must also be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classi/fication.\n\nWhere a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, then it is treated as a discontinued operation. The post-tax pro/fit or loss of the discontinued operation together with the gain or loss recognised on its disposal are disclosed as a single amount in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss, with all prior periods being presented on this basis.\n\n## (y) Income taxes\n\nTax expense for the year comprises of current and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro/fit for the year. Taxable pro/fit di/ffers from net pro/fit as reported in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  the  tax  expected  to  be  payable  or recoverable on di/fferences between the carrying value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof assets and liabilities in the /financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro/fit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences.  In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  on  taxable temporary  differences  arising  on  investments  in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary di/fference and it is probable that the temporary di/fference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su/fficient taxable pro/fits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets re/flects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and they are in the same taxable entity, or a Group of taxable entities where the tax losses of one entity are used to o/ffset the taxable pro/fits of another and there are legally enforceable rights to set o/ff current tax assets and current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic bene/fits in the form of availability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

MAT is recognised as deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.\n\n## (z) Revenue\n\nThe Group manufactures and sells a range of steel and other products.\n\n## Sale of products\n\nRevenue  from  sale  of  products  is  recognised  when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped or delivered to the speci/fic location as the case may be, the risk of loss has been transferred, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satis/fied. Sale of products include related ancillary services, if any.\n\nGoods are often sold with volume discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price speci/fied in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the most likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal will not occur. A liability is recognised for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of /financing is deemed present as the sales are generally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which is consistent with market practice. Any obligation to provide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\nThe Group does not adjust the transaction prices for any time value of money in case of contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer does not exceed one year.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nRevenue from sale of power is recognised when the services are provided to the customer based on approved\n\ntariff  rates  established  by  the  respective  regulatory authorities. The Group doesn't recognise revenue and an asset for cost incurred in the past that will be recovered.\n\n## (aa)  Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of the Group are presented in Indian Rupee ('\u20b9'), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements, transactions  in  currencies  other  than  the  entity's functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.\n\nExchange di/fferences arising upto March 31, 2020 on translation of long term foreign currency monetary items  recognised  in  the  consolidated  financial statements before the beginning of the /first Ind AS /financial reporting period in respect of which the Group has elected to recognise such exchange di/fferences in equity or as part of cost of assets as allowed under Ind As 101-'First-time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards'  are  recognised  directly  in  equity  or added/deducted  to/from  the  cost  of  assets  as  the case may be. Such exchange di/fferences recognised in equity or as part of cost of assets is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss on a systematic basis.\n\nExchange differences arising on the retranslation or settlement of other monetary items are included in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated /financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are expressed in '\u20b9' using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange di/fferences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. On the disposal of a foreign",

Amendment also requires disclosure of the amount recognised in statement of pro/fit and loss to re/flect changes in lease payments that arise from such concession. The Group has not recognised any amount as reversal of lease liability in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and Ind AS 107 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' Interest rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe Group has applied the related amendments. The amendments provide relief from the specific hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform.

In respect of CGUs where indicators of impairment were identi/fied, the Group estimated the recoverable amount based on the value in use.\n\nThe outcome of the test as on March 31, 2021 resulted in the Group recognising a net impairment charge of \u20b9 1,920.32 crore (2019-20: \u20b93,024.81 crore) for property, plant and equipment including capital work-in-progress. The impairment charge (net of reversal) is contained within the Indian, European, South-east Asian and overseas mining operations.\n\nWithin the Indian operations, the Group has recognised an impairment reversal of \u20b9 3.84 crore (net of charge of \u20b9 6.07 crore for plant and machinery) (2019-20: \u20b945.97 crore) in respect of expenditure incurred (included within capital work-in-progress) at one of its mining sites. The impairment reversed is included within other expenses in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nDuring the year, within the South East Asian operations, the Group has recognised an impairment charge of \u20b9 4.50 crore. The impairment charge is included within other expenses in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nDuring the year, the Group has recognised an impairment reversal of \u20b9 125.97 crore (2019-20: charge of \u20b9168.54 crore) with respect to capital work-in- progress within other Indian operations. The impairment recognised is included within exceptional items in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.",

Property, plant and equipment (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. I(a), Page 342]\n\nTata Steel Europe (TSE) is exposed to climate risks through the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) which is applicable to all steel plant within Europe. Given that most European steel producers have not been heavily a/ffected by CO 2 compliance costs to date, TSE's best estimate is that the increased costs of future CO 2 compliance will be passed on to end customers through higher steel selling prices. TSE has a stated ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050 and is considering its future strategy on operating processes while continuing to serve its customers. The technology transition and investments will be dependent on national and international policy which is evolving. Further, the Netherlands Government has enacted legislation for a local additional carbon tax (linked to the EU ETS scheme CO 2 allowances and traded prices), but costs under this tax are not expected until FY25 at the earliest and are not included in the annual plan. Management's assessment is that generally these potential carbon-related costs would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through public spending/ subsidies.\n\nConsidering above and consistent with annual test for impairment of goodwill as at March 31, 2021, property, plant and equipment within the Group's European businesses were also tested for impairment at that date where indicators of impairment existed. The outcome of this test indicated that the value in use of the Group's certain CGUs against which property, plant and equipment is included, using a discount rate of 8.10 % p.a. (March 31, 2020: 8.00% p.a.), except in Tata Steel UK Limited where a discount rate of 8.70 % p.a. (2019-20: 8.80% p.a.) was used, was lower than their carrying value. Accordingly, an impairment charge of \u20b9 1,417.98 crore (2019-20: \u20b92,224.61 crore) has been recognised primarily in relation to the Strip Products UK business. Out of the total impairment charge, \u20b9 1,300.78 crore (2019-20: \u20b92,187.79 crore) is included in exceptional items and \u20b9 117.20 crore (2019-20: \u20b936.82 crore) is included within other expenses in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group recognised an impairment charge of \u20b9 627.65 crore (2019-20: \u20b9677.63 crore) in respect of mining operations carried out in Canada. The value in use was computed using cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved /financial budgets which cover a period of 5 years and future projections taking the analysis out to the period over which the Group has right to use the underlying assets discounted using a discount rate of 10.00 % p.a. (March 31, 2020: 10.00% p.a.) The impairment recognised is included within exceptional items in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of the carrying value in respect of Group's CGUs and property, plant and equipment including sensitivity in respect of inability to fully pass on the Netherlands carbon tax through higher selling prices. The management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations would cause the carrying value of property, plant and equipment in any CGU to materially exceed its value in use, other than in respect of the remaining property, plant and equipment at the Strip Products UK business which had a carrying value as at March 31, 2021 of \u20b9 3,654.69 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b92,338.38 crore) and overseas Canadian mining business which had a carrying value as at March 31, 2021 of \u20b9 5,234.71 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b96,448.75 crore). For the mining operations in Canada, the value in use is dependent on improvement in commodity prices and realisation of cost savings in operation. A reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would increase the likelihood of impairment losses in the future.\n\n- (vi) The details of property, plant and equipment pledged against borrowings is presented in note 23, page 399.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Right-of-use assets (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. I(c), Page 342]\n\nLease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of di/fferent terms and conditions. Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublet the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases. These are used to maximise operational /flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. Majority of the extension and termination options held are exercisable based on mutual agreement of the Group and the respective lessor.\n\nWith the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is re/flected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Payments made under such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nVariable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate (such as lease payments based on a percentage of sales) are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and asset.\n\nFor leases recognized under long term arrangements involving use of a dedicated asset, non-lease components are excluded based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. A change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on the measurement of lease liabilities and the related right-of-use assets.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group recognised the following in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss:\n\n- (i) expense in respect of short-term leases and leases of low- value assets \u20b9 28.63 crore (2019-20: \u20b996.31 crore) and \u20b9 11.50 crore (2019-20: \u20b911.45 crore) respectively.\n- (ii) expense in respect of variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities \u20b9 612.68 crore (2019-20: \u20b9508.04 crore).\n- (iii) income in respect of sub leases of right-of-use assets \u20b9 46.83 crore (2019-20: \u20b97.84 crore).\n- (iv) loss on sale and leaseback transaction entered during the year Nil (2019-20: \u20b90.45 crore).\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, total cash out/flow in respect of leases amounted to \u20b9 2,571.07 crore (2019-20: \u20b92,308.40 crore).\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, commitments for leases not yet commenced was \u20b9 266.57 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9396.68 crore).",

This goodwill relates to expected synergies from combining Corus' activities with those of the Group and to assets, which could not be recognised as separately identi/fiable intangible assets. The goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are any indications that the goodwill may be impaired.\n\nThe recoverable amount of Strip Products Mainland Europe CGU has been determined from a value in use calculation. The calculation uses cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved /financial budgets and strategic forecasts which cover a period of three years and future projections taking the analysis out to perpetuity. Key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding expected changes to selling prices, raw material costs, steel demand in European Union, exchange rates, and a discount rate of 8.10 % p.a. (March 31, 2020: 8.00% p.a.). Changes in selling prices, raw material costs, exchange rates and steel demand in European Union are based on expectations of future changes in the steel market based on external market sources. A Nil (March 31, 2020: Nil) growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections beyond the three-year period of the /financial budgets into perpetuity. The pre-tax discount rate is derived from the Tata Steel Europe's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the WACCs of its main European steel competitors. The outcome of the Group's goodwill impairment test as at March 31, 2021 for the Strip Products Mainland Europe CGU resulted in no impairment of goodwill (2019-20: Nil).\n\nThe management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation would cause the carrying value of the CGU to materially exceed its value in use.\n\n- (b) During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Group recognised an impairment charge of \u20b970.00 crore with respect to one of its Indian subsidiaries, representing a single cash generating unit ('CGU'), engaged in the business of generation and supply of power. The recoverable amount of the CGU related to such goodwill was derived from value in use calculations using cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved /financial budgets and future projections for 23 years and a discount rate of 12.10% p.a. The impairment charge is recognised within exceptional items in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Income tax expenses/(bene/fit)\n\nIndian companies are subject to income tax in India on the basis of their standalone /financial statements. Indian companies can claim tax exemptions/deductions under speci/fic sections of the Income-tax Act, 1961 subject to ful/filment of prescribed conditions as may be applicable. The Company and some of its Indian subsidiaries during the year ended March 31, 2020 have opted for the new tax regime under Section 115BAA of the Act, which provides a domestic company with an option to pay tax at a rate of 22% (e/ffective rate of 25.168%). The lower rate shall be applicable subject to certain conditions, including that the total income should be computed without claiming speci/fic deduction or exemptions.\n\nBusiness loss can be carried forward for a maximum period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year to which the loss pertains.\n\nApart from India, major tax jurisdictions for the Group include Singapore, United Kingdom and Netherlands. The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe reconciliation of estimated income tax to income tax expense is as below:\n\n| Pro/fit/(loss) before tax                                                                            | (\u20b9 crore) Year ended   March 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                      | (1,380.44)                              |\n| Income tax expense at tax rates applicable to individual entities                                    | 230.38                                  |\n| (a)  Tax on income at di/fferent rates                                                               | 9.73                                    |\n| (b)  Additional tax bene/fit for capital investment including research and development expenditures  | (17.19)                                 |\n| (c)  Income exempt from tax/items not deductible                                                     | (581.93)                                |\n| (d)  Undistributed earning of subsidiaries, joint ventures and equity accounted investees            | 23.29                                   |\n| (e)  Deferred tax assets not recognised because realisation is not probable                          | 714.45                                  |\n| (f )  Adjustments to taxes in respect of prior periods                                               | (65.26)                                 |\n| (g)   Utilisation/credit of unrecognised tax losses, unabsorbed depreciation and other tax bene/fits | (593.71)                                |\n| (h)  Impact of changes in tax rates (i)                                                              | (2,272.66)                              |\n| Tax expense as reported                                                                              | (2,552.90)                              |",

Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\n[Item No. III and VII, Page 342 and 343]\n\n- (i) As on March 31, 2020, the Group classi/fied the assets and liabilities of its South East Asia businesses held by NatSteel Holdings Pte. Ltd. ('NSH') and Tata Steel (Thailand) Public Company Ltd. ('TSTH') as held for sale. As at March 31, 2021, even though the Group is committed to dispose o/ff these businesses, there are uncertainties surrounding the completion of a sale transaction within immediate next 12 months from the reporting date. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been re-classi/fied from 'Held for Sale' and the results have been re-presented from 'Discontinued Operations' to 'Continuing Operations' along with restatement of the previous periods to conform to such a re-classi/fication. Consequent to the re-classi/fication, 'South East Asian Operations' is presented as a separate segment.\n\nAs on the reporting date the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, intangibles assets held within these businesses were tested for possible impairments, if any. The outcome of the assessment did not result in any further impairment charge as the recoverable amount of these assets are higher than their carrying amount and thus fair value loss recognized earlier for these businesses have been reversed. Accordingly, the Group recognized an impairment reversal of \u20b9 1,230.28 crore during the year ended March 31, 2021, presented within exceptional item in note 35, page 410.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Equity share capital (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. IV(a), Page 343]\n\n- (vi) 1,00,14,395 shares (March 31, 2020: 1,25,61,401 shares) of face value of \u20b910 per share represent the shares underlying GDRs which were issued during 1994 and 2009. Each GDR represents one underlying Ordinary Share.\n- (vii)   The rights, powers and preferences relating to each class of share capital and the quali/fications, limitations and restrictions thereof are contained in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company. The principal rights are as below:\n\n## A. Ordinary Shares of \u20b910 each\n\n- (i) In respect of every Ordinary Share (whether fully paid or partly paid), voting right and dividend shall be in the same proportion as the capital paid up on such Ordinary Share bears to the total paid up Ordinary Capital of the Company.\n- (ii) The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the Shareholders in the ensuing Annual General Meeting, except in case of interim dividend.\n- (iii) In the event of liquidation, the Shareholders of Ordinary Shares are eligible to receive the remaining assets of the Company after distribution of all preferential amounts, in proportion to their shareholding.\n\n## B. 'A' Ordinary Shares of \u20b910 each\n\n- (i) (a) The holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to such rights of voting and/or dividend and such other rights as per the terms of the issue of such shares, provided always that:\n- -  in the case where a resolution is put to vote on a poll, such di/fferential voting entitlement (excluding fractions, if any) will be applicable to holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares.\n- -  in the case where a resolution is put to vote in the meeting and is to be decided on a show of hands, the holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to the same number of votes as available to holders of Ordinary Shares.\n- (b) The holders of Ordinary Shares and the holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall vote as a single class with respect to all matters submitted for voting by shareholders of the Company and shall exercise such votes in proportion to the voting rights attached to such shares including in relation to any scheme under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.\n- (ii) The holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to dividend on each 'A' Ordinary Share which may be equal to or higher than the amount per Ordinary Share declared by the Board for each Ordinary Share, and as may be speci/fied at the time of the issue. Di/fferent series of 'A' Ordinary Shares may carry di/fferent entitlements to dividend to the extent permitted under applicable law and as prescribed under the terms applicable to such issue.\n\n## C. Preference Shares\n\nThe Company has two classes of preference shares i.e. Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares (CRPS) of \u20b9100 per share and Cumulative Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) of \u20b9100 per share.\n\n- (i) Such shares shall confer on the holders thereof, the right to a /fixed preferential dividend from the date of allotment, at a rate as may be determined by the Board at the time of the issue, on the capital for the time being paid up or credited as paid up thereon.\n- (ii) Such shares shall rank for capital and dividend (including all dividend undeclared upto the commencement of winding up) and for repayment of capital in a winding up, pari passu inter se and in priority to the Ordinary Shares of the Company, but shall not confer any further or other right to participate either in pro/fits or assets. However, in case of CCPS, such preferential rights shall automatically cease on conversion of these shares into Ordinary Shares.\n- (iii) The holders of such shares shall have the right to receive all notices of general meetings of the Company but shall not confer on the holders thereof the right to vote at any meetings of the Company save to the extent and in the manner provided in the Companies Act, 1956, or any re-enactment thereof.\n- (iv) CCPS shall be converted into Ordinary Shares as per the terms, determined by the Board at the time of issue; as and when converted, such Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu with the then existing Ordinary Shares of the Company in all respects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee bene/fits\n\n## A. De/fined contribution plans\n\nThe Group participates in a number of de/fined contribution plans  on  behalf  of  relevant  personnel.  Any  expense recognised in relation to these schemes represents the value of contributions payable during the period by the Group at rates speci/fied by the rules of those plans. The only amounts included in the consolidated balance sheet are those relating to the prior months contributions that were not due to be paid until after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe major de/fined contribution plans operated by the Group are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nThe  Company  and  its  Indian  subsidiaries  provide provident fund bene/fits for eligible employees as per applicable regulations wherein both employees and the Company/Indian subsidiaries make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the eligible employees' salary. Contributions under such schemes are made either to a provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Company/Indian subsidiaries to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees or to state managed funds.\n\nBene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to state managed funds and the Company/Indian subsidiaries do not have a future obligation to make good short fall if any, are treated as a de/fined contribution plan.\n\n## (b) Superannuation fund\n\nThe Company and some of its Indian subsidiaries have a superannuation plan for the bene/fit of its employees. Employees who are members of the superannuation plan are entitled to bene/fits depending on the years of service and salary drawn.\n\nSeparate irrevocable trusts are generally maintained for employees covered and entitled to bene/fits. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries contribute up to 15% of the eligible employees' salary or \u20b91,50,000, whichever is lower, to the trust every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries does not have any further obligations beyond this contribution.\n\nThe  contributions  recognised  as  an  expense  in  the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss during the year on account of the above de/fined contribution plans amounted to \u20b9 1,553.37 crore (2019-20: \u20b91,419.38 crore).\n\n## B. De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans operated by the Group are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nProvident fund bene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to an irrevocable trust set up by the Company/Indian subsidiaries to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees are treated as a de/fined bene/fit plan as the Company/Indian subsidiaries are obligated to provide the members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund.  A  part  of  the  Company's/Indian  subsidiaries' contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company/ Indian subsidiaries and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss under employee bene/fits expense.\n\nIn accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities of Company and its Indian subsidiaries based on guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, other than the amounts provided during the year in respect of two Indian subsidiaries \u20b919.32 crore, there is no de/ficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount  to  be  credited  to  the  individual  members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.\n\nKey assumptions used for actuarial valuation are as below:\n\n|                                        | Year ended   March 31, 2021   | Year ended   March 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                          | 6.50% - 6.80%                 | 6.20% - 6.70%                 |\n| Guaranteed rate of return              | 8.00% - 8.50%                 | 8.00% - 8.50%                 |\n| Expected rate of return on  investment | 7.50% - 8.00%                 | 8.00% - 8.50%                 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\n## (b) Retiring gratuity\n\nThe Company and its Indian subsidiaries have an obligation towards  gratuity,  a  defined  benefit  retirement  plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lumpsum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of /five years of service. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries make annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts or insurance companies. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries accounts for the liability for gratuity bene/fits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.\n\n## (c) Post-retirement medical bene/fits\n\nUnder this unfunded scheme, employees of the Company and some of its subsidiaries receive medical bene/fits subject to certain limits on amounts of bene/fits, periods after retirement and types of bene/fits, depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company and its subsidiaries under an early separation scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The Company and such subsidiaries account for the liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (d) Tata Steel Europe's pension plan\n\nTata  Steel  Europe  (TSE),  a  wholly  owned  indirect subsidiary of the Company, operates a number of de/fined benefit  pension  and  post-retirement  schemes.  The bene/fits o/ffered by these schemes are largely based on pensionable pay and years of service at retirement. With the exception of certain unfunded arrangements, the assets of these schemes are held in administered funds that are legally separated from TSE. For those pension schemes set up under a trust, the trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the schemes bene/ficiaries in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant pension legislation. The trustees are generally responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund, after consulting with the sponsoring employer.\n\nTSE accounts for all pension and post-retirement de/fined benefit  arrangements  using  Ind  AS  19  \"Employee Bene/fits\", with independent actuaries being used to calculate the costs, assets and liabilities to be recognised in relation to these schemes. The present value of the\n\ndefined  benefit  obligation,  the  current  service  cost and past service costs are calculated by these actuaries using the Projected unit credit method. However, the ongoing funding arrangements of each scheme, in place to meet their long-term pension liabilities, are governed by the individual scheme documentation and national legislation. The accounting and disclosure requirements of Ind AS 19 \"Employee bene/fits\" do not a/ffect these funding arrangements.\n\nThe British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) is the legacy de/fined bene/fit pension scheme in the UK and is closed to future accrual. The current Scheme is the successor to the old BSPS which entered a Pension Protection Fund (PPF) assessment period in March 2018. The Scheme currently has around 71,500 members of which over 80% are pensioners with bene/fits in payment. The BSPS is sponsored by Tata Steel UK Limited (TSUK). Although TSUK has a legal obligation to fund any future de/ficit, a key condition of the new BSPS going forward was that it was su/fficiently well funded to meet the scheme's modi/fied liabilities on a self-su/fficiency basis with a bu/ffer to cover residual risks. With the assets that it holds, the new scheme is therefore well positioned to pay bene/fits securely on a low risk basis without recourse to TSUK. Pension risks relating to the Scheme include economic risks (such as interest rate risk and in/flation risk), demographic risks (for example members living longer than expected), and legal risks (for example changes in legislation that may increase liabilities). TSUK has worked with the Trustee to develop and implement an Integrated Risk Management ('IRM') framework to manage these risks. The framework provides ongoing monitoring of the key investment, funding  and  covenant  risks  facing  the  scheme  and tracks progress against the scheme's journey plan and target. Measures taken by the Trustee to manage risk include the use of asset-liability matching techniques to reduce interest rate risk, and investment in assets that are expected to be correlated to future in/flation in the longer term to mitigate in/flation risk. In particular, the scheme's investment policy has regard for the maturity and nature of the scheme's liabilities and seeks to match a large part of the scheme's liabilities with secure bonds, whilst achieving a higher long term return on a small proportion of equity and other investments. However, the scheme's interest rate risk is hedged on a long term funding basis linked to gilts whereas AA corporate bonds are implicit in the Ind AS 19 'Employee Bene/fits' discount rate and so there is some mismatching risk to the TSE /financial statements should yields on gilts and corporate bonds diverge.",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nThe BSPS Trustee and TSE are currently exploring options to further manage the Scheme's risks with one or more insurers. This might include establishing a framework for partial buy-in transactions and/or longevity swaps over a period of time.\n\nThe  BSPS  holds  an  anti-embarrassment  interest  in TSUK agreed as part of the Regulated Apportionment Arrangement ('RAA') entered into in 2017. The antiembarrassment interest was initially 33.33% at the time of the RAA but has since been diluted to less than 1% due to successive equity issuances by TSUK to its parent company Corus Group Limited. No value has been included in the BSPS's assets at March 31, 2021 (March 31, 2020: Nil) for its interest in TSUK.\n\nAt March 31, 2021 the new scheme had an Ind AS 19 surplus of \u20b9 18,860.16 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b926,067.36 crore). TSE has recognised 100% (March 31, 2020: 100%) of the surplus as it has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus. The new scheme is fully funded on a lowrisk technical provisions ('TP') basis and TSUK is working with the Trustee to explore options to increase security for members and to work towards an ultimate winding up of the scheme in which all bene/fits are fully secured with one or more insurance companies. TSUK is investigating with the BSPS Trustee options to buy-in some or all of the scheme's liabilities with an insurer. TSUK retains the sole power to decide whether to subsequently proceed to wind-up and buy-out liabilities. The Pensions Framework Agreement agreed as part of the RAA stipulates that this can only be achieved if the valuation of the scheme on a \"buyout\" basis is either at or above 103%. The 3% excess above full funding would be applied for restoration of an element of member bene/fits foregone as part of the RAA. As the chance of achieving the required pricing level is currently not probable, no adjustments in respect of restoration has been made to the Ind AS 19 'Employee Bene/fits' valuation of the BSPS at March 31, 2021 with the assumption of pension payouts being retained at 100%. The March 31, 2018 valuation was agreed between TSUK and the BSPS Trustee on April 11, 2019. This was a surplus of \u20b96,008.56 crore on a TP (more prudent) basis equating to a funding ratio of 106.3%. The agreed Schedule of Contributions con/firmed that neither ordinary nor de/ficit recovery contributions are due from TSE.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the scheme's liabilities at March 31, 2021 was 14.5 years (March 31, 2020: 14.5 years). On October 26, 2018 the High Court ruled that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUK pension schemes would be required to equalise guaranteed minimum pensions ('GMP'). The ruling also provided guidance on how this equalisation should be undertaken. Following this ruling, TSE recognised in /financial year 2018-19 an increase of \u20b9458.10 crore to the BSPS liabilities in respect of the estimated impact of this equalisation with the related charge recognised in other comprehensive income. This reserve has been retained at the same value in the March 31, 2021 Ind AS 19 position.\n\n## (e) Other de/fined bene/fits\n\nOther  benefits  provided  under  unfunded  schemes include pension payable to directors on their retirement, farewell gifts, post-retirement lumpsum benefit and reimbursement of packing and transportation charges to the employees based on their last drawn salary. The de/fined bene/fit plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks as below:\n\n- (i) Investment  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government/high quality bond yields. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan de/ficit.\n- (ii) Interest  risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of plan's debt investments.\n- (iii) Salary  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (iv) Longevity  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (v) Inflation  risk: Some  of  the  Group's  Pension obligations  are  linked  to  inflation,  and  higher in/flation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of in/flationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme in/flation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contingencies\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Group assesses such claims and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an on-going basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever necessary. The Group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its consolidated /financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Group provides disclosure in the consolidated /financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.\n\nThe following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. The Group believes that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse e/ffect on the Group's /financial condition, results of operations or cash /flows.\n\nIt is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timings of the cash out/flows, if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings. The Group does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the same.\n\n## Litigations\n\nThe Group is involved in legal proceedings, both as plainti/ff and as defendant. There are claims which the Group does not believe to be of a material nature, other than those described below.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe Group has ongoing disputes with income tax authorities relating to tax treatment of certain items. These mainly include disallowance of expenses, tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by the Group as deductions and the computation of, or eligibility of the Group's use of certain tax incentives or allowances.\n\nMost of these disputes and/or disallowances, being repetitive in nature, have been raised by the income tax authorities consistently in most of the years.\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, there are matters and/or disputes pending in appeal amounting to \u20b9 2,461.62 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b92,364.13 crore) which includes \u20b9 8.38 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b911.62 crore) in respect of equity accounted investees.\n\nThe details of signi/ficant demands are as below:\n\n- (a) Interest expenditure on loans taken by the Company for acquisition of a subsidiary has been disallowed in assessments with tax demand raised for \u20b9 1,551.10 crore (inclusive of interest) (March 31, 2020: \u20b91,551.10 crore).\n- (b) Interest expenditure on 'Hybrid Perpetual Securities' has been disallowed in assessments with tax demand raised for \u20b9 170.54 crore (inclusive of interest) (March 31, 2020: \u20b9170.54 crore)\n\nIn respect of above demands, the Company has deposited an amount of \u20b9 1,250.54 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b91,165.00 crore) as a precondition for obtaining stay. The Company expects to sustain its position on ultimate resolution of the said appeals.\n\n## Customs, Excise Duty and Service tax\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, there were pending litigations for various matters relating to customs, excise duty and service tax involving demands of \u20b9 542.04 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9614.58 crore), which includes \u20b9 37.32 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b920.50 crore) in respect of equity accounted investees.\n\n## Sales tax /VAT\n\nThe total sales tax demands that are being contested by the Group amounted to \u20b9 998.87 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9742.66 crore), which includes \u20b9 76.33 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b979.05 crore) in respect of equity accounted investees.\n\nThe detail of signi/ficant demand is as below:\n\n- (a) The Company stock transfers its goods manufactured at Jamshedpur works plant to its various depots/branches located outside the state of Jharkhand across the country and these goods are then sold to various customers outside the states from depots/branches.

The value of these sales was also disclosed in the periodical returns /filed as per the Jharkhand Vat Act, 2005. The Commercial Tax Department has raised demand of Central Sales tax by levying tax on the di/fferences between value of sales outside the states and value of F-Form submitted for stock transfers. The amount involved for various assessment years beginning 2011-2012 to 2016-2017 as on March 31, 2021 is amounting to \u20b9 188.65 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9127.00 crore).",

The Company has not acknowledged this claim and has instead /filed a claim of \u20b9 141.23 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b9141.23 crore) on the party. The matter is pending before the Calcutta High Court.\n- (b)   The State Government of Odisha introduced 'Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio Economic Development Act, 2004' with e/ffect from February 2005 levying tax on mineral bearing land computed on the basis of value of minerals produced from the mineral bearing land. The Company had /filed a writ petition in the Orissa High Court challenging the validity of the Act.

The State of Odisha /filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court and the case is pending in Supreme Court. The potential liability, as at March 31, 2021 is \u20b9 9,709.73 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b98,732.29 crore).\n- (c) The Company pays royalty on iron ore on the basis of quantity removed from the leased area at the rates based on noti/fication issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the price published by India Bureau of Mines (IBM) on a monthly basis.\n\nDemand  of  \u20b9411.08 crore has been raised by Deputy Director of Mines, Joda, claiming royalty at sized ore rates on despatches of ore /fines. The Company has /filed a revision petition on November 14, 2013 before the Mines Tribunal, Government of India, Ministry of Mines, New Delhi, challenging the legality and validity of the demand and to grant refund of royalty paid in excess by the Company. Mines Tribunal has granted stay on the total demand with directive to Government of Odisha not to take any coercive action for realisation of this demanded amount.\n\nThe Hon'ble High Court of Orissa, in a similar matter held the circulars based on which demands were raised to be valid. The Company has challenged the judgement of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigh Court by a separate petition in the Hon'ble Supreme Court on April 29, 2016.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, the Company has /filed rejoinders to the reply /filed by State of Odisha against the revision petition. The State pressed for rejection of revision applications citing the judgment of the High Court. The Company represented before the authorities and explained that the judgment was passed under a particular set of 'facts & circumstances' which cannot have blanket application on the Company considering the case of the Company is  factually  different.  On  August  7,  2019,  the  Mines Tribunal decided to await the outcome of Special leave petition pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and adjourned the matter.\n\n- Likely demand of royalty on /fines at sized ore rates as on March 31, 2021, is \u20b9 2,207.31 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b91,965.52 crore).\n- (d) Demand notices were originally issued by the Deputy Director of Mines, Odisha amounting to \u20b93,827.29 crore for excess production over the quantity permitted under the mining plan, environment clearance or consent to operate, pertaining to 2000-01 to 2009-10.

Other signi/ficant litigations\n\n- a) Odisha Legislative Assembly issued an amendment to Indian Stamp Act, 1889, on May 9, 2013 and inserted a new provision (Section 3A) in respect of stamp duty payable on grant/ renewal of mining leases. As per the amended provision, stamp duty is levied equal to 15% of the average royalty that would accrue out of the highest annual extraction of minerals under the approved mining plan multiplied by the period of such mining lease. The Company had /filed a writ petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act on July 5, 2013. The Hon'ble High Court, Cuttack passed an order on July 9, 2013 granting interim stay on the operation of the Amendment Act, 2013. Because of the stay, as on date, the Act is not enforceable and any demand received by the Company is not liable to be proceeded with. Meanwhile, the Company received demand notices for the various mines at Odisha totalling to \u20b9 5,579.00 crore (March 31, 2020: \u20b95,579.00 crore). The Company has concluded that it is remote that the claim will sustain on ultimate resolution of the legal case by the court.\n\nIn April 2015, the Company has received an intimation from  Government  of  Odisha,  granting  extension  of validity period for leases under the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 up to March 31, 2030 in respect of eight mines and up to March 31, 2020 for two mines subject to execution of supplementary lease deed. Liability has been provided in the books of accounts as on March 31, 2021 as per the existing provisions of the Stamp Act 1899 and the Company had paid the stamp duty and registration charges  totalling  \u20b9413.72  crore  for  supplementary deed execution in respect of eight mines out of the above mines.\n\n- b) Noamundi Iron Mine of the Company was due for its third renewal with e/ffect from January 1, 2012. The application for renewal was submitted by the company within the stipulated time, but it remained pending consideration with the State and the mining operations were continued in terms of the prevailing law.\n\nBy a judgement of April 2014 in the case of Goa mines, the Supreme Court took a view that second and subsequent renewal of mining lease can be e/ffected once the State considers the application and decides to renew the mining lease by issuing an express order. State of Jharkhand issued renewal order to the Company on December 31, 2014. The State, however, took a view on an interpretation of Goa judgment that the mining carried out after expiry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The said demand has been challenged by the Company before the Jharkhand High Court.\n\nThe mining operations were suspended from August 1, 2014. Upon issuance of an express order, Company paid \u20b9152.00 crore under protest, so that mining can be resumed.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Amendment Ordinance 2015 promulgated on January 12, 2015 provides for extension of such mining leases whose applications for renewal have remained pending with the State(s).

The Company on March 20, 2015 replied that since the lease has been extended by application of law till March 31, 2030, the above demand is not tenable. The Company has paid \u20b950.00 crore under protest on July 27, 2015, because the State had stopped issuance of transit permits.\n\nThe Company /filed another writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand which was heard on September 9, 2015. An interim order was given by the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand on September 17, 2015, wherein the Court has directed the Company to pay the amount of \u20b9371.83 crore in 3 equal instalments, /first instalment by October 15, 2015, second instalment by November 15, 2015 and third instalment by December 15, 2015.\n\nIn view of the interim order of the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand \u20b9124.00 crore was paid on September 28, 2015, \u20b9124.00 crore on November 12, 2015 and \u20b9123.83 crore on December 14, 2015 under protest.\n\nThe case is pending before the Hon'ble High court for disposal. The State issued similar terms and conditions to other mining lessees in the State rendering the mining as illegal. Based on the Company's assessment of the Goa mines judgement read with the Ordinance issued in the year 2015, the Company believes that it is remote that the demand of the State would sustain.",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n- (i) Investments in mutual funds and derivative instruments (other than those designated in a hedging relationship) are mandatorily classi/fied as fair value through pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (b) Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of /financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below:\n\nQuoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This Level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities, that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This Level consists of investments in quoted equity shares and mutual funds.\n\nValuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This Level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). This Level of hierarchy includes the Group's over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.\n\nValuation techniques with signi/ficant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This Level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. This Level includes investment in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.\n\n|                                   | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                   | Level 1     | Level 2     | Level 3     | Total       |\n| Financial assets:                 |             |             |             |             |\n| Investments in mutual funds       | 7,218.89    | -           | -           | 7,218.89    |\n| Investments in equity shares      | 544.13      | -           | 426.25      | 970.38      |\n| Derivative /financial assets      | -           | 661.45      | -           | 661.45      |\n|                                   | 7,763.02    | 661.45      | 426.25      | 8,850.72    |\n| Financial liabilities:            |             |             |             |             |\n| Derivative /financial liabilities | -           | 581.42      | -           | 581.42      |\n|                                   | -           | 581.42      | -           | 581.42      |\n\n|                                     | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   | (\u20b9 crore)   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                     | Level 1     | Level 2     | Level 3     | Total       |\n| Financial assets:                   |             |             |             |             |\n| Investments in mutual funds         | 3,431.87    | -           | -           | 3,431.87    |\n| Investments in equity shares        | 205.02      | -           | 344.17      | 549.19      |\n| Investments in bonds and debentures | -           | 49.74       | -           | 49.74       |\n| Derivative /financial assets        | -           | 1,765.70    | -           | 1,765.70    |\n|                                     | 3,636.89    | 1,815.44    | 344.17      | 5,796.50    |\n| Financial liabilities:              |             |             |             |             |\n| Derivative /financial liabilities   | -           | 857.14      | -           | 857.14      |\n|                                     | -           | 857.14      | -           | 857.14      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (i) Current /financial assets and liabilities are stated at carrying value which is approximately equal to their fair value.\n- (ii) Derivatives are fair valued using market observable rates and published prices together with forecasted cash /flow information where applicable.\n- (iii) Investments carried at fair value are generally based on market price quotations. Investments in equity shares included in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value. Cost of unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range. Fair value of investment in preference shares is estimated by discounting the expected future cash /flows using a discount rate equivalent to the expected rate of return for a similar instrument and maturity as on the reporting date.\n- (iv) Fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price which is categorised as Level 1.  Fair value of borrowings which do not have an active market or are unquoted is estimated by discounting the expected future cash /flows using a discount rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return adjusted for credit spread considered by lenders for instruments of similar maturities which is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n- (v) Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its /financial instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all /financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Group could have realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates.

        "page_content": "## NOTES\n\nforming part of the consolidated /financial statements\n\n## 42.  Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realising fair values or in future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity price /fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future speci/fic market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\n## (a) Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\nThe /fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/ liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective consolidated entities.\n\nConsidering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from /fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate to /fluctuations in US Dollar, Great British Pound, Euro, Singapore Dollar and Thai Baht against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nEntities as per their risk management policy, use foreign exchange  forward  and  other  derivative  instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the respective entities' cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of /financing the Group's capital expenditures.\n\nA 10% appreciation/depreciation of foreign currencies with respect to the functional currency of the entities within the Group would result in a decrease/increase in the Group's net pro/fit and equity before considering tax impacts by approximately \u20b9 1,191.46 crore for the year ended March 31, 2021 (2019-20: \u20b9578.31 crore) and increase/decrease in carrying value of property, plant and equipment (before considering depreciation impact) by Nil as at March 31, 2021 (March 31, 2020: approximately \u20b9109.94 crore).\n\nThe foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by assuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the entities within the Group.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been based on the composition of the Group's /financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other derivative and non-derivative /financial instruments not forming part of debt and which do not present a material exposure. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (b) Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by using the cash /flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Group's cash /flows as well as costs.\n\nThe Group is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Group's interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\nBased  on  the  composition  of  debt  as  at  March  31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 a 100 basis points increase in  interest  rates  would  increase  the  Group's  finance costs  (before  considering  interest  eligible  for capitalization) and thereby reduce net pro/fit and equity before  considering  tax  impacts  by  approximately \u20b9 420.54 crore for the year ended March 31, 2021 (2019-20: \u20b9629.81 crore).\n\nThe risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (c) Market risk - Equity price risk:\n\nEquity  price  risk  is  related  to  the  change  in  market reference price of investments in equity securities held by the Group.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments held by the Group exposes the Group to equity price risks. In general, these investments are not held for trading purposes.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments in equity classi/fied as fair value through other comprehensive income/pro/fit and loss as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 was \u20b9 544.13 crore and \u20b9205.02 crore respectively.",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\nA 10% change in equity prices of such securities held as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 would result in an impact of \u20b9 54.41 crore and \u20b920.50 crore respectively on equity before considering tax impact.\n\n## (ii) Commodity risk\n\nThe Group makes use of commodity futures contracts and options to manage its purchase price risk for certain commodities. Across the Group, forward purchases are also made of zinc, tin and nickel to cover sales contracts with /fixed metal prices.\n\nThere  was  no  significant  market  risk  relating  to  the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss  since  the majority of commodity derivatives are treated as cash /flow hedges with movements being re/flected in equity and the timing and recognition in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss would depend on the point at which the underlying hedged transactions are recognised.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of /financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nEntities within the Group have a policy of dealing only with credit worthy counter parties and obtaining su/fficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of /financial loss from defaults.\n\nFinancial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  credit  risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade receivables,  loans  receivables,  investments  in  debt securities and mutual funds, balances with banks, bank deposits, derivatives and /financial guarantees provided by the Group. None of the /financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.\n\nThe carrying value of /financial assets represents the maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk was \u20b9 20,898.34 crore and \u20b918,661.48 crore as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank deposits, investments in debt securities and mutual funds, loans, derivative assets and other /financial assets net of insurance cover, where applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk relating to trade receivables is presented in note 15, page 385.\n\nThe Group's exposure to customers is diversi/fied and there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to any particular customer as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.\n\nIn respect of /financial guarantees provided by the Group to banks and /financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum amount which the Group would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its /financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain su/fficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.\n\nThe  Group  has  obtained  fund  and  non-fund  based working capital lines from various banks. Furthermore, the entities within the Group have access to undrawn lines of committed and uncommitted borrowing/facilities, funds from debt markets through commercial paper programs, non-convertible debentures and other debt instruments. The Group invests its surplus funds in bank /fixed deposits and mutual funds, which carry no or low mark to market risk. The Company and entities within the Group, wherever applicable, have also invested 15% of the non-convertible debentures (issued by the Company/entities) falling due for repayment in the next 12 months in bank deposits, to meet the regulatory norms of liquidity requirements. The Group also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets with a view of maintaining /financial /flexibility.\n\nThe Group's liquidity position remains strong as at March 31, 2021, comprising of current investments, cash and cash equivalents and other balances with bank, in addition to committed undrawn bank lines.\n\n<!-- image -->",
