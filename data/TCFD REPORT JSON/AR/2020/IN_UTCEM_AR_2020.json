It has altered mindsets, perceptions, and strategies for businesses and beyond. If there is one abiding lesson, it is that sustainable growth and development involves holistic nurturing of human, natural, and financial capital. 2020 is a year that will only gain in significance when viewed through the perspective lens of time.\n\n## The Global Economy\n\nThe world has been /fighting the COVID-19 pandemic for more than a year now, and the struggle has had deleterious economic effects. In 2020, the global economy contracted by 3.3%, the largest contraction on record, at least since World War II. Much of it was concentrated in the /first half of FY21, as several countries enforced strict lockdowns. Economies bounced back albeit at differentiated speeds - in subsequent quarters, on the back of large /fiscal stimulus packages, especially in the developed countries, restocking demand after dilution of lockdowns, and improved con/fidence levels following the start of vaccination programmes. As per the recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the US and China are expected to record a strong recovery in 2021, resulting in a net positive expansion of their economies over the 2019 levels. These two engines of growth are expected to boost demand for exports from other countries. Even the other two large economies, the EU and Japan, are expected to/uni00A0expand.",

        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n\nIn response to the pandemic, central banks resorted to strongly supportive monetary policies in most developed economies, causing interest rates to go down to record lows. At the same time, another consequence of this policy has been a surfeit of liquidity. That has led to a strong rally in prices of many industrial commodities, which has also been supported by the evolving economic recovery, stimulus-related demand expectations and certain supply-side disruptions. This has caused in/flationary pressures on the cost dynamics of several manufacturing/uni00A0industries.\n\nThe latest IMF forecast suggests a strong 6% growth in global GDP in 2021. But the occurrence of second and third waves of COVID in different parts of the world and reports of virus mutations have created downside risks to the outlook of a strong growth rebound. Recovery remains uneven and uncertain, with the extent of /fiscal support and level of vaccination being key differentiators of the short-term economic outlook across countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe longer-term prospects for the Indian economy continue to be robust. Various initiatives, including privatisation of public sector enterprises, monetisation of assets, implementation of National Infrastructure Pipeline, targeted investment incentives through the Production-Linked Incentives Scheme and the new Labour Code, are likely to spur a virtuous cycle of investments and growth in the medium term.\n\n## Indian Economy\n\nThe Indian economy, which was /firmly on the path of recovery in the second half of FY21, was hit by a rather unexpectedly virulent second wave of COVID-19. That caused a severe strain on healthcare facilities in many parts of the country, leading to localised lockdowns and a fall in mobility to levels seen a year ago. This may lead to some reassessment of growth estimates for FY22.\n\nAs a silver lining, disruptions to production and supply chains have been far less severe during the second wave than during the /first wave. Vaccinations are picking up pace, which would support faster normalisation of mobility levels and of related economic activities. Continued accommodative monetary policy of the RBI and the expected increase in capex from the Government are factors that will support growth recovery. In addition, global growth prospects provide us with exports as an additional strong driver of growth.\n\nThe longer-term prospects for the Indian economy continue to be robust. Various initiatives, including privatisation of public sector enterprises, monetisation of assets, implementation of National Infrastructure Pipeline, targeted investment incentives through the Production-Linked Incentives Scheme and the new Labour Code, are likely to spur a virtuous cycle of investments and growth in the medium term.\n\n## Aditya Birla Group in Perspective\n\nLike for many other organisations, the COVID crisis brought out challenges of many forms. Economic impact and business disruptions apart, many members of our extended family - our employees and their near ones, our value chain partners, our neighbourhoods - faced health emergencies. The pandemic also caused deep psychological scars as people had to adjust to new ways of living and working. Notwithstanding these challenges, our employees have displayed the highest possible resilience in coping with personal concerns and yet staying focused on the customers and the business. Our business results convey only a small part of the story of our employee courage, compassion, community spirit and cultural strength.\n\nAs the lockdowns took a /firm grip on people's lives and constraints mounted in the early part of the /financial year, our leadership teams rose to the occasion with robust planning and continuous communication with people at all levels through the organisation. Personally, it was energising for me to engage at scale with employees globally through a series of digital townhalls that instilled con/fidence in employees and\n\nreinforced the power of 'One ABG'. The 'Respond, Recover and Re-imagine' framework underpinned several new initiatives. These included close coordination among HR teams across the Group units to respond to local-level challenges by leveraging the organisational resources and a thrust on disseminating relevant information through all digital channels about the resources lined up to help the extended ABG family deal with the emergencies.\n\nCOVID warriors were trained, and voluntary networks were formed to assist our employees and their families in need. Preferential tie-ups with local hospitals and a central coordination centre with an external party were set up to provide special assistance to our employees through Doctors' network, telemedicine and other COVID-related health assistance. Workplace health, hygiene and COVID-appropriate behaviour remained the focus of our managers at all levels helping the organisation to stay ever vigilant. 'Test, Treat and Trace' was the mantra of protection and well-being followed scrupulously.\n\nApart from focusing on health emergencies, initiatives for mental agility and continuous learning were taken to maintain organisational morale. A learning programme christened as 'Chairman's Invitation Series' was curated to bring the best insights on a changing world from the world's leading thought leaders. There was an increased thrust on online education, recognition, and knowledge sharing sessions.\n\nThese well-rounded initiatives on the people front also helped our business performance to bounce back strongly. The focus on customers and costs remained undiminished through the year. Critical business processes such as new line commissioning, new product launches, new system and technology implementation- all happened seamlessly and presented a unique human story of innovation and fortitude bringing alive the values of commitment and passion. People learnt new skills and new behaviour at work while not being at of/fice or at the workplace as one knows. People engagement, team trust and Group values proved to be the energy and the glue for our performance.\n\nIn the spirit of not letting a crisis go to waste, our HR teams globally collaborated to create a long-term HR Strategy for the Group and individual businesses. This was achieved even while working remotely; 150 of the HR leaders came together digitally over a four-month period to craft a coherent HR strategy to re/flect both Group aspirations and the business needs. Premised on creating an avant garde HR strategy, the work focused on employee experience and business productivity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCOVID warriors were trained, and voluntary networks were formed to assist our employees and their families in need. Preferential tie-ups with local hospitals and a central coordination centre with an external party were set up to provide special assistance to our employees through Doctors' network, telemedicine and other COVIDrelated health assistance.\n\nin a balanced mix with growth, technology, and talent as other critical pillars. This HR strategy is under dissemination to various stakeholders and an annual action agenda is being rolled out at all levels. This has been a signature example of collaboration, thought leadership and determined action - ingredients that usually make up most successful organisations.\n\n## Sustainable Focus\n\nThe experience of the past year reinforces the criticality and importance of sustainable businesses. At Aditya Birla Group, sustainable business model needs to have three pillars responsible stewardship, stakeholder engagement and future proo/fing. We use four dimensions of Business sector, Geography of operation, Value chain and Time horizons to identify issues that are material to the sustainability of our businesses; and then create approaches to balance risks and opportunities for all those material issues. For example, on environment, energy conservation initiatives help us to mitigate risks, while solar energy and climate-resilient products help us to pursue opportunities. Since transparency is fundamental to our approach to Sustainability, most of the ABG companies have consciously begun their journey to 'mainstream' ESG/uni00A0reporting.",

The COVID-induced nationwide lockdown from late March to end-April 2020 was a huge challenge for all manufacturing industries. However, with the central and state governments taking measured steps towards unlocking the economy, some encouraging trends were seen from the latter part of May 2020.\n\nSince then, the industry has been on a volume growth path driven mainly by the government's 'Housing for All by 2022' mission and large infrastructure projects. Government spending on infrastructure projects and affordable housing schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana with enhanced budgetary allocations remain the primary drivers of growth for the cement/uni00A0industry.\n\nDuring FY21, your Company recorded net revenues of US$/uni00A06.0 billion ( ' 44,726 crores) and an EBITDA of US$ 1.66 billion ( ' /uni00A012,302 crores).\n\nYour Company's Board of Directors also approved a fresh capex of ' 5,477 crores towards increasing capacity by 12.8/uni00A0MTPA with a mix of brown/field and green/field expansions. The additional capacity will be created in the fast-growing markets of the east, central, and northern regions of the country. This expansion is in addition to your Company's 6.7 MTPA capacity expansion currently underway in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal. Commercial production from these capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner during FY22 and FY23. This signi/ficant investment in a core infrastructure sector will accelerate the wheels of economic activity and aid the kickstart of the private investment cycle. Our capex ambition is forti/fied both by the strength of UltraTech's balance sheet and our conviction on India's inherent growth potential.\n\nUpon completion of the latest round of expansion, your Company's capacity will grow to 136.25 MTPA, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world, outside of China.\n\nIn FY21, your Company also set new benchmarks on sustainability. Your Company raised US$ 400 million (~ ' 2,900 crores), by way of issuance of senior unsecured US$/uni00A0denominated notes, in the form of sustainability-linked bonds. UltraTech is the /first company in India and the second in Asia to issue sustainability-linked bonds.\n\nSustainable growth is an integral part of your Company's business ethos. It continuously strives to enhance environmental conservation measures while ensuring that business growth and pro/fitability are concomitant with its contribution to societal well-being.\n\nBeing a signatory to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), your Company has undertaken a climate change risk and opportunities assessment study as per TCFD recommendations. These /findings have been integrated with the long-term business strategy, risk management and business planning.\n\nThe Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi) has validated your Company's GHG reduction targets, which covers the target to lower its CO 2 intensity in cement to 462 kg net CO 2 per ton of cementitious material (net CO 2 /t.cem.) by 2032.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable growth is an integral part of your Company's business ethos. It continuously strives to enhance environmental conservation measures while ensuring that business growth and profitability are concomitant with its contribution to societal well-being.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe year-long response to the pandemic, across the globe, exhibited all that is noble and uplifting in the human spirit. A spirit that was also in display in your Company's actions and performance during the year.\n\nThrough this pandemic, your Company's people and systems have been battle tested and even better prepared to face any competitive challenge or serious external disruption. It has strengthened the bonds within, opened better vistas of co-operation and convinced our stakeholders that our people deliver - no matter what! That is our best assurance of sustainability and continued collective prosperity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKumar Mangalam Birla\n\nChairman\n\n## Welcome to UltraTech\n\n- 6 Prelude\n- 14 FY21 Highlights\n- 16 Corporate Identity\n- 18 Product Universe\n- 20 Operational Presence\n- 22 Five-year Progress\n\n## Value creation approach\n\n- 26 Value Creation Model\n- 28 Operating Context\n- 30 Business Strategy\n\n## Growth enablers\n\n- 34 Capacity Expansion\n- 36 Cost Leadership\n- 38 Digitisation Drive\n- 42 Extensive Distribution\n\n## ESG commitments\n\n- 46 Environment\n- 50 Social: People\n- 54 Social: Community\n- 58 Governance\n- 59 Board of Directors\n- 60 Corporate information\n\n## Statutory Reports\n\n- 62 Financial Highlights\n- 64 Directors' Report and Management Discussion and Analysis\n- 110 Report on Corporate Governance\n- 131 Shareholder Information\n- 142 Social Report\n- 147 Sustainability and Business Responsibility Report\n\n## Financial Statements\n\n- 161 Independent Auditors' Report\n- 172 Standalone Balance Sheet\n- 173 Standalone Statement of Pro/fit and Loss\n- 176 Standalone Statement of Cash Flow\n- 178 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements\n- 247 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## REIMAGINING A NEW FUTURE\n\n## Empowering people\n\n- PG 8\n\nHelping heal the planet\n\n- PG 10\n\nFuelling prosperity for all\n\n- PG 12\n\n<!-- image -->",

This, in turn, posed the most formidable economic challenge to India and to the world. Bereft of a cure or a vaccine, the public health system in every country faced enormous pressure trying to tackle this allpervasive crisis. The imperative of /flattening the disease curve was entwined with the threat of an imminent recession and job losses, given the restrictions on economic activities enforced by the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. In other words, all containment measures had to consider a trade-off between lives and livelihood.\n\nDespite the severe economic contraction of ~3.3% in 2020, the International Monetary Fund now projects global growth at 6% in 2021, which would moderate to 4.4% in 2022. This is the result of the additional /fiscal support provided by governments in a few large economies, the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of 2021, and the continued adaption\n\nof economic activity to restricted mobility. However, there is uncertainty around this outlook, and much will depend on the path of the pandemic, the effectiveness of policy support in shoring up the vaccine-powered normalisation, and how the /financial conditions of countries eventually shape up.\n\nThe Indian economy witnessed a contraction in H1FY21, followed by a subdued but positive growth in the second half. Higher capital expenditure of the government budgeted for FY22, expectation of a third consecutive normal monsoon and continued normalisation of economic activities following the progress of vaccination augur well for the Indian economy. However, recovery will not be easy, given that the scars of the pandemic run deep and there are uncertainties around the massive second wave of COVID-19 infections, which has registered a sharper spike than the /first wave.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') has taken several steps to maintain easy liquidity conditions and low interest rates, despite higher government borrowings. Such support is expected to continue until the growth recovery becomes more durable. The Government of India has announced measures such as Production-linked Incentive ('PLI') Scheme and monetisation of assets to fund infrastructure development. These, along with the improving cyclical impulses, are helping improve business con/fidence and may stoke a revival of project investment activity in due course.\n\nThe cement industry witnessed de-growth of 10-12% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in H2FY21 the industry began to show signs of early recovery. Lockdown-led demand disruption was the highest in Q1FY21 on account of suspension of production, stalled construction activities and mass exodus of labour. The total lockdown period from late March to end-April 2020, was a huge challenge for all manufacturing industries. But with the central and state governments taking measured steps towards the opening up of the economy, some encouraging trends were seen from the latter part of May 2020, driven largely by a better-than-expected pick-up in cement consumption in the rural markets. Amidst the pandemic, cement consumption witnessed strong growth in the rural, semi-urban and retail markets. In rural India, better labour availability, increase in construction of rural infrastructure and low-cost housing drove cement demand. Demand is also getting in/fluenced by the resumption of construction work related to institutional infrastructure projects such as road and metro rail networks.\n\nAmidst the pandemic, cement consumption witnessed strong growth in the rural, semiurban and retail markets. In rural India, better labour availability, increase in construction of rural infrastructure and low-cost housing drove the cement demand.\n\nCement demand is closely linked to the housing and infrastructure sector. The industry has been on a volume growth path, motivated by the government's 'Housing for All by 2022' mission and large infrastructure projects in the pipeline. Government spending on infrastructure projects and affordable housing schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ('PMAY') with enhanced budgetary allocations will be the primary drivers of growth for the cement industry. Going forward, prospects for the industry in FY22 look bright.\n\nYour Company managed the crisis with a sharp focus on operational ef/ficiencies. In the face of the pandemic, your Company's operations across locations were stopped in line with the government directives. It was in continuous engagement with all stakeholders through various digital platforms. Critical Response Teams were set up across the organisation to plan scenarios and respond to the rapidly changing situation. With the easing of the lockdown, operations gradually stabilised. Your Company recovered the carrying amount of all its inventories, receivables and loans in the ordinary course of business. It was able to service all its debt obligations as per schedule, with its capital and /financial resources remaining entirely protected and its liquidity position adequately covered. As part of its commitment to society, your Company undertook various initiatives during the year to support the country in its /fight against the pandemic.",

All this has resulted in your Company emerging stronger and well prepared in the wake of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nYour Company is closely monitoring the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on its operations while giving primacy to the safety and well-being of its employees and business partners. It has also undertaken a vaccination programme for all its employees and their dependents. With its focus on operational ef/ficiencies and cost control and its continuing concern for its employees and all other stakeholders, your Company is better prepared for any resulting slowdown in the economy.\n\n## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\n## ( ' in crores)\n\n|                                                                            | Standalone   | Standalone   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                            | FY21         | FY20         | FY21           | FY20           |\n| Net Turnover                                                               | 42,677       | 40,033       | 44,239         | 41,781         |\n| Domestic                                                                   | 42,363       | 39,706       | 42,264         | 39,597         |\n| Exports                                                                    | 314          | 327          | 1,975          | 2,183          |\n| Other Income                                                               | 1,300        | 1,343        | 1,221          | 1,300          |\n| Total Expenditure                                                          | 32,224       | 31,997       | 33,158         | 33,183         |\n| Profit before Interest, Depreciation and Tax (PBIDT)                       | 11,754       | 9,379        | 12,302         | 9,898          |\n| Depreciation                                                               | 2,434        | 2,455        | 2,700          | 2,723          |\n| Profit before Interest and Tax (PBIT)                                      | 9,319        | 6,924        | 9,602          | 7,176          |\n| Interest                                                                   | 1,259        | 1,704        | 1,486          | 1,992          |\n| Profit before Impairment and Tax Expenses / share in profit of  Associates | 8,060        | 5,220        | 8,116          | 5,184          |\n| Rates and Taxes                                                            | (164)        | -            | (164)          | -              |\n| Impairment on Advances Given                                               | -/uni00A0    | -            | (97)           | -              |\n| Share in Pro/fit / (Loss) of Associates and Joint Venture (net of tax)     | -            | -            | 2              | (1)            |\n| Profit before Tax Expenses                                                 | 7,896        | 5,220        | 7,858          | 5,183          |\n| Normalised Tax Expenses                                                    | 2,554        | 1,570        | 2,539          | 1,543          |\n| Reversal of Deferred Tax Liability                                         | -            | (1,805)      | -              | (2,112)        |\n| Profit after Tax                                                           | 5,342        | 5,456        | 5,319          | 5,751          |\n| Pro/fit Attributable to Non-controlling Interest                           | -            | -            | (1)            | (4)            |\n| Pro/fit Attributable to Owner of the Parent                                | -            | -            | 5,320          | 5,755          |\n\n## BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\n\n## Production and capacity utilisation (grey cement):\n\n| Particulars                        | FY21   | FY20   | % change   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Installed capacity in India (MTPA) | 111.35 | 111.35 | -          |\n| Production (MMT)                   | 79.70  | 76.57  | 4          |\n| Capacity Utilisation               | 71%    | 69%    | 2          |\n\nMTPA - Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum MMT- Million Metric Tonnes\n\nCement production at 79.70 million tonnes in FY21 was higher by 4% as compared to the previous year.

Furthermore, your Company continuously works towards ef/ficiency improvement. Key initiatives in this regard are:\n\n- -  Commissioning of 7 MW Waste Heat Recovery System ('WHRS') capacity. Your Company will commission another 72 MW of WHRS capacity during FY22, taking the total WHRS capacity to 197 MW. There is plan to further increase this to 302 MW by FY24, which will cater to 26% of the total power requirement.\n- -  Increase solar and wind power capacity from 125/uni00A0MW to >350 MW by the end of FY22 and cater to ~7% of the total power requirement.\n- - Use low-cost fuel viz. industrial waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Continuous improvement in thermal power plant ef/ficiency by reducing auxiliary consumption power.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (ii) Input Material Cost\n\nRaw material cost rose marginally from ' 493/t to ' 504/t due to an increase in additive and /fly ash prices. Increase in diesel prices impacted inbound transportation, resulting in higher raw material cost.\n\nYour Company is continuously working on improving share of blended and premium products in its product mix, leading to an improvement in overall pro/fitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iii)  Freight and Forwarding Expenses\n\nLogistics cost saw marginal increase from ' 1,144/t to ' /uni00A01,158/t, due to increase in diesel cost and lead distance on account of change in market mix. Synergies arising out of the integration of acquired assets aided in lowering the impact.\n\n## Employee Costs\n\nEmployee cost stood at ' 2,182 crores as compared to ' 2,336 crores in the previous year. This is a one-time gain on account of lower expenses towards retirement bene/fits and staff welfare expenses, during the year.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nAt ' 2,434 crores, depreciation for the year is lower by ' /uni00A021/uni00A0crores over the previous year, mainly on account of few assets being fully depreciated.\n\n## Finance Cost\n\nReduction in /finance cost from ' 1,704 crores to ' 1,259 crores was mainly on account of lower borrowings and interest rates during the /financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ratio shows how well a company uses and manages the credit it extends to customers. The ratio is calculated by dividing average trade receivables by average per day turnover.\n- (ii) Inventory Turnover (Days) represents the average number of days a company holds its inventory before selling it. It is calculated by dividing average inventory by average per day turnover.\n- (iii) Interest Coverage Ratio measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payment with its available earnings. It is calculated by dividing PBIT by /finance cost. Your Company's Interest Coverage Ratio improved by 78% over the previous year mainly on account of increase in PBIT and lower interest outgo.\n- (iv) Current Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by current liabilities.\n- (v) Debt Equity Ratio is used to evaluate a company's /financial leverage. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is /financing its operations through debt versus wholly-owned funds. It is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder's equity. Your Company's Debt Equity Ratio (Net) has improved by 45% mainly on account of reduction in Net Debt during the year.\n- (vi) Operating Profit Margin (%) is a pro/fitability or performance ratio used to calculate the percentage of pro/fit a company generates from its operations. It is calculated by dividing the PBIDT (excluding Other Income) by turnover. Your Company's Operating Pro/fit Margin improved by 4% mainly on account of lower costs and higher realisations during the year.\n- (vii) Net Profit Margin (%) is equal to how much net income or pro/fit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It is calculated by dividing the pro/fit for the year by turnover. Your Company's Net Pro/fit Margin improved by 3% mainly on account of lower costs, lower interest outgo and higher realisations during the year.\n- (viii) Return on Net Worth ('RONW') is a measure of pro/fitability of a company expressed in percentage. It is calculated by dividing Net Pro/fit from continuing operations for the year by average Net Worth during the year. The ratio for your Company improved by 2.8% mainly on account of increase in its pro/fitability.\n- (ix) Return on Capital Employed ('ROCE') is a /financial ratio that measures a company's pro/fitability and the ef/ficiency with which its capital is used. In other words, the ratio measures how well a company is generating pro/fits from its capital. It is calculated by dividing pro/fit before interest, exceptional items and tax by average capital employed during the year. This ratio improved by 2.8% for your Company mainly on account of increase in its pro/fitability.\n\n- (x) Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is the portion of a company's pro/fit allocated to each share. It serves as an indicator of a company's pro/fitability. It is calculated by dividing pro/fit for the year by weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. For your Company, the EPS improved on account of increase in Net Pro/fit by 46% over that of the previous year.\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\n\n## ( ' in crores)\n\n| /uni00A0                                                 | FY21     | FY20     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| SOURCES OF CASH                                          | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0 |\n| Cash from Operations                                     | 9,569    | 7,826    |\n| Non-operating Cash Flow                                  | 172      | 259      |\n| Proceeds from Issue of Share Capital                     | 7        | 3        |\n| Decrease in Working Capital                              | 1,982    | 433      |\n| Total                                                    | 11,730   | 8,521    |\n| USES OF CASH                                             | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0 |\n| Net Capital Expenditure                                  | 1,726    | 1,577    |\n| Increase in Investments                                  | 7,433    | 2,633    |\n| Repayment of Borrowings (net)                            | 891      | 2,468    |\n| Repayment of Lease Liability including  Interest thereof | 121      | 112      |\n| (Issue) / Sale of Treasury Shares (net)                  | (7)      | 3        |\n| Interest                                                 | 1,213    | 1,631    |\n| Dividend                                                 | 375      | 380      |\n| Total                                                    | 11,752   | 8,804    |\n| Increase / (Decrease) in Cash & Cash  Equivalents        | (21)     | (283)    |\n\n## Sources of Cash\n\n## Cash from Operations\n\nCash from operations was higher compared to the previous year on account of higher volume, and sales realisation.\n\n## Non-Operating Cash Flow\n\nCash from other activities was lower due to reduced interest income on bank deposits as a result of lower bank deposits.\n\n## Decrease in Working Capital\n\nWorking capital decreased on account of increase in trade payables mainly on account of better credit terms and payment through letter of credit.\n\n## Uses of Cash\n\n## Net Capital Expenditure\n\nYour Company spent ' 1,726 crores on various capex during the year, primarily towards:\n\n- \u00b7  WHRS at various locations\n- \u00b7  Cuttack Grinding Unit\n- \u00b7  Patliputra Grinding Unit\n- \u00b7  Dankuni Grinding Unit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Pali Integrated Unit\n- \u00b7  Bicharpur Coal Block\n- \u00b7  Other normal capex schemes for ef/ficiency improvement and compliance with the changing regulatory framework\n- \u00b7  Plant modernisation and maintenance\n\n## Increase in Investments\n\nYour Company's higher operating cash /flows, resulted in an increase in liquid investment during the year.\n\n## Repayment of Borrowing\n\nIn line with its endeavour to maintain optimal capital structure, your Company repaid high-cost, long-term debt amounting to ' /uni00A05,227 crores and also repaid short-term loans as per due dates.\n\nThe loan repayments have been done through free cash /flows that your Company has generated over the last few quarters, despite the challenging circumstances and severe business interruptions during the /first quarter of the current /fiscal year.

Given the challenging and dynamic environment of your Company's operations, it is committed to proactively managing risk in accomplishing its ambitious goals. Though risks cannot be eliminated, an effective risk management program ensures that risks are reduced, avoided, mitigated or shared. To maintain oversight of your Company's risks, the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee ('RMS Committee') of your Company is mandated to review its Enterprise Risk Management Framework (including plan / process), analyse the risks more deeply and de/fine risk mitigation actions, where necessary.\n\nThrough the Annual Risk Report processes, which are based upon the business environment, operational controls and compliance procedures, your Company aims to assess and prioritise risks, according to their signi/ficance and likelihood. The key risks identi/fied by your Company include economic environment and market demand; in/flation and cost of production; legal and compliance with local laws; /financial and accounting; environment, climate and sustainability; information technology and talent management. Needless to mention, with the challenges presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, pandemic and epidemic-related business risks have also been identi/fied by your Company.",

The risks are analysed considering likelihood and impact as a basis to determine their management.\n\nKey Business Risks identi/fied by your Company:\n\n## Economic Environment and Market Demand\n\nThe demand for construction material is fundamentally driven by the economic growth in the country. Economic slowdown and subdued infrastructural development might lead to a slowdown in construction projects, thus leading to a reduction in cement consumption in the country. The growth in construction activity in the country has been slow over the last few years, impacting the cement consumption. In a scenario where incremental capacity addition exceeds incremental cement demand, the government's push for infrastructure and housing will aid the growth in cement consumption and reduce the overcapacity gap.\n\nThe cement industry in India is an aggregation of small and large companies. In such an environment, the risk of protecting market share is optimal. With the expanding capacities of existing players and the emergence of new entrants, competition is a sustained risk. To mitigate this, continuous endeavours to enhance brand equity through innovative marketing activities, enhancement in the product portfolio and value-add services have been the thrust areas for your Company. The engineering expertise of your Company and its emphasis on quality also minimise its risk against market /fluctuations considerably.\n\n## Inflation and Cost of Production\n\nYour Company faces the risk of in/flation and /fluctuations in the market-driven cost of coal, pet coke, power, and other fuels. Since the cement industry is extremely energy intensive, changes in fuel prices can signi/ficantly impact production cost. To de-risk, your Company has established speci/fic policies of long deliveries and it continuously optimises its fuel mix and energy ef/ficiency, while exploring the use of alternative fuels. The procurement of raw materials at an economical cost or of suitable quality faces a high degree of in/flationary certainty. Your Company mitigates this risk through the establishment of exhaustive policies for procurement of speci/fic raw materials and stores and those amenable to just in time inventories. Limestone being the primary raw material required to produce cement, its continuous and long-term availability is critical, particularly under the dynamic regulatory environment. Your Company currently possesses suf/ficient limestone reserves. Securing additional reserves is critical to address your\n\nCompany's expansion plans. Apart from the preservation and extension of existing reserves, a range of measures including strategic sourcing and changing input mix are adopted by your Company to mitigate the risk of unavailability of limestone.\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nThis comprises the risk if your Company is found to have inadvertently violated laws covering business conduct.\n\nThe country's regulatory framework is ever-evolving and the risk of non-compliance and penalties may increase for your Company, leading to reputational risks. A comprehensive riskbased compliance programme, involving inclusive training and adherence to the Code of Conduct, is thus institutionalised by your Company.\n\nAs a step to mitigate the legal and compliance risk, your Company's management encourages its employees to place their reliance on professional guidance and opinion to discuss the impact of any changes in laws and regulations to ensure total compliance. Periodic and ad-hoc reporting to various internal committees for oversight ensures the effectiveness of such a programme.\n\n## Financial\n\nThis comprises the risk of exposure to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity price /fluctuations. The risk management strategy is to identify the risk exposure, measure and evaluate the /financial impact, and decide on steps to mitigate the risks together with ensuring regular monitoring and reporting.\n\nWith the objective of minimising risks arising from uncertainty and volatility of foreign exchange /fluctuations, an elaborate /financial risk management policy is followed for every transaction undertaken in foreign currency. Your Company's policies to counter such risks are reviewed periodically and constantly aligned with the /financial market practices and regulations.\n\nChanging laws, rules, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance, public disclosure and listing regulations are generating newer and unforeseen risks for companies. The new or changed laws, regulations and standards may lack precedence and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. Thus your Company maintains a high standard of corporate governance and public disclosure to de-risk itself from such dynamic regulatory changes.\n\nValue\n\nCreation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environment\n\nThis comprises risks associated with environmental pollution through the discharge of waste and GHG emissions, which may cause damage to the local ecology and environment. Various initiatives such as sewage treatment plants, recycling of industrial wastewater, bag-house, WHRS and extensive plantation and creation of green belts have been undertaken by your Company to de-risk and protect the environment. Apart from a targeted reduction of CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 by 27% and Scope 2 by 69% by 2032), your Company's risk mitigation strategy includes a change in product mix, energy ef/ficiency, use of alternative fuels and raw materials, WHRS and the increased use of renewable energy. Your Company has also adopted measures such as rainwater harvesting and water recharge that help it overcome challenges related to water availability.\n\n## Climate and Sustainability\n\nSustainability-related climate change risks and opportunities are assessed in line with your Company's risk management policy and have been integrated in its multi-disciplinary Risk Management Framework. Classi/fied as ESG risks, these relate to energy, emissions and water, among other issues. Sectoral review and relevant stakeholder interactions are conducted regularly to develop a list of climate-related risks speci/fic to business and location. Identi/fied risks are then mapped to your Company's risk matrix, which classi/fies the risk according to its impact and likelihood.\n\nPrioritised climate risks are managed through Unit-level committees. Unit and Functional Heads are responsible for identifying risks, developing mitigation plans, updating and reviewing their respective risk registers as per the de/fined process. The consolidated risk report is submitted to the Board-level committee.\n\nScenario based analysis has been conducted for physical as well as transition risks. For physical risks, four scenarios\n\nhave been considered that are linked to Representative Concentration Pathway ('RCP'), which is a GHG concentration trajectory adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ('IPCC'). These include RCP 8.5, RCP 6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios. The pathways describe four possible climate futures on the basis of the volume of GHG emitted in the coming years. All four scenarios have been considered to assess the impact of temperature and precipitation changes in areas where your Company operates. Maximum possible impact has been considered based on projections up to the year 2100.\n\nYour Company has conducted risk assessment exercise to identify climate-related physical and transition risks. Risks are assessed based on the de/fined time horizons over short term (0-3 years), medium term (3-10 years) and long term (10-30 years). The categorisation of risks into physical and transition risks has been done in alignment with TCFD guidelines.\n\nIn case of assessing the impact of transition risks on your Company, scenario analysis has been conducted in alignment with ETP B2DS and IPCC 1.5-degree scenarios. The potential impact of the evolution of climate policies has been considered under both scenarios to assess the resilience of your Company, as well as the potential pathways for decarbonisation so that it can comply with policy mechanisms such as emission trading schemes.\n\nProduct mix is an important variable in managing climaterelated risks. Your Company's products are not only sustainable but also aim to embed sustainability in the entire construction value chain. As many as 73 UltraTech products are certi/fied by GreenPro, the largest Ecolabel in India, which enables end users in the built environment sector to choose sustainable materials for reducing the environmental impact during construction, operation as well as use phase of buildings.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' Report and Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)\n\n## Risk Matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYour Company's approach is highlighted below:\n\n- \u00b7  Enhancing resilience of the building sector: Extreme weather events due to climate change, such as /floods, cyclones and heat waves, may impact the building sector considerably. To mitigate the impact of physical risks on the building sector and society at large, your Company is working with the built environment sector to make buildings more resilient to climate change effects.\n- \u00b7  Your Company is committed to developing products and solutions that reduce carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle of the built environment sector. It offers building products and solutions that lead to optimisation of concrete mixing, improving overall quality and strength of construction, and thus alleviating the impact of physical risks.\n- \u00b7  Your Company has introduced many new products that are designed to make buildings more resilient to dampness.\n\nThis also leads to reduced wear and tear of buildings, increasing longevity, thereby reducing the use of input materials and natural resources during their entire lifetime.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nAcute physical risks: Such risks can potentially impact sales volumes because of disruption of business operations due to interruption in supply chain, rise in logistics costs, power outage, infrastructure damages, manpower shortage, among other aspects.\n\nFew sites of your Company have been exposed to extreme weather events during the last few years, such as /floods and cyclones. In the last three years, sites located in Bhubaneswar, Chennai and Gujarat have been impacted due to extreme weather events. Some of your Company's sites are in geographies that are susceptible to periodic heat waves. However, your Company has implemented several measures to mitigate the impact of physical risks.\n\nGiven its pan-India presence, your Company's sites are highly diversi/fied geographically. If a manufacturing plant faces business disruption or shutdown due to extreme weather events, alternative plants in other locations can serve the market need. Also, its wide logistics network, with warehouses across different parts of the country, enable /flexibility in your Company's operations.\n\nAnnual weather forecasts are considered in supply chain decisions in order to mitigate the risk of delays in sourcing of fuels. Your company has developed strategic partnerships with geographically diverse global vendors for fuels. Regular monitoring of environmental, political and regulatory developments, coupled with /flexible contracts mitigate risks of supply chain disruptions. Inventory norms for fuels are periodically reviewed considering probability and expected impact of likely supply chain disruptions due to above developments. Insurance coverage is in place to protect against damages to business assets or loss of material in warehouses due to extreme weather events.\n\nYour Company has not witnessed any impact of heat waves on its facilities. Nevertheless, it ensures that its employees are protected during peak summer days. It is committed to the WASH Pledge, ensuring adequate availability of safe drinking water to workers. Warehouses are also secured with early morning and late evening operational hours. Disaster management plans, health and safety protocols and adequate communication protocols during extreme weather events ensure safety at sites and minimise the impact on the workforce.\n\nThe /financial impact of physical risks is estimated to be less than 1% of EBITDA. Risk mitigation measures have largely insulated your Company from the impact of extreme weather events.\n\nChronic physical risks: Your Company's vast geographical presence makes it vulnerable to long-term chronic physical risks, such as variation in temperature, precipitation and water scarcity. Potential impact of variation in temperature and precipitation patterns has been assessed through scenario analysis across all four scenarios. Less than a quarter of your Company's cement plants are in sites with extremely high water-stress, combined with a projected long-term decrease in precipitation patterns.\n\nYour Company has implemented several measures which protect the business from the identi/fied chronic risks. Rainwater harvesting systems have also been installed across sites. Harvested rainwater is either used within the sites or recharged into the ground for raising groundwater levels. In addition, your Company's manufacturing sites are Zero Liquid Discharge ('ZLD') and they reuse 100% of treated water within the sites. As a result, nearly 41 out of 58 sites are water positive. The endeavour is to make all sites water positive, enabling your Company to be future-ready for mitigating risks of water stress.\n\nStatutory\n\nReports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transitional risks\n\nEmerging climate-related regulations and carbon pricing mechanisms may /financially impact business in the long run. For example, Emission Trading Scheme ('ETS') and Carbon Tax have been adopted in several geographies around the world. India has committed to reducing its emission intensity by 33-35% by 2030 and is on track to achieve this target /five years in advance (2025). National level commitments may, in the future, cascade down to various industry sectors through the introduction of new climate change policies. The estimated impact of a policy such as ETS on your Company is estimated to be less than 1% of EBITDA, considering commitments already made to decarbonise the business.\n\nYour Company is prepared to mitigate emerging risks pertaining to climate change policy changes through its existing voluntary GHG reduction targets which are SBTi validated, sustainability-linked bonds, its commitment to the GCCA announced '2050 Climate Ambition' and so on.\n\nDelay in adopting low-carbon technologies may lead to increased indirect operating costs. This could be through early retirement of existing assets. Your Company has strategically reduced its dependence on coal-based power generation and is focused on increasing the share of WHRS and renewable energy. Further, initiatives to utilise waste or by-products from other industries, and reducing clinker ratio are driving down emissions intensity. There are also efforts to track the technology and cost trends in emerging areas such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage ('CCUS'), and hydrogen and kiln electri/fication. Also, your Company is committed to aligning with the Paris Agreement Goals and is judiciously monitoring climate change performance at the Board-level, Unit-level and across all relevant functions.\n\n## Information Technology Risks\n\nThis comprises risks related to Information Technology ('IT') systems; data integrity and physical assets.

It is hereby af/firmed that the remuneration paid is as per the Remuneration Policy for Directors, KMP and other Employees.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board\n\nUltraTech Cement Limited ('the Company') an Aditya Birla Group Company adopts / shall adopt this Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy as applicable across Group Companies. This philosophy / policy is detailed below.\n\n## Aditya Birla Group: Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy\n\nAt the Aditya Birla Group, we expect our executive team to foster a culture of growth and entrepreneurial risk-taking. Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards including incentive programs, retirement bene/fit programs, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the longterm success of our stakeholders.\n\n## Our business and organisational model\n\nOur Group is a conglomerate and organised in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences.\n\n## I. Objectives of the Executive Remuneration Program\n\nOur executive remuneration program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success and thereby build value for our shareholders.\n\nOur executive remuneration program is intended to:\n\n- 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to our executives on a holistic basis.\n- 2. Emphasize 'Pay for Performance' by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals.\n\n## II. Executives\n\nOur Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy applies to the following:\n\n- 1. Directors of the Company.\n- 2. Key Managerial Personnel: Chief Executive Of/ficer and equivalent (eg: Deputy Managing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Director), Chief Financial Of/ficer and Company Secretary.\n- 3. Senior Management: as may be decided by the Board of Directors.\n\n## III. Business and Talent Competitors\n\nWe benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are broadly equitable and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. Secondary reference points bring to the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, to appreciate the differences in levels and medium of pay and build in as appropriate for decision making.\n\n## IV. Executive Pay Positioning\n\nWe aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and bene/fits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive payouts at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognise the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning our executives.\n\nWe use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should re/flect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector.\n\n## V. Executive Pay-Mix\n\nOur executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Bene/fits.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Annexure VII (Contd.)\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan:\n\nWe tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant /financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We annually align the /financial and operational metrics with priorities / focus areas for the business.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive:\n\nOur Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as a retention and reward tool.\n\nWe use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicles for our executives as we believe that they best align executive incentives with stockholder interests.\n\nWe grant restricted stock units as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain our executives.\n\n## VI. Performance Goal Setting\n\nWe aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic.\n\nThreshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero level) shall re/flect a base-line level of performance, re/flecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement.\n\nTarget performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance.\n\nMaximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, re/flecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.\n\n## VII. Executive Bene/fits and Perquisites\n\nOur executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee bene/fit plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites\n\nand bene/fits plans commensurate with their roles. These bene/fits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group.\n\n## Other Remuneration Elements\n\nEach of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies.\n\nWe limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax gross-ups for our executives.\n\n## Risk and Compliance\n\nWe aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as, remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives, uncapped pay- outs, unreasonable goals or thresholds, steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds.\n\n## Claw back Clause\n\nIn an incident of restatement of /financial statements, due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made thereafter, we shall recover from our executives, the remuneration received in excess, of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of /financial statements, pertaining to the relevant performance year.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination, Remuneration and Compensation Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy. These services will be established through 'arm's length', agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.\n\n## Annexure VIII\n\n## FORM NO.

We are all collectively struggling, to stem this extremely challenging, and huge calamity. The Government, NGOs, corporates and other key stakeholders, have coalesced to bring COVID relief measures. Even at the cost of being repetitive, let us acknowledge our nation's doctors, medical and paramedical workers. They have and continue, to go beyond the line of duty, to bring succor to the COVID af/flicted. Our population and the size of our country is beyond comparison. Enormous challenges confront us. We can overcome them with a strong sense of solidarity.\n\nI would like to apprise you of the various initiatives we have taken through multiple channels. I will focus on the relief measures executed by us at FICCI Aditya Birla CSR Centre for Excellence. We took cognizance, of the immediate needs that were COVID driven. First and foremost, was the need to address the problem of getting food for the marginalised. We worked with ISKCON, and distributed cooked meals, for lunch and supper in Delhi, Mumbai, and Noida. We reached out to thousands of families. Likewise, we distributed ration kits, in partnership with Goonj, to thousands of families in 11 states. We arranged for 90,000 PPE kits, for frontline health workers in six states. COVID-19 is also a livelihood disaster. More so for the informal sector workers, migrants, small land holding farmers, returnee migrants, villages youths and tribal women. So, with the Nudge Foundation, we launched a 3-year project, themed on 'Creating Resilient Communities' in Odisha, West Bengal, Delhi NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Maharashtra. We have impacted 4 lakh families.\n\nIf you recall we had already shared with you the immediate COVID steps taken after the outbreak of the pandemic. Besides contributing over ' 500 crores, we tried to address related issues at every level. Here is an update:\n\n- \u00b7 Providing 5,000 jumbo cylinders pan India.\n- \u00b7 We have ordered 36 oxygen Pressure Swing Adsorption ('PSA') plants. Of these, six PSA plants have been delivered (Gujarat and eastern UP). These plants produce a liter of oxygen every 60 seconds and are integral to meet the oxygen shortage.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, 2,000 oxygen concentrators, based on the Hub & Spoke model have been instituted in the major state capitals, which then pan out to the smaller towns.\n- \u00b7 1,000 oxygen concentrators supplied by Novelis, distributed to hospitals and communities.\n- \u00b7 In addition, liquid oxygen plants are on stream across the nation at our plant sites. To give you a feel, the Birla Copper Plant in Dahej, has been supplying 25 tonnes of liquid oxygen day in and day out to bridge the gap. Up until now 1,600 tonnes of liquid oxygen has been supplied to the Gujarat Government.\n- \u00b7 We are importing cryogenic tanks.\n- \u00b7 Furthermore, specially designed 40 mobile cardiac ambulances are in service all over the country.\n- \u00b7 More than 500 beds have been earmarked across locations.\n- \u00b7 Proactive engagements with local communities, and other stakeholders, is an ongoing activity.\n- \u00b7 Over a million triple layer surgical masks, have been distributed, along with personal protective equipment.\n- \u00b7 To reinforce COVID prevention messages, such as using mask, social distancing, and sanitising, are unending.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYour Company has contributed signi/ficantly to this humongous effort supporting - oxygen concentrators, PSA plants, liquid oxygen and more. A gist of UltraTech's endeavours apart from the initiatives cited above:\n\n- \u00b7 9 COVID treatment / quarantine centers with equipped 296 beds.\n- \u00b7 628 oxygen cylinders.\n- \u00b7 90 oxygen concentrators.\n- \u00b7 4 oxygen plants at Dhar, Neemuch, Nathdwara and Maihar.\n- \u00b7 3,000 antigen kits.\n- \u00b7 25 fully equipped ambulances in a state of readiness at locations pan India.\n- \u00b7 More than 1,900 awareness camps in 300 villages.\n- \u00b7 2,11,140 masks.\n- \u00b7 41,000 hand sanitisers and hand wash supported to the people.\n- \u00b7 Sprayed 2,800 liters of sodium hypochlorite.\n- \u00b7 4,28,538 food packets to migrants. Additionally, nutrients such as protein powder were given.\n- \u00b7 805 PPE kits to health / frontline workers.\n- \u00b7 3 ventilators (Chandrapur and Siddhi), machine for Blood Cell Counts.\n- \u00b7 Drinking water support. Reverse Osmosis machines at the local hospitals in Dhar.\n- \u00b7 Remdesvir injections.\n\nConsequent to the extended lockdowns, our ground level activities in the 507 villages which service over a million people were constrained. Still good work is done. The spotlight continues to be on education, healthcare, sustainable livelihood, infrastructure development and social reform, in sync with the major United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('SDG') goals.\n\n## Mrs. Rajashree Birla\n\nChairperson,\n\nAditya Birla Centre for Community Initiatives and Rural Development Chairperson, UltraTech Corporate Social Responsibility Board\n\nCompany leverages Government Schemes and the services rendered by the District Authorities, including Collectors and Block Development Of/ficers.

As you may be perhaps aware the Government has set up Navodaya Schools, which admit students from grade 5 upward, and sees them through their entire schooling. The admission is based on the student's performance at a highly competitive examination. Up until now, over 56 children tutored by us have gained admission. Every year of the 50 students per Centre that we coach, 4 children make the grade. Among the others, it stokes the desire to learn more.\n\nOver 3,600 students from 300 schools in the Jodhpur district attend the Utkarsh digital classes.\n\nNearly 9,500 children are enrolled at 250 anganwadis that your Company support.

We de/fine a 'Sustainable Business' as one that can continue to survive and thrive within the growing needs and tightening legal and resource constraints of a 'Sustainable World'. We believe that this means that as we go forward towards the constrained operating environments of 2030 and 2050 that for a continued 'Sustainable World', it can increasingly only contain 'Sustainable Businesses'. To achieve our Group vision, we are innovating away from the traditional sustainability models to one consistent with our vision to build sustainable businesses capable of operating in the next three decades. It is in our own interests to mitigate our own impact in every way we can as this is a direct assistance to creating a sustainable planet. It also prepares us for further mitigation and the need to adapt to a world that is aligned to below 1.5\u00b0 C scenario in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe began our quest with the question, 'If everyone and every business followed the law as written today, is the planet sustainable.' We quickly concluded that around the year 2050, when the Earth's population reaches an estimated 9 billion, climate change, water scarcity, pollution, biodiversity loss and an overload of waste, if left unchecked, would set the planet on a possibly irreversible unsustainable course. It is therefore intuitive that leaders must /find ways to transform industries such that international bodies can codify and governments can legislate over time to reduce the damage and it is imperative that the Group remains ahead of the curve. The /first step of our programme to build sustainable businesses is focused on increasing the capability of our business management systems. Under this programme called 'Responsible Stewardship' we try to move from merely complying with current legal standards to conforming to the international standards set by the global bodies of the International Finance Corporation ('IFC'), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), the International Standards Organisation ('ISO'), Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Services ('OHSAS'), the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI'), the Forestry Stewardship Council and others. To support our\n\nbusinesses in this endeavour, we have created the Group's Sustainable Business Framework of Policies, Technical Standards, and Guidance Notes to give our leaders, managers, employees and contract employees the chance to train, learn, understand, and apply improvement techniques to help our businesses reach higher standards of performance. Our Group Sustainable Business Framework is currently certi/fied to 14 international standards (http://sustainability.adityabirla.com/). So far, we have had much success with respect to reductions in accidents, energy use, water use, and have implemented our /first Biodiversity plans. Our programme to achieve the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Water and Sanitation and Hygiene pledge ('WASH') to ensure that we provide safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in all our operations has resulted in our building over 600 new bathrooms, many for women and differently abled people. Each of these achievements helps reduce and mitigate our impact on the planet and are imperative to building the sustainable business platform for our future. If we are to create fully sustainable business models and systems for the future then 'Responsible Stewardship' by itself is not enough. We need other components to help us with a greater transformation. We need to understand the global mega-trends and their effect on us; geographically, physically, technologically and how the legal system (including regulations and tax) will need to change in order to motivate business to create a sustainable world. Our performance will need to be improved further to meet the changes needed to mitigate and adapt to these External Factors. By talking to our Strategic Stakeholders knowledgeable in these issues, we can scan the horizon to better understand their likely risk to our business. With this information, we enhance our business models, strategies and risk pro/files in order to 'Future Proof' them and our value chains in the medium to long term. Since only 'Sustainable' business can exist in a Sustainable World then a Sustainable Value Chain can also only contain these businesses and so it becomes imperative to map our value chains to look for vulnerabilities. Our goal is to create not only Sustainable Businesses but also Sustainable Value Chains of which we can be a key member. We are helping our leaders to understand which external changes might heavily in/fluence our value chains and business models in the future and what might be expected of our products",

For example, the world will need businesses that are able to mitigate and adapt to climate change, with robust and sustainable supply chains that are also impervious to all external forces that will inevitably begin to affect us in the future. To build sustainable businesses will take time, particularly when we consider some of our very complex value chains but by pushing to be a leader today, we are giving our businesses the best possible chance of achieving long-term success not only for ourselves but also for our value chains and hence for our planet.\n\nIt has always been the Company's endeavour to enhance its environment conservation measures, continue to be pro/fitable and sensitive towards societal wellbeing. The Company has been consistently adopting new technologies that are cleaner and greener. The Company's plants and processes are constantly driven to become more energy ef/ficient, given its quest to become better stewards of natural resources. With its thrust on the use of alternative fuels, the Company has been relentlessly striving to reduce consumption of fossil fuels by substituting these with wastes from other industries. These efforts have resulted in around 3.1% of the Company's fuel requirements being met through the use of alternative fuels. The Company has reinforced its commitments and has taken further strides towards being a more sustainable business. The Company continues to scale up its contribution to the circular economy by utilising 20.29 million tonnes of Alternative Raw Material ('ARM') as part of its production operations. The Company also continues to increase the use of renewable energy as part of its energy mix and has increased the consumption of renewable energy by more than 50% as compared to previous year. It is currently exploring further opportunities for purchase of green power as well as investment in solar and wind generation.\n\nThe Company's carbon dioxide ('CO 2 ') emissions reduction targets, which were committed in July 2020, have been validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative ('SBTi'). The Company has reduced 6% of Scope 1 CO 2 intensity from the base year of 2017 as against the target of 27% reduction by 2032. In energy ef/ficiency, the Company has overachieved the target set by the Government of India for the /first Perform, Achieve and Trade ('PAT') cycle.\n\nAs a founding member of the Global Cement and Concrete Association ('GCCA'), the Company has committed to\n\nthe '2050 Climate Ambition', which is the Company's commitment to drive down the CO 2 footprint of its operations and products, and the collective aspiration to deliver society with carbon neutral concrete by 2050. In FY20, being only the second year of its participation, the Company's score on the S&P's Dow Jones Sustainability Index ('DJSI') was 68, re/flecting a 15% increase over that of the previous year. This disclosure has helped the Company to benchmark itself against the world's best companies in sustainability performance and will be using this to identify opportunities to excel in sustainability performance.\n\nAs part of its continuing initiatives in sustainable growth, the Company has completed Life Cycle Assessment ('LCA') studies for four products. The Company is amongst few companies to conduct the LCA study and has used this as input to identify hotspots over the value chain to reduce environmental impact. The Company has 73 products with GreenPro Certi/fication. This is one of the largest green product portfolio in building material industry in India.\n\nThis year, the Company became the /first company in India and the second company in Asia to issue dollarbased sustainability linked bonds. This year, the Company adopted recommendation of Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosure ('TCFD') and through this recommendation have integrated the /findings into risk management, business planning and strategy. This year the Company continued consideration of carbon US$ 10 per tCO 2 which has enabled it to consider the impact on environment of project / capex in its evaluation and decision making.\n\nThe Company has embarked on digital transformation during the year that has the potential to decouple emissions and resource use from economic growth as well as making its operations safer and more reliable. The Company launched its Sustainability Culture building program - 'Project Jagruti' and under the program sustainability awareness sessions were held across more than 50 manufacturing locations covering over 7,500 employees across our manufacturing vertical.\n\n## Business Responsibility Report\n\n## Section A : General Information about the Company\n\n| 1.

What is the hyperlink for viewing this report? How frequently it is published?\n\nThe Company publishes its Sustainability Report annually. The Report is compliant with the international standard - Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') Standard. The Report is assured by an independent certifying agency and will be available on the following weblink https://www.ultratechcement.com/about-us/ sustainability/sustainability-performance\n\n## Section E: Principle-wise performance\n\nPrinciple 1 - Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with Ethics, Transparency and Accountability\n\n- 1. Does the policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption cover only the Company? Yes/ No. Does it extend to the Group / Joint Ventures / Suppliers / Contractors / NGOs / Others?\n\nThe Company's governance structure guides the organisation keeping in mind the core values of Integrity, Commitment, Passion, Seamlessness and Speed. The Corporate Principles and Code of Conduct cover the Company and its subsidiaries and is applicable to all the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n2.\n\nHow many stakeholder complaints have been received in the past /financial year and what percentage was satisfactorily resolved by the management? If so, provide details thereof, in about 50 words or so.\n\nNo complaints were received during the year.\n\nPrinciple 2 - Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle.\n\n- 1. List up to 3 of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and / or opportunities.\n\nThe Company is strategically focusing on development of products and services that help customers build sustainable structures which are more durable, resource-ef/ficient, cost-effective, and conducive to human lifestyle. It manufactures a range of products that cater to construction needs from foundation to /finish. These include Ordinary Portland Cement ('OPC'), Portland Composite Cement ('PCC'), Portland Pozzolana Cement ('PPC'), Portland Pozzolana Cement Super ('PPCS'), White Cement and White Cement based Products, Ready Mix Concrete including Specialty Concrete, building products like AAC bricks and jointing mortars and a host of others in Retail Formats. It continuously works towards developing products which are greener in nature and less resource intensive.\n\nThe cornerstone of the Company's product stewardship is emphasis on ensuring that the product life-cycle is optimised for ef/ficiency in the use of resources, end-to-end. These efforts are backed with focus on health and safety throughout the manufacturing process. This is ensured through LCA of four types of cement produced - OPC, PCC, PSC, and PPC. The LCA is a methodology for assessment of environmental impact associated at all stages of the product life-cycle, process, or service. Through these, various hotspots are identi/fied in the entire production value chain.\n\nFive cement brands of PPC and PCC have been certi/fied as green products by CII-Green Product and service council. The Company uses waste materials such as /fly ash and slag for manufacturing blended cements (PPC, PCC and PPCS), that helps in the substitution of natural resource such as limestone. These products are also less carbon and energy intensive.\n\nThe Company is the /first commercial Ready-Mix Concrete ('RMC') manufacturer in India to adopt concrete recycling technology and create the /first 'zero discharge' concrete plant. More than 50% of raw material from unused concrete is recycled\n\nfor making fresh concrete and used back in the process. It is also India's /first concrete Company to meet the requirement of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ('LEED') and other green building rating systems as recognised by the Indian Green Building Council ('IGBC').\n\nThe Company's Building Products Division ('BPD') also manufactures number of products which are smarter in nature and help in saving natural resources. Some of these are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Super Stucco - a self-curing no water curing plaster.\n- \u00b7 Power Grout - a self-curing Industrial grout for anchoring / grouting applications.\n- \u00b7 Seal & Dry - water proo/fing systems which helps in water conservations (arresting leakages) in water storage tanks and canals, thus preserving water.\n- \u00b7 Repair mortars and concrete under the name of Basekrete and Microkrete are self- curing (no water curing required) variants, which are used in repair of buildings.\n- \u00b7 C'rete Pro - a liquid system for mortar and concrete modi/fier, which also reduces the water intake into the cement mixes used for preparing mortars, plasters and concrete (10 - 15% water reduction possible).\n\nIn addition to the above, other sustainable products such as Xtralite (AAC blocks) and Readiplast also cater to the Company's customers.\n\nSome of the Company's BPD products are also listed in the Indian Green Building Council Directory of green products under the category of 'energy ef/ficiency' and 'low emitting materials'. White Cement, Wall Care Putty, Textura & Level Plast have been recognised by IGBC for use in Green Building.\n\nCurrently, 73 products have received GreenPro Certi/fication. This is one of the largest green product portfolio in building material industry in India. The Company is focusing on different options to reduce its carbon footprint and other emissions such as replacing traditional fuels with alternative fuels, improving energy ef/ficiency of its products, using clinker additives, implementing Waste Heat Recovery Systems ('WHRS') wherever possible. This will eventually re/flect in lower carbon footprint of its products (OPC, PPC etc).\n\nThe Company has also taken initiatives for educating its stakeholders on the sustainable aspects of its\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproducts. The Technical Services Department educates the users of cement like masons and Individual House Builder ('IHB') on using cement optimally and reducing wastage.\n\nThe Company also informs government agencies about the advantages of using cement for mass housing and roads and the bene/fits of using blended cement. Several seminars have been conducted on concrete roads and white toping to impress on the environmental bene/fits of switching from bituminous roads.\n\n- 2. For each such product, provide the following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):\n- i. Reduction during sourcing / production / distribution achieved since the previous year throughout the value chain?\n\nThe Company has adopted movement towards a circular economy. It has accelerated the adoption of key levers like low clinker products, use of alternative raw materials and fuels, energy ef/ficiency, renewable energy, and WHRS. The Company consumes alternative materials like /flyash, chemical gypsum, slag, red mud, among others which help in conserving natural raw materials used for the cement production. A major initiative was the partnership with Hindalco Industries Limited ('Hindalco') to use red mud, a waste by-product of aluminum manufacturing, in the cement manufacturing process. The Company has found a use for red mud as a replacement for mined minerals such as laterite and lithomarge. It has successfully replaced up to 3% of its clinker raw mix volume thereby reducing its dependence on natural resources. The Company utilises around 1.2 million metric tonnes of red mud annually from Hindalco which will help conserve more than one million tonne of mined natural resources.\n\nAlternative fuels are also used for thermal energy generation which help in the substitution of fossil fuels and allow better management of industrial waste. The use of municipal waste as an alternative fuel and raw material is a big step in the circular economy model. Recycling water, rainwater harvesting and recharging of ground water are standard operating procedures at all manufacturing sites. All the manufacturing locations are zero water discharge.\n\nThe Company has taken aggressive efforts in scaling up green energy in its energy mix. It",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Responsibility Report (Contd.)\n\nhas made signi/ficant investments and tie ups to increase the WHRS and renewable energy over the previous year. There has been a 25% increase in consumption of green energy as compared to the previous year. The Company is committed to increase share of green energy to 34% by FY24.\n\nThe Company has joined initiatives like EP100 where the target is to double its energy productivity (revenue / GJ) by 2035, compared to its 2010 baseline. The Company has also adopted tools like SBTi, Internal Carbon Price ('ICP') to accelerate decarbonisation efforts in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\n- ii. Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year?\n\nCement is one of the key components in building the nation's infrastructure. These critical infrastructure result in bene/fits like distance reduction, congestion reduction and related carbon emission savings. The Company's products deliver carbon emission savings through critical infrastructure projects. For example, the recently commissioned Atal Tunnel is one classic example of critical infrastructure that reduces the environmental impact of the sensitive ecology of the Kashmir valley. The project will bene/fit society by carbon emission savings of ~ 4.02 1 million tons of CO 2 over its life.\n\n- 3. Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (including transportation)? If yes, what percentage of your inputs was sourced sustainably? Also, provide details thereof, in about 50 words or so.\n\nThe Company has commenced a supply-chain sustainability initiative named Project Sahyog, aimed towards achieving environmental and social sustainability across the supply chain through a collaborative and consultative approach. As part of this project, it has developed an Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance ('ESG') framework\n\nwhich shall guide the activities to be undertaken for accomplishing the desired objectives of the project.\n\nProcurement practices and selection criteria by the Company are focused on protection of environment, societal interest and cost-effective procurement seeking resources ef/ficiency, improving the quality of products and services and ultimately optimising cost. The criteria for procurement of equipment are based upon resource ef/ficiency, mainly comprising of but not limited to energy ef/ficiency, fuel ef/ficiency, emission control, waste minimisation etc. The impact of the product / services being procured is considered over its whole life-cycle i.e. from cradle to grave, including due weightage to the disposal aspect also, e.g. e-waste / hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmental friendly manner and no compromise, whatsoever, is made on the same. As regard social aspect, the emphasis is made on ethical issues at the time of vendor evaluation stage itself. The vendor registration form of the Company requires its potential vendors to specify their commitment on the following social aspects:\n\n- 1. Child Labour\n- 2. Forced and Compulsory Labour\n- 3. Health and Society\n- 4. Working Hours\n- 5. Statutory Compliances\n- 6. Human Rights\n- 7. Environment\n- 8. Ethical Conduction\n\nThe Company believes that sustainability in logistics may be achieved by using less polluting and less fuel consuming transport options or selecting vendors who are close to the manufacturing locations. The Company imports fuel in bulk size vessels with full cost advantage of freight. This consumes lesser fuel as compared to smaller size shipment in terms of per ton of material shipped. The Company also maps the Polypropylene ('PP') bags suppliers across the country to minimise distance between supplier plants and Units across the country. The Company also encourages and empoweres the PP bag suppliers to achieve 9001 : 2008 certi/fication.\n\nE-procurement has made the sourcing process more transparent and ef/ficient. An upgraded webbased supplier portal with features like Request For Quote ('RFQ'), submission of offers by the suppliers, generation of comparative charts and the release of orders has been installed. The module is integrated with the Company's SAP system. A reverse auction process of real time competitive bidding for buying and transportation of material, adds to the ef/ficacy of the process.\n\nE-procurement has resulted in more effective communication with vendors and enabled signi/ficant reduction in paper work as well as travel hours.\n\n- 4. Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local and small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work?\n- If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their capacity and capability of local and small vendors?\n\nThe Company has consistently increased the breadth of vendors across goods and services through vendor base enhancement. The objective is to focus on indigenous suppliers, mutual collaboration and partnership for long-term growth.\n\nThe Company has always given preference to local vendors when it comes to sourcing materials. It procures majority of its raw materials and other essentials locally, even when operating from some of the remotest parts of the country.

In this regulatory environment, there is an inherent risk of litigations and claims.\n- \u00b7 Consequently, provisions and contingent liability disclosures may arise from indirect tax proceedings, legal proceedings, including regulatory and other government/ department proceedings, as well as investigations by authorities and commercial claims.\n\nOur audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 We have assessed the Company's accounting policies relating to revenue, discounts, incentives and rebates by comparing with applicable accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 We have assessed the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of Company's internal controls over the provisions, approvals and disbursements of discounts, incentives and rebates.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- We have assessed the Company's computations for accrual of discounts, incentives and rebates, on a sample basis, and compared the accruals made with the approved schemes and underlying documents.\n- \u00b7 We have veri/fied, on a sample basis, the underlying documentation for discounts, incentives and rebates recorded and disbursed during the year.\n- \u00b7 We have compared the historical trend of payments and reversal of discounts, incentives and rebates to provisions made to assess the current year accruals.\n- \u00b7 We have examined the manual journals posted to discounts, rebates and incentives to identify unusual or irregular items.\n\n## Our audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 We have gained an understanding of outstanding litigations against the Company from the Company's in-house legal counsel and other key managerial personnel who have knowledge of these matters.\n- \u00b7 We have read the correspondence between the Company and the various tax/legal authorities and the legal opinions of external legal advisors, where applicable, for signi/ficant matters.\n- \u00b7 We have tested the completeness of the litigations and claims by examining, on a sample basis, the Company's legal expenses and minutes of the board meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent Auditors' Report (Continued)\n\n| The key audit matter                        | The key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                                                       | How the matter was addressed in our audit   | How the matter was addressed in our audit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7                                           | The Company applies signi/ficant judgement in  estimating the likelihood of the future outcome in each  case and in determining the provisions or disclosures  required for each matter.                                   | \u00b7                                           | We have challenged the Company's estimate of the  possible outcome of the disputed cases based on  applicable tax laws and legal precedence by involving  our tax specialists.                                                                                                                              |\n| \u00b7                                           | Resolution of tax and legal proceedings may span over  multiple years due to the highly complex nature and  magnitude of the legal matters involved and may involve  protracted negotiation or litigation.                 | \u00b7                                           | We have assessed the adequacy of the Company's  disclosures in respect of contingent liabilities for tax and  legal matters.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| \u00b7  \u00b7                                        | These estimates could change signi/ficantly over time as  new facts emerge and each legal case progresses.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone /financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the standalone /financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Company's Management and the Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's /financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures in the standalone /financial statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent Auditors' Report (Continued)\n\nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the standalone /financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As required by the Companies (Auditors' Report) Order, 2016 ('the Order') issued by the Central Government in terms of section 143 (11) of the Act, we give in the 'Annexure A' a statement on the matters speci/fied in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the extent applicable.\n- 2.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and ef/ficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of such internal /financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to standalone Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of standalone /financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n## Annexure B to the Independent Auditors' report on the standalone /financial statements of UltraTech Cement Limited for the year ended 31 March 2021. (Continued)\n\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone /financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the standalone /financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to standalone Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nFor B S R & Co.

In determining the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\n- (i) The /financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is the functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\n- (ii) Figures less than ' 50,000 have been shown at actual, wherever statutorily required to be disclosed, all other /figures have been rounded off to the nearest ' in lakhs, unless otherwise stated.\n\nClassi/fication of Assets and Liabilities into Current/Non-Current\n\nThe Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of Current / NonCurrent classi/fication of its Assets and Liabilities.\n\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, an asset is classi/fied as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be realised, or is intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle; or\n\n(ii)\n\n- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (iii) It is expected to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n- (iv) The asset is a cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classi/fied as non-current.\n\nSimilarly, a liability is classi/fied as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; or\n- (ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n- (iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- (iv) The Company does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classi/fication.\n\nAll other liabilities are classi/fied as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classi/fied as non-current only.\n\n## (c) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount/uni00A0or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf signi/ficant parts of an item of PPE have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classi/fied as\n\nPPE when they meet the de/finition of PPE as speci/fied in Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nPPE except freehold land are stated at their cost of acquisition/installation or construction net of accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Expenditure during construction period:\n\nExpenditure/ Income during construction period (including /financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress, and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other non-current Assets'.\n\n## (d) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with inde/finite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Company.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Company uses different useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic bene/fits from those classes of assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.",

The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n- \u00b7 Class of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives / basis of amortisation are as under :\n\n|   No | Nature         | Estimated Useful life / Basis of  amortization                                                                                                     |\n|------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    1 | Jetty Rights   | Over the period of the relevant  agreement such that the  cumulative amortisation is not  less than the cumulative rebate  availed by the Company. |\n|    2 | Mining Rights  | Over the period of the  respective mining agreement                                                                                                |\n|    3 | Mining Reserve | On the basis of mineral  material extraction (proportion  of mineral material extracted  per annum to total estimated  mining reserve)             |\n|    4 | Software       | 3 Years                                                                                                                                            |\n|    5 | Brand Rights   | 18 months                                                                                                                                          |\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic bene/fits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fied as held for sale:\n\nThe Company classi/fies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nsale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly\n\nprobable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets / Disposal groups held for sale' and 'Liabilities included in disposal group held for sale' respectively. Once classi/fied as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (g) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-/financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identi/fied, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identi/fied.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/finite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or\n\ncash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n\nValued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the /finished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition\n\n- \u00b7 Work-in- progress (WIP), /finished goods, stock-in-trade and trial run inventories:\n- Valued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods and WIP includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of Stock-in Trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n- \u00b7 Waste / Scrap:\n- Waste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.",

The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss such that the cumulative expense re/flects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee bene/fits reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on the fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (j) Treasury Shares:\n\nThe Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing the Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing Costs:\n\nGeneral and speci/fic borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset\n\nis ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost incurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange difference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (l) Government Grants:\n\nGovernment grants, related to assets, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with VAT / GST payment, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nThe bene/fit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (m)  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out/flow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash /flows to net present value using\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nan appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci/fic to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss as a /finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to re/flect the current best estimate.\n\nA present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an out/flow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be con/firmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.\n\nClaims against the Company where the possibility of any out/flow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in /financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in /financial statements, where an in/flow of economic bene/fits is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The costs are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re/flect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes\n\nin the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a /finance cost in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (o) Revenue Recognition:\n\n## (i) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that re/flects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n- \u00b7 Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable taking into account the amount of discounts, incentives, volume rebates, and outgoing taxes on sales. Any amounts receivable from the customer are recognised as revenue after the control over the goods sold are transferred to the customer which is generally on dispatch/delivery of goods.\n- \u00b7 Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a signi/ficant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Signi/ficant /financing component - Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a signi/ficant /financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset, the Company assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identi/fied asset;\n- (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic bene/fits from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental\n\nborrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises /fixed payments, including in-substance /fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU, or is recorded in Statement of Pro/fit or Loss if the carrying amount of the ROU has been reduced to zero.\n\nLease Liabilities have been presented in 'Other Financial Liabilities' and the 'ROU' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classi/fied as /financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash /flows are classi/fied as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classi/fied as a\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n/finance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (q) Employee bene/fits:\n\n## De/fined Bene/fit Plans:\n\nFor de/fined bene/fit plans, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a quali/fied independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is re/flected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the pro/fit or loss account when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The Company provides bene/fits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund to its employees which are treated as de/fined bene/fit plans.\n\n## De/fined contribution plans:\n\nContributions to de/fined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such bene/fits. The Company provides bene/fits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as de/fined contribution plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit plan, payable to the employees is the based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the\n\nservices of the Company and is in accordance with the Rules of the Company for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net de/fined bene/fit liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. De/fined bene/fit costs are categorised as follows:\n\nservice cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements); net interest expense or income; and re-measurement\n\nThe present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual de/ficit or surplus in the Company's de/fined bene/fit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic bene/fits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Company are eligible for participation in de/fined contribution plans such superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Company, since Company has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution.\n\n## Provident Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Company are entitled to receive bene/fits in respect of provident fund, which is a de/fined bene/fit plan, for which both the employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the covered employees' salary. The contributions as speci/fied under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Company. The Company is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government speci/fied minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.",

With reference to some employees, liability of other /fixed long-term employee bene/fits is recognised at the present value of the future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Company.\n\nRemeasurement gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (r) Income Taxes:\n\nIncome Tax expenses comprise current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.\n\nCurrent Tax is measured on the basis of estimated taxable income for the current accounting period in accordance with the applicable tax rates and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax asset are recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax losses, carry forward of unused tax credits at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the taxable temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credits are in the\n\nform of unused tax credits that are carried forward by the Company for a speci/fied period of time, hence it is grouped with Deferred Tax Asset. MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the speci/fied period.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting pro/fit nor taxable pro/fit or loss; and\n- b) In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable pro/fit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax bene/fit will be realised.\n\nThe Government of India, on September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, inserted a new Section 115BAA in the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides an option to the Company for paying Income Tax at reduced rates as per the provisions/conditions de/fined in the said section.

However, the Company has estimated and applied the lower income tax rate on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realized or settled in the future period when the Company may be subjected to lower tax rate.\n\n## (s) Earnings Per Share:\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is computed by dividing the net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares and is adjusted for the treasury shares held by the Company to satisfy the exercise of the share options by the employees.\n\n## (t) Foreign Currency transactions:\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in\n\nthe cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences relating to qualifying effective cash /flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations which are recognised in OCI.\n\n## (u) Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures:\n\nThe Company's investment in its subsidiaries, associates and Joint Ventures are carried at cost net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.\n\nOn disposal of the Investment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (v) Financial Instruments:\n\nA Financial Instrument is any contract that gives rise to a /financial asset of one entity and a /financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\n## Initial Recognition:\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /financial assets and /financial liabilities (other than /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss and ancillary costs related to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the /financial assets or /financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets or /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the tenure of the /financial assets or /financial liabilities.\n\n## Classi/fication and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets\n\nThe Company classi/fies /financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, Fair Value",

For /financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Company recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired /financial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nassets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the /financial asset has not increased signi/ficantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on /financial asset increases signi/ficantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Company's trade receivables do not contain signi/ficant /financing component and as per simpli/fied approach, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.\n\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nDerecognition of /financial assets and /financial liabilities:\n\nThe Company derecognises a /financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the /financial asset and also recognises an associated liability for amounts it has to pay.\n\nOn derecognition of a /financial asset, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nThe Company de-recognises /financial liabilities when and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the /financial liability de-recognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Financial Guarantee Contract Liabilities\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities are disclosed in /financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\n## (w)  Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insigni/ficant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n\n## (x) Financial liabilities and equity instruments:\n\n## \u00b7 Classi/fication as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classi/fied as either /financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\n## (y) Derivative /financial instruments:\n\nThe Company enters into derivative /financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company does not hold derivative /financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in pro/fit or loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash/flow hedge.",

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash /flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash /flow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to effective portion as described above are reclassi/fied to Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the Statement of Pro/fit or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or a non-/financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-/financial asset or non-/financial liability.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (aa)  Segment Reporting - Identi/fication of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from\n\nwhich it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete /financial information is available. Based on the management approach as de/fined in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (bb) Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash /flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net pro/fit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or /financing cash /flows. The cash /flows from operating, investing and /financing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## (cc)  Business Combination:\n\nThe Company applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Company to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such goodwill is tested annually for impairment. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Company determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identi/fied all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identi/fied, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Company recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classi/fied either as equity or /financial liability. Amount classi/fied as /financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Note 1(C) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Company's  /financial  statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## (a) Critical judgments in applying accounting policies:\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following\n\njudgments, which have the most signi/ficant effect on the amounts recognised in the standalone /financial statements.\n\n- (i) Classi/fication of Madanpur (North) Coal Company Private Limited as Investment in an Associate:\n\nA Joint Venture Company (JV) 'Madanpur (North) Coal Company Private Limited' was formed by allocatees of Madanpur North Coal Block. As per Ind AS 111, when all the parties, or a group of parties, considered collectively, are able to direct the activities that signi/ficantly affect the returns of the arrangement (i.e. the relevant activities), the parties control the arrangement collectively. Also, joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties. In terms of the JV agreement between the parties, each JV partner has right to nominate one director on the board of JV and major decisions shall be taken by a majority of 75% of the directors present. Since there is no unanimous consent required from the parties, in the judgement of the management the Company does not have joint control over the JV. However, considering the Company's representation in the board and the extent of its ability to exercise the in/fluence over the decision over the relevant activities, the JV has been considered as an associate and accounted under the equity method.\n\n## (b) Key assumptions:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the /financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are re/flected in the assumptions when they occur.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/ component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights, the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable pro/fit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fits and business developments.\n\n## (iii) Income Taxes:\n\nThe Company calculates income tax expense based on reported income and estimated exemptions / deduction likely available to the Company. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to realised or settled in the future when the Company may be subject to lower tax rate based on the future /financials projections.\n\n## (iv) Fair value measurement of /financial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of /financial assets and /financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using\n\nvaluation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (v) De/fined bene/fit plans:\n\nThe cost of the de/fined bene/fit gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical bene/fits and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/fined bene/fit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## (vi) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n## (vii)  Share-based payments:\n\nThe Company measures the cost of equitysettled transactions with employees using BlackScholes model and cash settled transactions with employees using binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 44.\n\n## (viii) Business Combination:\n\n## (a) Fair Valuation of Intangibles:\n\n## Mining Rights:\n\nThe Company has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Company, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## Brand:\n\nThe Company has used relief from royalty method for value analysis of Brand. The method estimates the value as the present value of the after-tax projected revenues cash /flows attributable to the Brand value.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk associated with the Brand Name.\n\n## (b) Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on the size of land parcel.\n\n## Leasehold land:\n\nLeasehold land was valued basis the leasehold interest for the remaining duration of the lease.\n\n## Other Assets:\n\nThe cost approach has been adopted for fair valuing all the assets except vehicles which have been measured at the old book values less depreciation.\n\nThe cost approach includes calculation of replacement cost using price trends applied to historical cost and capitalisation of all the indirect cost, these trends are on the basis of price indices obtained from recognized sources such as the RBI/ OEA or market intelligence. In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## (ix)  Classi/fication of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any signi/ficant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Company's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term re/flects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate speci/fic to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.",

Mandatory transfer to general reserve is not required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n- e) Shares Options Outstanding Reserve: The Company has three share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Company's shares have been granted to certain executives and senior employees. The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.

During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company is continuing to provide for income tax at the old rates, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and various exemptions and deductions available to the Company under the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Company has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these were expected to be realised or settled in the future period when the Company may be subjected to lower tax rate and accordingly reversed net deferred tax liability of ' 1,803.29 Crores during the period ended March 31, 2020.\n\nIn Respect of Deferred taxes, all items are attributable to origination and reversal of temporary differences. Deferred tax bene/fits are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that taxable pro/fits will be available against which, those deductible temporary differences can be realised.\n\n## Note 19: Other Non-Current Liabilities\n\n| Particulars                          |   As at  March 31, 2021 |   '  in Crores As at  March 31, 2020 |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Deferred Income on Government Grants |                    4    |                                 4.17 |\n| Others                               |                    0.93 |                                 1.71 |\n| Total                                |                    4.93 |                                 5.88 |\n\n## Note 20: Current Borrowings\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n| Particulars                                            | As at  March 31, 2021   | As at  March 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Unsecured:                                             |                         |                         |\n| Redeemable preference shares issued                    | 1,000.10                | 1,000.10                |\n| Loans repayable on demand:                             |                         |                         |\n| From Banks -

Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset liability matching strategy.\n\nThere is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully prefund the liability of the Plan. The Company's philosophy is to fund these bene/fits based on its own liquidity and the level of underfunding of the plan.\n\n(xv) The Company's expected contribution during next year is ' Nil.

The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n- Level 2:  The fair value of /financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company speci/fic estimates.

The Company's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of /financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the /financial performance of the Company. The Company uses derivative /financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity /fixed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks.

It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Company on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## (I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive /financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## (A) Foreign Currency Risk:\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash /flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which /fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials and spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps, options and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2021   | March 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Trade receivables                                     |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 2.31             | 1.08             |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.00             | 0.02             |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 5.18             | 2.39             |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.17             | 0.25             |\n| Others                                                | 0.03             | 0.04             |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 54.64            | 14.64            |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 24.92            | 6.92             |\n\n## Foreign currency sensitivity on unhedged exposure:\n\n100 bps increase in foreign exchange rates will have the following impact on pro/fit before tax.\n\n| Particulars   | As at March 31, 2021   | '  in Crores As at March 31, 2020   |\n|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| USD           | 7.98                   | 5.24                                |\n| Others        | -                      | -                                   |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps pro/fit will decrease by an equal amount.\n\n## (B) Interest rate risk:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash /flows of a /financial instrument will /fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint venture in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated /financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of audit reports of the other auditors referred to in the 'Other Matters' paragraph below, is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of matters\n\nWe draw attention to Note 38 (b) (i) of the consolidated /financial statements, which refers to the following matters:\n\n- (a) In terms of Order issued by the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against the Parent including Demerged Cement Division of Century Textiles and Industries Limited ('Demerged Cement Division') dated 31 August 2016, the CCI had imposed penalty of ' 1,449.51 crores for alleged contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 by the Parent (including Demerged Cement Division). The Parent (including Demerged Cement Division) had /filed an appeal against the CCI Order before the Competition Appellate Tribunal ('COMPAT') which was subsequently transferred to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT'). In July 2018, NCLAT completed its hearing on the matter and disallowed the appeal /filed by the Company (including Demerged Cement Division) against the CCI order. Aggrieved by the order of NCLAT, the Company (including Demerged Cement Division) has /filed an appeal before the Honorable Supreme Court, which has granted a stay against the NCLAT order on the condition that the Company (including Demerged Cement Division) deposits 10% of the penalty amounting to ' 144.95 crores which\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent Auditors' Report (Continued)\n\nhas been deposited. Based on a competent legal opinion obtained by the Parent (and Demerged Cement Division), the Parent believes that it has a good case in this matter. Considering the uncertainty relating to the outcome of this matter, no provision has been considered in the books of account. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.\n\n- (b) In terms of Order dated 19 January 2017, the CCI had imposed penalty of ' 68.30 crores pursuant to a reference /filed by the Government of Haryana for alleged contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 in August 2012 by the Parent. The Parent had /filed an appeal before COMPAT and received the stay order dated 10 April 2017. Consequent to reconstitution of Tribunals by the Government, this matter was transferred to the NCLAT for which hearing is pending. Based on a competent legal opinion, the Parent believes that it has a good case in this matter. Considering the uncertainty relating to the outcome of this matter, no provision has been considered in the books of account. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.\n- (c) In case of UltraTech Nathdwara Cement Limited ('UNCL'), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, one of the joint auditors of the Parent have audited the /financial statements and without modifying their opinion on the /financial statements of UNCL for the year ended 31 March 2021 reported that in terms of the Order issued by the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against UNCL dated 31 August 2016, the CCI had imposed penalty of ' 167.32 crores for alleged contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 by UNCL. UNCL had /filed an appeal against the CCI Order before the Competition Appellate Tribunal ('COMPAT') which was subsequently transferred to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT'). In July 2018, NCLAT completed its hearing on the matter and disallowed the appeal /filed by UNCL against the CCI order. Aggrieved by the order of NCLAT, UNCL has /filed an appeal before the Honourable Supreme Court, which has granted a stay against the NCLAT order on the condition that UNCL deposits 10% of the penalty amounting to ' 16.73 crores which has been deposited. Based on the legal opinion obtained by the Parent Company on a similar matter, UNCL believes that it has a good case in this matter. Considering the uncertainty relating to the outcome of this matter, no provision has been considered in the books of account. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.\n- (d) We draw attention to Note 57 (a) (ii) of the consolidated /financial statements which explains that there has been a change of plan relating to UltraTech Nathdwara Cement Limited's ('UNCL') wholly owned subsidiary, Star Super Cement Industries LLC ('SSCILLC') which was previously classi/fied as 'held for sale' (and discontinued operations). During the current year, the Group has re-evaluated the decision to sell SSCILLC and instead decided to make it a part of the continuing operations considering the synergies available with the existing capacity. Consequently, UNCL has sold SSCILLC to UltraTech Cement Middle East Investments Limited ('UCMIL'), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on 23 November 2020. Accordingly, SSCILLC has ceased to be classi/fied as 'held for sale' and the /financial statements of SSCILLC previously presented as discontinued operations have been reclassi/fied as per Ind AS 105 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' and included in income from continuing operations for all periods presented and required adjustments have been made to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of SSCILLC. Accordingly, consolidated /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 as included in the consolidated /financial statements have been restated. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on the internal /financial controls with reference to the consolidated /financial statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls based on our audit.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated /financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint venture to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Independent Auditors' Report (Continued)\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint venture to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements.

We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- (a) The consolidated /financial statements include the audited /financial statements of eighteen subsidiaries, whose /financial statements//financial results/ /financial information re/flect Group's share of total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of ' 8,459.36 Crores as at 31 March 2021, Group's share of total revenue (before consolidation adjustments) of ' 3,149.45 crores and Group's share of total net pro/fit after tax (before consolidation adjustments) of ' 209.39 crores and Group's share of net cash in/flows (before consolidation adjustments) of ' 85.02 crores for the year / period ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated /financial statements, which have been audited by their respective independent auditors.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and ef/ficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint venture company in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements.\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\nAnnexure A to the Independent Auditors' report on the consolidated /financial statements of UltraTech Cement Limited for the year ended 31 March 2021. (Continued)\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated /financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements insofar as it relates to nine subsidiary companies, two associate companies and one joint venture company, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.\n\n## For B S R & Co.

Freehold Land with inde/finite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Company.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Company uses different useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic bene/fits from those classes of assets. he estimated useful life are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.",

Class of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives / basis of amortisation are as under :\n\n|   No. | Nature          | Estimated Useful life / Basis of  amortization                                                                                                     |\n|-------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|     1 | Jetty Rights    | Over the period of the relevant  agreement such that the  cumulative amortisation is not  less than the cumulative rebate  availed by the Company. |\n|     2 | Mining  Rights  | Over the period of the  respective mining agreement                                                                                                |\n|     3 | Mining  Reserve | On the basis of mineral material  extraction (proportion of mineral  material extracted per annum to  total estimated mining reserve)              |\n|     4 | Software        | 3 Years                                                                                                                                            |\n|     5 | Brand  Rights   | 18 Months                                                                                                                                          |\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic bene/fits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Non-Current Assets/ Disposal Group classi/fied as held for sale:\n\nThe Company classi/fies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nmet only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets / Disposal groups held for sale' and 'Liabilities included in disposal group held for sale' respectively. Once classi/fied as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (g) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-/financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identi/fied, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identi/fied.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/finite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable\n\namount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n\nValued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the /finished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\n## \u00b7 Work-in- progress (WIP), /finished goods, stock-in-trade and trial run inventories:\n\nValued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods and WIP includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of Stock-in Trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n\n## \u00b7 Waste / Scrap:\n\nWaste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.",

The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss such that the cumulative expense re/flects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee bene/fits reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (j) Treasury Shares:\n\nThe Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing the Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing Costs:\n\nGeneral and speci/fic borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset\n\nis ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost incurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange difference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (l) Government Grants:\n\nGovernment grants, related to assets, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with VAT / GST payment, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nThe bene/fit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (m)  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out/flow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash /flows to net present value using\n\nValue\n\nCreation\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nan appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci/fic to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss as a /finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to re/flect the current best estimate.\n\nA present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an out/flow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be con/firmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.\n\nClaims against the Company where the possibility of any out/flow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in /financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in /financial statements, where an in/flow of economic bene/fits is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The cost are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re/flect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision\n\ndue to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance, and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a /finance cost in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (o) Revenue Recognition:\n\n- (i) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n- \u00b7 Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that re/flects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n- \u00b7 Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable taking into account the amount of discounts, incentives, volume rebates and outgoing taxes on sales. Any amounts receivable from the customer are recognised as revenue after the control over the goods sold are transferred to the customer which is generally on dispatch / delivery of goods.\n- \u00b7 Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a signi/ficant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Signi/ficant /financing component - Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a signi/ficant /financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset, the Company assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identi/fied asset;\n- (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic bene/fits from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n## As a lessee\n\n## The Company recognizes a right-of-use\n\nasset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises /fixed payments, including in-substance /fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU or is recorded in Statement of Pro/fit or Loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\nLease Liabilities have been presented in 'Financial Liabilities' and the 'ROU' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classi/fied as /financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash /flows are classi/fied as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classi/fied as a /finance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## (q) Employee bene/fits:\n\n## De/fined Bene/fit Plans:\n\nFor de/fined bene/fit plans, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a quali/fied independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is re/flected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the pro/fit or loss account when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The Company provides bene/fits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund to its employees which are treated as de/fined bene/fit plans.\n\n## De/fined contribution plans:\n\nContributions to de/fined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such bene/fits. The Company provides bene/fits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as de\u00fbned contribution plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit plan, payable to the employees is based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Company and is in accordance with the Rules of the Company for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment.\n\nInterest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net de/fined bene/fit liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. De/fined bene/fit costs are categorised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);\n- \u00b7 net interest expense or income; and\n- \u00b7 re-measurement\n\nThe present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual de/ficit or surplus in the Company's de/fined bene/fit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic bene/fits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Company are eligible for participation in de/fined contribution plans such as superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Company, since Company has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution./uni00A0\n\n## Provident Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Company are entitled to receive bene/fits in respect of provident fund, which is a de/fined bene/fit plan, for which both the employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the covered employees' salary. The contributions as speci/fied under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Company. The Company is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government speci/fied minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.",

With reference to some employees, liability of other /fixed long-term employee bene/fits is recognised at the present value of the future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Company.\n\nRemeasurement gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (r) Income Taxes:\n\nIncome Tax expenses comprise current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.\n\nCurrent Tax is measured on the basis of estimated taxable income for the current accounting period in accordance with the applicable tax rates and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax asset are recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax losses, carry forward of unused tax credits at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credits are in the form of unused tax credits that\n\nare carried forward by the Company for a speci/fied period of time, hence it is grouped with Deferred Tax Asset. MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the speci/fied period.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting pro/fit nor taxable pro/fit or loss; and\n- b) In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable pro/fit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax bene/fit will be realised.\n\nThe Government of India, on September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, inserted a new Section 115BAA in the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides an option to the Company for paying Income Tax at reduced rates as per the provisions/conditions de/fined in the said section.

However, the Company has estimated and applied the lower income tax rate on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realized or settled in the future period when the Company may be subjected to lower tax rate.\n\n## (s) Earnings Per Share:\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is computed by dividing the net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares and is adjusted for the treasury shares held by the Company to satisfy the exercise of the share options by the employees.\n\n## (t) Foreign Currency transactions:\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded\n\nas an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences relating to qualifying effective cash /flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations which are recognised in OCI.\n\n## (u) Foreign operations:\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into INR, the functional currency of the Company, at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in equity (as exchange differences on translating the /financial statements of a foreign operation), except to the extent that the exchange differences are allocated to NCI.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, signi/ficant in/fluence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognized in OCI is reclassi/fied to Statement of Pro/fit and Loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is re-allocated to NCI. When the Group disposes of only a part of its interest in an associate or a joint venture while retaining signi/ficant in/fluence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassi/fied to Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (v) Financial Instruments:\n\nA Financial Instrument is any contract that gives rise to a /financial asset of one entity and a /financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\n## Initial Recognition:\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.

Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets or /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the tenure of the /financial assets or /financial liabilities.\n\n## Classi/fication and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets\n\nThe Company classi/fies /financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI') or Fair Value through Pro/fit or Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:\n\n- \u00b7 the entity's business model for managing the /financial assets and\n- \u00b7 the contractual cash /flow characteristics of the /financial asset.\n\n## Amortised Cost:\n\nA /financial asset shall be classi/fied and measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the /financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold /financial assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nIn case of /financial assets classi/fied and measured at amortised cost, any interest income, foreign exchange gains or losses and impairment are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Fair Value through OCI:\n\nA /financial asset shall be classi/fied and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the /financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash /flows and selling /financial assets and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Fair Value through Pro/fit or Loss:\n\nA /financial asset shall be classi/fied and measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI.\n\nAll recognised /financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classi/fication of the /financial assets.\n\nFor /financial assets at FVTPL, net gains or losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Classi/fication and Subsequent Measurement: Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fied as either /financial liabilities at FVTPL or 'other /financial liabilities.\n\n## Financial Liabilities at FVTPL:\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fied as at FVTPL when the /financial liability is held for trading or is a derivative (except for effective hedge) or are designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL.\n\nGains or Losses, including any interest expense on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Other Financial Liabilities:\n\nOther /financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the /financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortised cost on initial recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nInterest expense (based on the effective interest method), foreign exchange gains and losses, and any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Impairment of /financial assets:\n\nExpected credit losses are recognized for all /financial assets subsequent to initial recognition other than /financials assets in FVTPL category. For /financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Company recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired /financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the /financial asset has not increased signi/ficantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on /financial asset increases signi/ficantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Company's trade receivables do not contain signi/ficant /financing component and as per simpli/fied approach, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.\n\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Derecognition of /financial assets and /financial liabilities:\n\nThe Company derecognises a /financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the /financial asset and recognises an associated liability for amounts it has to pay.\n\nOn derecognition of a /financial asset, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nThe Company de-recognises /financial liabilities when and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the /financial liability de-recognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Financial Guarantee Contract Liabilities\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities are disclosed in /financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\n## (w)  Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insigni/ficant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting shortterm cash commitments.\n\n## (x) Financial liabilities and equity instruments:\n\n## \u00b7 Classi/fication as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classi/fied as either /financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\n## (y) Derivative /financial instruments:\n\nThe Company enters into derivative /financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company does not hold derivative /financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are",

The resulting gain or loss is recognised in pro/fit or loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash/flow hedge.\n\n## (z) Hedge accounting:\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk as cash /flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash /flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash /flow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in pro/fit or loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to effective portion as described above are reclassi/fied to Statement of Pro/fit or Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the Statement of Pro/fit or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non/financial asset or a non-/financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-/financial asset or non-/financial liability.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (aa)  Segment Reporting: Identi/fication of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete /financial information is available. Based on the management approach as de/fined in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (bb) Goodwill:\n\nGoodwill arising out of Consolidation of /financial statements of subsidiaries are tested for impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## (cc)  Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash /flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net pro/fit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or /financing cash /flows. The cash /flows from operating, investing and /financing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## (dd) Business Combination:\n\nThe Company applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Company to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such goodwill is tested annually for impairment. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Company determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identi/fied all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identi/fied, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Company recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classi/fied either as equity or /financial liability. Amount classi/fied as /financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (ee)  Discontinued Operations:\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cash/flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and\n\n- -Is a part of single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n- -Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.\n\nClassi/fication as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classi/fied as held for sale, if earlier.\n\nWhen an operation is classi/fied as a discontinued operation, the comparative Statement of Pro/fit and Loss is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.\n\n## Note 1(C) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Company's  /financial  statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## (a) Critical judgments in applying accounting policies:\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most signi/ficant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## (i) Classi/fication of Madanpur (North) Coal Company Private Limited as Investment in an Associate:\n\nA Joint Venture Company (JV) 'Madanpur (North) Coal Company Limited' was formed by allocatees of Madanpur North Coal Block. As per Ind AS 111, when all the parties, or a group of parties, considered collectively, are able to direct the activities that signi/ficantly affect the returns of the arrangement (i.e. the relevant activities), the parties control the arrangement collectively. Also, joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties. In terms of the JV agreement between the parties, each JV partner has right",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\nto nominate one director on the board of JV and major decisions shall be taken by a majority of 75% of the directors present. Since there is no unanimous consent required from the parties, in the judgement of the management the Company does not have joint control over the JV. However, considering the Company's representation in the board and the extent of its ability to exercise the in/fluence over the decision over the relevant activities, the JV has been considered as an associate and accounted under the equity method.\n\n## (b) Key assumptions:\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the /financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are re/flected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights, the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable pro/fit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can\n\nbe recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fits and business developments.\n\n## (iii) Income Taxes:\n\nThe Company calculates income tax expense based on reported income and estimated exemptions / deduction likely available to the Company. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to realised or settled in the future when the Company may be subject to lower tax rate based on the future /financials projections.\n\n## (iv) Fair value measurement of /financial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of /financial assets and /financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (v) De/fined bene/fit plans:\n\nThe cost of the de/fined bene/fit gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical bene/fits and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/fined bene/fit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## (vi) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n## (vii)  Share-based payments:\n\nThe Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees using BlackScholes model and cash settled transactions with employees using binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 49.\n\n## (viii) Business Combination:\n\n## (a) Fair Valuation of Intangibles:\n\n## Mining Rights:\n\nThe Company has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Company, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## Brand:\n\nThe Company has used relief from royalty method for value analysis of Brand. The method estimates the value as the present value of the after-tax projected revenues cash /flows attributable to the Brand value.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk associated with the Brand Name, which is higher than the overall business.\n\n## (b) Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on size of land parcel.\n\n## Leasehold land:\n\nLeasehold land was valued basis the leasehold interest for the remaining duration of the lease.\n\n## Other Assets:\n\nThe cost approach has been adopted for fair valuing all the /fixed assets except vehicles which have been measured at the old book values less depreciation.\n\nThe cost approach includes calculation of depreciated replacement cost using price trends applied to historical cost and capitalisation of all the indirect cost, these trends are on the basis of price indices obtained from recognized sources such as the RBI/ OEA or market intelligence. In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## (ix) Disposal Groups:\n\nThe Company has used comparable market multiple approach to assess the fair value of the disposal group.\n\nUnder the market multiple approach, enterprise value of a company is determined by using multiples derived from valuations of comparable companies, as manifested through stock market valuations of listed companies considering Enterprise Value/ Revenue and Enterprise value/ EBITDA multiples based on their market price and latest published /financial information.\n\nAppropriate adjustments are made (e.g. for debt and surplus assets) to arrive at the equity value of the disposal group.\n\n## (x) Classi/fication of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend\n\nor terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any signi/ficant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Company's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term re/flects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate speci/fic to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## Note 2: Property, Plant and Equipment & Other Intangible Assets\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n|                                           | Gross Block                      | Gross Block        | Gross Block   | Gross Block                                  | Gross Block           | Depreciation and Amortisation    | Depreciation and Amortisation   | Depreciation and Amortisation   | Depreciation and Amortisation                | Depreciation and Amortisation   | Net Block             |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Particulars                               | As at April 1,  2020  (Restated) | Other Adjustments* | Additions     | Deductions/ Adjustments/  Held for  disposal | As at March 31,  2021 | As at April 1,  2020  (Restated) | Other Adjustments*              | For the year                    | Deductions/ Adjustments/  Held for  disposal | As at March 31,  2021           | As at March 31,  2021 |\n| (A)  Tangible Assets@                     |                                  |                    |               |                                              |                       |                                  |                                 |                                 |                                              |                                 |                       |\n| Land:                                     |                                  |                    |               |                                              |                       |                                  |                                 |                                 |                                              |                                 |                       |\n| Freehold Land                             | 6,456.53                         | (0.15)             | 115.57        | 107.99                                       | 6,463.96              | -

It is utilised in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to issue bonus shares, to provide for premium on redemption of shares or debentures, equity related expenses like underwriting costs, etc.\n- c) Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR): The Company has issued redeemable non-convertible debentures. Accordingly, the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 (as amended), requires the company to create DRR out of pro/fits of the company available for payment of dividend. DRR is required to be created for an amount which is equal to 25% of the value of debentures issued. However, this requirement is no more applicable w.e.f. April 1, 2018 as per the amendment in the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 vide dated August 16, 2019; accordingly the Company has not made any new addition in the said reserve and accounted the reversal of outstanding reserve linked to payment of speci/fic non-convertible debentures.\n- d) General reserve: The Company has transferred a portion of the net pro/fit of the Company before declaring dividend to general reserve pursuant to the earlier provision of Companies Act, 1956. Mandatory transfer to general reserve is not required under the Act.\n- e) Shares Options Outstanding Reserve: The Company has three share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Company's shares have been granted to certain executives and senior employees. The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.\n- f) Treasury Shares : The Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employees Stock Options Scheme, 2018 (ESOS 2018). As per Ind AS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation, Reacquired equity shares of the Company are called Treasury Shares and deducted from equity.\n- g) Cash/flow Hedge Reserve: The Company has designated its hedging instruments as cash /flow hedges and any effective portion of cash/flow hedge is maintained in the said reserve. In case the hedging becomes ineffective, the amount is recognised to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n- h) Exchange differences on translating the /financial statements of foreign operations: Exchange variation in Opening Equity Share Capital, Reserves and Surplus, Assets and Liabilities of UltraTech Cement Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, UltraTech Cement Middle East Investments Ltd, PT UltraTech Mining Indonesia and PT UltraTech Investment Indonesia is accounted under this reserve.\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## Note 17: Non-Current Borrowings\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n|                                        | Non -

During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company is continuing to provide for income tax at old rates, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and various exemptions and deductions available to the Company under the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the Company had applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realised or settled in the future period when the Company may be subjected to lower tax rate and accordingly reversed net deferred tax liability of ' 2,109.46 Crores for March 31, 2020.\n\nIn Respect of Deferred taxes, all items are attributable to orignation and reversal of temporary differences. Deferred tax bene/fits are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent it is probable that taxable pro/fits will be available against which, those deductible temporary differences can be realised.\n\n## Note 21: Other Non-Current Liabilities\n\n| Particulars                                      |   As at  March 31, 2021 |   '  in Crores As at March 31, 2020  (Restated) |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Deferred Income on Government Grants             |                    4    |                                            4.17 |\n| Others (Including Employee Share based payments) |                    1.53 |                                            2.11 |\n| Total                                            |                    5.53 |                                            6.28 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## Note 22: Current Borrowings\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n| Particulars                                                                       | As at  March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2020  (Restated)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Secured:                                                                          |                         |                                    |\n| Loans repayable on demand:                                                        |                         |                                    |\n| From Banks - Cash Credits / Working Capital Borrowings                            | 4.14                    | 124.44                             |\n| Unsecured:                                                                        |                         |                                    |\n| Redeemable preference shares issued                                               | 1,000.10                | 1,000.10                           |\n| Loans repayable on demand: From Banks - Cash Credits / Working Capital Borrowings | 241.51                  | 15.03                              |\n| Others                                                                            |                         |                                    |\n| From Banks (includes commercial paper)                                            | 1,621.00                | 241.16                             |\n| From Others (commercial paper)                                                    | 1,368.38                | 2,725.39                           |\n|                                                                                   | 4,230.99                | 3,981.68                           |\n|                                                                                   | 4,235.13                | 4,106.12                           |\n\n## Note 23: Trade Payables-Total Outstanding Dues of Creditors other than Micro Enterprises and Small Enterprises\n\n| Particulars                                                   | As at  March 31, 2021   | '  in Crores As at March 31, 2020  (Restated)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Other Trade Payables (other than Micro and Small Enterprises) | 4,583.88                | 3,270.99                                        |\n| Due to Related Party (Refer Note 44)                          | 3.17                    | 2.31                                            |\n| Due to Others                                                 | 42.90                   | 33.20                                           |\n|                                                               | 4,629.95                | 3,306.50                                        |\n\n## Note 24: Other Current Liabilities\n\n| Particulars                                                      | As at  March 31, 2021   | '  in Crores As at March 31, 2020  (Restated)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Advance from Customers and Others                                | 397.30                  | 464.32                                          |\n| Deferred Revenue                                                 | 0.17                    | 0.17                                            |\n| Others (including Provision for Expenses, Statutory liabilities) | 4,203.31                | 3,049.14                                        |\n|                                                                  | 4,600.78                | 3,513.63                                        |",

Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in pro/fit or loss.\n\n## (iv) Equity accounted investees\n\nThe Group's interests in equity accounted investees comprise interest in associates and joint venture.\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, but not control or joint control, over the /financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nInterests in associates and joint venture are accounted for using equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated /financial statements include the Group's share of pro/fit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees until the date on which signi/ficant in/fluence or joint control ceases.\n\n## (v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nThe /financial statements of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Venture and Associates used in the consolidation procedure are drawn upto the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2021.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of the Group and its subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. The Group follows uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are comprised of the /financial statements of the members of the Group as under:\n\n|                     |                                                                |                              | % Shareholding and Voting Power   | % Shareholding and Voting Power   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Name of the Company | Name of the Company                                            | Principal Place of  Business | As at March 31, 2021              | As at March 31, 2020  (Restated)  |\n| (i)                 | Subsidiary Companies:                                          |                              |                                   |                                   |\n|                     | (a) Dakshin Cements Limited (struck off w.e.f.

The insurance Company in turn manages these funds as per the mandate provided to them by the trustees and the asset allocation which is within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset liability matching strategy.\n\nThere is no compulsion on the part of the Group to fully prefund the liability of the Plan. The Group's philosophy is to fund these bene/fits based on its own liquidity and the level of underfunding of the plan.\n\n- (xv) The Group's expected contribution during next year is ' 2.40 Crores.

The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of /financial instruments are:\n\n- Level 1:  This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n\nLevel 2:  The fair value of /financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company speci/fic estimates. The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all signi/ficant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\n- Level 3:  If one or more of the signi/ficant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.",

The main purpose of these /financial liabilities is to /finance the Group's operations. The Group's principal /financial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of /financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the /financial performance of the group. The group uses derivative /financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity /fixed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The several sources of risks which the Group is exposed to and their management are given below:\n\n| Risk                 |                          | Exposure Arising From                                                                                           | Measurement                                      | Management                                                                                            |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| I)                   | Market Risk              | Market Risk                                                                                                     | Market Risk                                      | Market Risk                                                                                           |\n|                      | A) Foreign Currency Risk | Committed commercial  transaction Financial asset and Liabilities not  denominated in INR                       | Cash Flow Forecasting Sensitivity Analysis       | (a) Forward foreign exchange contracts (b) Foreign currency options (c) Principal only/Currency swaps |\n|                      | B) Interest Rate Risk    | Long Term Borrowings at variable  rates Investments in Debt Schemes  of Mutual Funds and Other Debt  Securities | Sensitivity Analysis,  Interest rate movements   | (a) Interest Rate swaps, Coupon Only  swaps (b) Portfolio Diversi/fication                            |\n|                      | C) Commodity Price Risk  | Movement in prices of  commodities mainly Imported  Thermal Coal and Pet Coke                                   | Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price  tracking | (a) Commodity Fixed Prices (b) Swaps/Options                                                          |\n| II)                  | Credit Risk              | Trade receivables, Investments,  Derivative /financial instruments,  Loans and Bank balances                    | Ageing analysis, Credit  Rating                  | (a) Diversi/fication of mutual fund  investments, (b) Credit limit & credit worthiness                |\n| III) Liquidity Risks |                          | Borrowings and Other Liabilities  and Liquid Investments                                                        | Rolling cash /flow  forecasts Broker Quotes      | (a) Adequate unused credit lines and  borrowing facilities (b) Portfolio Diversi/fication             |",

It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Group on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive /financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n## A) Foreign Currency Risk:\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash /flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which /fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials & spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2021   | March 31, 2020  (Restated)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|\n| Trade and advances receivables                        |                  |                              |\n| USD                                                   | 2.31             | 1.08                         |\n| Euro                                                  | -                | 0.02                         |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                              |\n| USD                                                   | 5.21             | 3.65                         |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.20             | 0.26                         |\n| Others                                                | 0.06             | 0.10                         |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                              |\n| USD                                                   | 54.64            | 14.64                        |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                              |\n| USD                                                   | 24.92            | 6.92                         |\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021 (Continued)\n\n## Foreign currency sensitivity on unhedged exposure:\n\n100 bps increase in foreign exchange rates will have the following impact on pro/fit before tax.\n\n|             | As at          | '  in Crores As at March 31, 2020   |\n|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Particulars | March 31, 2021 | (Restated)                          |\n| USD         | 7.98           | 5.24                                |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps pro/fit will decrease by an equal amount.\n\n## B) Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash /flows of a /financial instrument will /fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's short term borrowing (excluding commercial paper) with /floating interest rates. For all long-term borrowings with /floating rates, the risk of variation in the interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps.

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its /financing / investing activities, including deposits with banks//financial institutions, mutual fund investments, and investments in debt securities, foreign exchange transactions and /financial guarantees.

The Group has credit evaluation policy for each customer and based on the evaluation credit limit of each customer is de/fined.

19 pandemic the Company's operations across locations were stopped in line with the Government directives. This had an adverse impact on revenues during Q1FY21, as expected.\n\nEven before the formal announcement of the national lockdown, keeping in mind the well-being of its employees, the Company enabled 'work from home' for its employees and had taken all necessary steps to ensure a seamless transition to the new ways of working for employees, while at the same time ensuring business continuity. The Company was in continuous engagement with all its stakeholders through various digital platforms. Critical Response Teams were set up across the organization to plan scenarios and respond to the rapidly changing situation.\n\nWith the Government allowing select activities to operate, the Company gradually resumed operations at its establishments after obtaining necessary government approvals and ensuring compliance with the statutory guidelines in line with the standard operating procedure (SOP) announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.\n\nWith the easing of lockdown, operations gradually stabilised. The Company has the unique advantage of being able to cater to demand in different parts of the country.\n\nThe Company recovered the carrying amount of all its assets including inventory, receivables and loans in the ordinary course of business. The Company's capital and /financial resources remained entirely protected and its liquidity position remain adequately covered. The Company was able to service its debt obligations as per schedule and on due dates. It did not avail the moratorium extended by the banks as per the Reserve Bank of India guidelines.\n\n## Note 64:\n\nPrevious year /figures have been regrouped / reclassi/fied wherever necessary to correspond with current year classi/fication / disclosure and have been restated wherever required to give effect to Note 57a (ii).\n\nSignatures to Note '1' to '64'\n\nIn terms of our report attached.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\n## For B S R & Co.
