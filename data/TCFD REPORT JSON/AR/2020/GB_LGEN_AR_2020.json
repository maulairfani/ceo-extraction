We transacted over 60 new pension risk transfers, securing the pensions of over 50,000 people, and we continued to support around 4 million savers whose workplace pension schemes we manage.\n\n## Achieving inclusive capitalism\n\n2020 has been an extraordinary year, and I should like to record my thanks, and those of my fellow Board members, to each of our 10,000 employees for their commitment. Covid-19 is the greatest challenge to our way of life in recent times. We thank the dedicated healthcare professionals and key workers who have worked so hard to keep us safe. Our thoughts are with those who have experienced illness or the loss of loved ones.\n\nOur thoughts are also with the family and friends of Sir David Prosser, our former Chief Executive Officer, who sadly died in March 2020. Sir David was admired and respected by his colleagues and he transformed Legal & General to the market-leading Group we are today.\n\nMillions of people rely on our global business and during the pandemic we have very largely succeeded in maintaining our excellent standards of customer service. Despite the disruption to their own lives, their families and their working environments, our employees showed extraordinary dedication and commitment to ensure that our customers'\n\nThis year has highlighted the importance of investment to the functioning of modern societies - something that will be critical to the recovery from Covid-19. What we do, through inclusive capitalism, investing in cities, housing and growing companies, makes a significant difference. At the same time, our long-term partnerships with world-leading academics continue to contribute to new, unique research into ageing, climate and infrastructure.\n\nEven in exceptional circumstances, our resilient business model performed well. In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, we traded through volatile markets and over the year, our balance sheet performance remained robust, with no credit defaults.\n\n## Financial resilience\n\nAs would be expected, our financial performance in 2020 has been impacted by the pandemic. However, despite the impact of lockdown on our housing businesses, Covid-19 related claims in our protection business and additional costs to keep our employees safe and continue serving customers, our operating profit of \u00a32.2 billion was broadly in line with 2019. Profit for the year of \u00a31.6 billion was down 13%, reflecting the impact of falling interest rates on claims reserves in our insurance business and unrealised reductions in asset valuations in our direct investment portfolio. Earnings per share was similarly down 3.9 pence to 27.00 pence.",

        "page_content": "Nonetheless, in spite of a challenging market environment, we have delivered financial metrics consistent with our five year objectives set out at the Capital Markets Event in November. Our retirement businesses and our investment management business delivered year on year growth. We achieved a return on equity of 17.3% and our Solvency II coverage ratio remained resilient at 177% on a shareholder basis.\n\nWhile 2020 has been in some ways a 'pause year' in a financial sense, following a decade of consistent growth for shareholders, we remain confident and ambitious for the future. The fundamentals of our strategy are strong and our ambitions are underpinned by five strong businesses, each of which is expanding globally.\n\nLegal & General operated throughout 2020 without accessing any furlough scheme or other Covid-19 business support. We have continued to pay Legal & General employees as normal.\n\nThe Board is aware of the importance of dividend income to our shareholders, particularly at a time when many other companies have been deferring or not paying their dividends. After very careful consideration, the Board decided to pay the final 2019 dividend. The interim 2020 dividend remained the same as that for 2019, and the Board recommends the final 2020 dividend remains the same as in the prior year.\n\nThe Board's intention for the future is to maintain its progressive dividend policy, with an ambition to achieve annual percentage growth in the dividend of low to mid-single digits.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nIn the governance section of this report, we report on our wider engagement with stakeholders, including Lesley Knox's work as designated workforce director.\n\nThe Board always appreciates meeting shareholders in person and we deeply regret that our Annual General Meeting (AGM) had to be held behind closed doors because of restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In December our virtual shareholder event included presentations from myself, the Chief Executive Officer and Committee Chairs, and we welcomed the opportunity to take questions from shareholders. Full details of the 2021 AGM and any special arrangements that may be in place in light of Covid-19 will be included in the Notice of AGM that will be sent to shareholders.\n\n## The Board\n\nI am, as always, very grateful to the Group Board, whose wise counsel has been invaluable in a challenging year, during which the Board has necessarily met considerably more frequently than usual.\n\nI am very sorry to have to say farewell to Julia Wilson, who will retire as our Senior Independent Director in March 2021. I thank her for her enormous contribution to the Board during her nine-year tenure, as well as for the invaluable support she has given me as Chairman. I am delighted that Philip Broadley, Chairman of the Audit Committee, will succeed Julia in the role of Senior Independent Director with effect from March 2021.\n\nIn June we announced the appointment to the Board of Ric Lewis, who brings 25 years of investment management experience, particularly in the real estate sector. In November we announced that Nilufer von Bismarck OBE will join the Board on 1 May 2021. Nilufer has spent a large part of her 34-year legal career working with major international financial institutions. Michelle Scrimgeour and Kerrigan Procter have stepped down from the Group Board, although their executive responsibilities are unchanged. This change ensures that non-executive directors are in a majority on the Group Board.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe maintain a confident but cautious outlook for 2021. Our preparations for the challenges we face, including for Brexit, have been thorough and we are well positioned to play our role in the economic recovery from Covid-19.\n\nSir John Kingman Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2021\n\nThe Annual General Meeting will be held on 20 May 2021.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nWe are a long-term business and set our dividend annually, according to agreed principles. The Board's intention for the future is to maintain its progressive dividend policy, reflecting the Group's expected medium-term underlying business growth, including 'Net release from operations' and 'Operating profit'.\n\n## Full year dividend p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal dividend to be paid on 27 May 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.64\n\n(2019: 12.64p)",

        "page_content": "## Chief  Executive O/ffi c e r 's  Q & A\n\n## Our ambition will be delivered by balanced growth.'\n\nNigel Wilson Group CEO\n\n## What has Legal & General done in response to Covid-19?\n\nWe supported our people, quickly adapting to agile working. Our workforce rose to the challenge, ensuring our customer service was largely uninterrupted. We rapidly opened a \u00a3500,000 community fund for local charities. Following the immediate response to Covid-19, we have gone further by donating \u00a35 million to Newcastle City Council to build a prototype care home built on the learnings from the pandemic. Combining this with our \u00a320 million investment into the Advanced Care Research Centre with the University of Edinburgh, we are determined to create a generation of new leaders in care, as well as producing world-class academic research into how we can better support older people.\n\n## How has the business performed in 2020?\n\nWe delivered a robust and resilient financial performance consistent with the five year ambitions we set ourselves at the Capital Markets Event in November, with operating profit from continuing divisions of \u00a32.6 billion, cash and operating surplus generation of \u00a31.5 billion each and a return on equity of 17.3%. Our markets are large, growing and attractive, and we have positioned ourselves well for future growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is the biggest challenge for companies in today's economy?\n\nWe believe that capitalism works, but it needs to work for everyone. This is the starting point of inclusive capitalism. Companies must show that being both economically effective and socially useful are not incompatible; they are two sides of the same coin. Inclusive capitalism is a balanced vision, where profits and purpose co-exist, and everyone can build their own stake in our economy. This means that we all need to step up, with local and national government, businesses and broader society working in positive, constructive collaboration.\n\n## Why is Legal & General's work important?\n\nWhat matters to me is impact; any number of promises, pledges and slogans will not build a new flat for a graduate or deliver a secure income for retirees. That is why our team is focused on delivery - the real difference that we can make. Our teams have been working with local leaders and decision-makers to deliver place-changing regeneration projects. We are delivering projects in the UK's cities and towns outside London - this is what 'Building Back Better' and 'Levelling Up' mean in practice and we have been doing this for nearly a decade already.\n\nSince the start of Covid-19, UK unemployment has risen and it is likely to rise further over the next 12 months. It is essential that financial institutions continue to invest in the real economy, recycling pensions funds and savings into projects that help to create jobs, housing and vital infrastructure. We invest where we see growth potential, both to support economic recovery and to provide positive, long-term outcomes for our investors. Our investments since March 2020 are set to create 30,000 jobs in the UK, including at Cardiff Central Square and at the Birmingham Health Innovation Campus.",

Each of our businesses is expanding globally, adding new products and solutions to their strategic goals. We continue to invest in new business and economic recovery, with environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations embedded in our strategy.\n\nClimate change is the biggest challenge that our generation faces; history will judge us badly if we cannot get this right. We support the Paris Agreement, have lobbied for the UK government's commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and are a consistently active voice on climate.\n\nWe continue to work across the Group to help limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and we have strengthened our climate commitments, including setting Group balance sheet carbon intensity targets.\n\nWe want to go beyond investing in ideas that already exist by supporting the UK's worldleading scientific community and in turn supporting regional economic growth. Our focus on science and technology includes investments in renewable energy such as Kensa Heat Pumps, the UK's largest manufacturer and installer of ground source heat pump technology, and in Bruntwood SciTech, the UK's largest science and innovation property platform. Bruntwood operates in eight locations across the UK, including Alderley Park, which now operates as a national Covid-19 testing hub.\n\nUltimately, our work matters because millions of people rely on us; when we generate great results, they benefit those who choose us for their pensions, investments and protection.\n\n## What is the outlook for 2021?\n\nWe are realistic about the uncertainties in 2021, but excited about the opportunities.

There is also significant short and medium-term uncertainty for both interest rates and inflation, and the approaches that central banks may take to stimulate economic growth, including the deployment of negative rates.\n\n## The UK's exit from the EU\n\nAs a business our customer base is largely in the UK, US and Asia. We therefore have limited direct exposure to the EU should the UK's financial services regime not be assessed as equivalent by the EU. Our base in Ireland enables us to continue to support our investment management business's European institutional clients.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nResponse to the spread of Covid-19 has led to significant increases in public spending, income interventions unseen in the UK before and a crisis in the social care and health systems. As the challenges presented by Covid-19 begin to recede, attention will move to re-building from the economic impacts with focus on ageing demographics, welfare reforms, infrastructure development, house building and auto-enrolled pensions, all of which are key parts of our strategy.",

This 'pensions de-risking' gives companies greater certainty over their liabilities whilst providing guaranteed payments to individuals within their schemes.\n\nRetail (individual) - We help our customers accumulate pensions savings and transform them into the income they need to have a colourful retirement life.\n\n## Investment management\n\nWe manage the assets our clients hold to cover their DB pension scheme liabilities and manage their risk through matching their assets to their liabilities. We are a leading defined contribution (DC) pension manager, aiming to invest DC customers' pension assets to generate returns. We have an increasingly global business with over \u00a3388 billion of international assets under management.\n\n## Capital investment\n\nOur direct investments generate returns for pensions and on the Group's capital, as well as benefitting society through socially responsible investing. The long-term nature of these investments makes them attractive to our retirement businesses as they can select investments that match the duration of their liabilities.\n\n## Insurance\n\nWe started offering life insurance cover in 1836 and are the UK's number one individual life insurance provider. We also offer 'level-term' life insurance in the US and our group protection business in the UK offers life insurance and income protection products to individuals through their employers.

We charge a margin on the initial amount received in exchange for assuming the risk over the lifetime of the policy. We invest the margin and our customers' pension savings in high quality assets.

What do you mean by this and what can we expect for 2021?\n\n2020 saw the first truly global pandemic in more than a century. Its impact is unprecedented, and, as it continues to play out, still uncertain. The human cost of Covid-19 is enormous, and as an insurance company, we are more committed than ever to helping provide financial security to our customers through these difficult times.\n\nWe describe 2020 as a 'pause year' because operating profit reduced (2020: \u00a32,218 million; 2019: \u00a32,286 million) compared to a 10 year track record of double digit growth, and our 2020 dividend is flat against 2019, compared to a progressive dividend ambition from 2021.\n\nOur insurance and capital investment businesses were most impacted by the challenging market environment, driving the 13% fall in profit for the year to \u00a31,571 million, and reflecting the impact of falling interest rates on claims reserves in our insurance business and unrealised reductions in asset valuations in our direct investment portfolio. However, there are strong tailwinds for 2021 for both insurance and capital investment:\n\n- \u00b7 Our insurance business has provisioned for \u00a3110 million of anticipated 2021 Covid-19 claims in its 2020 results compared to \u00a376 million of Covid-19 related claims in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Our capital investment business has had a strong start to 2021 and while the latest lockdown may have some impact on sales in the first half of the year, we do not expect the impact to be as significant as last year and remain optimistic for 2021 housing sales as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDemonstrating our commitment to shareholders, we paid the 2019 final dividend and we are supporting society in a range of ways, including using our Alderley Park lab as a mass testing site.\n\nDespite the challenges faced by our insurance and capital investment businesses, three of our five businesses delivered year on year earnings growth (institutional retirement, retail retirement and investment management) and the return on equity of 17.3% reflects a resilient operating performance.\n\nLooking forward, we have reasons to be positive. Our businesses generate predictable cash and capital flows, with high proportions of repeatable earnings, specifically in the unwind of the retirement annuity portfolio, the high retention of investment management assets and insurance total premium income.\n\nAlthough we have had a strong start to 2021, we recognise uncertainty remains around the global recovery from Covid-19. This will depend on the speed of vaccine roll-out, the efficacy of available vaccines against emerging virus strains, and coordination between governments, communities and businesses. As a company with 185 years of insurance experience, we understand the importance of acting prudently and maintaining flexibility through uncertainty to play lead in the post-pandemic recovery and to deliver on our five year growth ambitions as outlined at our November Capital Markets Event.\n\n## How has Covid-19 impacted your business?\n\nWe are committed to helping all our stakeholders through the challenges presented by the pandemic. We are leveraging our technology investments to support our employees, while providing the best service to our customers, for example, by quadrupling our digital self-service infrastructure capacity during the first week of the March 2020 lockdown.\n\nOur business model protects us from some of the financial impacts of Covid-19:\n\n- \u00b7 As a multi-line insurer, our risks are more balanced, with offsets between our insurance business and our retirement businesses (institutional and retail). As a result, the impact of Covid-19 has been broadly neutral across these three businesses during 2020.\n- \u00b7 Our synergistic business model includes Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which as a diversified asset manager, is less directly impacted by Covid-19. By having a mix of asset types, LGIM's total asset value increased over the year from market movements.\n- \u00b7 Our capital investment business was significantly impacted by the pandemic and lockdown. The three month pause in build to sell housing operations was the primary factor in the \u00a3100 million Covid-19 impact to our capital investment business's profit.\n\nOur commitments to customers are underpinned by a robust balance sheet. As at the end of 2020, our Solvency II surplus was \u00a37.4 billion (before paying the 2020 final dividend) and our \u00a387.0 billion annuity portfolio has not been materially impacted by the pandemic. Just 0.9% of our traded credit assets have downgraded to sub-investment grade compared to c.1.8% for the total market. Although we experienced no defaults in the portfolio during the year, as further protection we continue to hold a credit default reserve of \u00a33.5 billion.",

See page 205 for more details.\n- ** This includes final salary pension schemes of \u00a3214 million, in both the Group's Own Funds and the SCR, and profit attributable to our with profit fund until 2019.\n\n## The Group achieved its 2015-2020 objectives a year early, what are Legal & General's ambitions for the next five years and what do they mean for investors?\n\nAt our Capital Markets Event in November we set out our new five year ambitions. Cumulatively, over the period from 2020 to 2024, we intend for:\n\n- 1.  Cash and capital generation to significantly exceed dividends - we intend to generate \u00a38.0 billion to \u00a39.0 billion of both cash and capital, to pay dividends of \u00a35.6 billion to \u00a35.9 billion.\n- 2.  Earnings per share to grow faster than dividends, with the dividend growing at low to mid-single digits from 2021.\n- 3.  Capital generation less new business strain to exceed dividends paid.\n\nOur new ambitions are significant for investors because they (i) align the dividend to specific, cumulative cash and capital performance, as well as (ii) encourage growth to be less capital intensive by requiring the business to generate more capital net of new business than it pays in dividend.\n\nIn support of our ambition for less capital intensive growth, we expect our retirement business's (LGR) annuity portfolio to be self-sustaining within the next three to five years. This means LGR will be able to fund desired levels of new business, while both contributing to a progressive dividend and building the Group solvency coverage ratio over time. At that point, LGR will no longer be dependent on other divisions to fund its growth meaning, in turn, that incremental earnings growth for the Group as a whole will become increasingly capital light.\n\nWe have already made strong progress in the first year of the new targets, with net release from operations (cash generation) of \u00a31,539 million and Solvency II operational surplus generation (capital generation) of \u00a31.5 billion. Both cash and capital generation exceeded our total dividends in 2020 of \u00a31.0 billion, which is broadly on track for our 5 year cumulative dividend ambition.\n\nAll of the Group's businesses appear to be well placed to take advantage of structural opportunities in their respective sectors. How do you expect them to contribute to the delivery of your ambitions and what does this mean for how Legal & General will look as a company in five years time?\n\nWe expect balanced growth across all our businesses with a view to further internationalise, with more opportunity in the US for our investment management, institutional retirement and insurance businesses. Our approach of using the skills and expertise we have built in our market leading UK businesses and deploying them in similar markets abroad has been successful and we intend to continue this approach to achieve our objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Our investment management business continues to focus on expansion in the US and Europe. Over the last five years LGIM's international assets under management (AUM) more than tripled to reach \u00a3388 billion - 30% of LGIM's total AUM.\n- \u00b7 Our institutional retirement business plans to deliver $10 billion of international pension risk transfer over the next five years (2020: \u00a31.3 billion).\n- \u00b7 Our insurance business intends to more than double US protection new business volumes to \u00a3200 million by 2024 (2020: \u00a380 million).\n\nIn addition to international expansion, we see significant scope for growth in our capital investment and retail retirement businesses, who currently represent 12% and 15% of the Group's operating profit respectively (excluding mortality releases).\n\nOur capital investment business has generated attractive shareholder value creation over the past five years by delivering excess returns on shareholder assets and originating attractive alternative assets for LGR. We plan for the business to enter its next phase of growth by bringing in third-party capital with an ambition for this to reach over \u00a314 billion by 2024 (2020: \u00a35.2 billion).\n\nOur retail retirement business (LGRR) operates across the full retail retirement journey in the UK. Each year in the UK, people retire with more than \u00a340 billion in aggregate savings, but only about \u00a34 billion is used to buy annuities. There is meaningful opportunity for LGRR to expand its addressable market and grow materially over the next five years as we help address this product gap for customers.\n\nIn five years, we expect to be an even more diversified, profitable company, with all businesses and regions working to deliver inclusive capitalism for shareholders, customers, and society.",

We aim for our tax affairs to be sustainable in the long term, well governed, fair and transparent.\n\nWe continued to meet all of our tax obligations throughout 2020, and we have not sought to access any government Covid-19 support measures to defer the payment of tax within our businesses.\n\nOur tax strategy defines how we manage our tax affairs, and guides what we will and will not do. It applies to all our Group businesses and shapes our approach to tax in our role as a significant investor in other companies.\n\nWe are also pleased to include analysis of our international tax footprint, tax charge as reported in the financial statements and total tax contribution in our tax supplement.\n\n## Our 2020 tax position\n\nOur effective tax rate on tax attributable to equity holders for 2020 is 12.1% (2019: 14.3%) compared to the headline UK rate of 19% for the year. The headline effective tax rate is principally driven by the 0% rate of taxation on profits arising in our Bermudan reinsurance hub, which enables us to write more business in a capital efficient way in the UK, the US and in new markets.\n\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate compared to 2019 is a result of losses made in our UK and US businesses reflected in investment variance, as well as one-off adjustments from the finalisation of tax charges relating to prior years. Without these the effective tax rate on operating profits for 2020 is 15.0% (2019: 15.1%).\n\nOur total tax charge (which includes taxes we pay on behalf of policyholders) of \u00a3144 million has decreased in 2020 (2019: \u00a3598 million) due to diminished investment returns and other losses through investment variance. Our income tax paid for the year of \u00a3554 million (2019: \u00a3540 million) reflects the continuing profitability of our businesses, the timing of cash tax payments and the impact of withholding taxes on investments held by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tax supplement\n\nOur 2020 tax supplement is available on our group website.

This positions us to grow our profits, expand our international presence, diversify by client, channel and geography, and to maintain a cost income ratio in the high 50 percent range.\n\nThe success of our capital investment business in creating and scaling alternative asset capabilities has resulted in a pipeline of opportunities across residential property, specialist commercial real estate, SME finance and clean energy sectors.

Our position as a leading global insurance solutions provider, currently the only provider operating across the UK and US, combined with our internal asset sourcing capabilities, provides competitive advantage and means we are well positioned to meet the increasing demand for pension de-risking solutions. Working with our investment management and capital investment businesses, our growing annuity portfolio provides secure pensioner income through much needed environmentally conscious and socially useful investment.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Ageing demographics\n- \u00b7 Welfare reforms\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation\n\n## Institutional retirement\n\nsales \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 8.8 bn\n\n## Response to Covid-19\n\nWe quickly responded to Covid-19 lockdown measures introduced in the UK. In the first week of lockdown, we demonstrated our agile-working capabilities by signing three transactions on the same day. Our proven ability to price, negotiate and sign transactions remotely has allowed us to meet the ongoing market demand. We have accelerated our move to digital, ensuring customers could access our services online, and removed the need for physical documents, where possible, whilst safeguarding our most vulnerable customers. We continue to support UK infrastructure investment to create assets that deliver a tangible societal impact.\n\n## 2020 key activities\n\nWe are a market leading global pension risk transfer (PRT) insurance solutions provider, allowing companies to settle their defined benefit pension liabilities, protect their members' retirement income and focus on their core business. Our long-term client relationships and understanding of customer needs enable us to best utilise synergies across the Group. We bring together expertise in investment management, asset sourcing and in-depth knowledge in mortality trends and longevity risk. As always, we remain disciplined in the deployment of our capital, selecting opportunities that allow us to invest in high credit quality, matching our long-term liabilities and meeting our return targets.\n\nIn the last year we have secured the retirement income of more than 53,000 people worldwide. We have an in-house and in-country client service model in the countries that we operate which puts our clients and customers at the heart of what we do.\n\n## Annuity assets \u00a3bn\n\nInstitutional retirement achieved strong sales of \u00a38.8 billion in 2020 following an exceptional 2019. We transacted on over 60 deals globally, achieving \u00a37.6 billion in premiums in the UK, while continuing to grow our presence in the US market, writing record premiums of $1.6 billion. Premiums shown exclude longevity insurance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New business\n\nOur robust operating model led to another successful year in 2020. We wrote \u00a37.6 billion of UK premiums alongside $1.6 billion of US premiums. We have strong expertise in reinsurance solutions and have taken advantage of attractively priced credit, ensuring efficient use of capital.\n\nWe continue to innovate in order to enhance the affordability of de-risking solutions. Our Assured Payment Policies (APP) allow companies the option to begin their de-risking journey with a pathway to buy-in or buyout at a future date.\n\nAlthough new business premiums were lower than prior year, in the UK we enjoyed one of our busiest years in recent memory, a 57% increase in the number of transactions compared to 2019. Around 75% of these transactions were with existing clients of our investment management business. We are confident that we can continue to build on our success and meet our ambition to transact between \u00a340 to \u00a350 billion of UK pension risk transfers, and $10 billion of international pension risk transfers over the next five years.\n\n## \u00a31.1 billion bulk annuity transaction with Maersk Retirement Benefit Scheme\n\nWe are an all market provider, transacting on smaller deals of under \u00a32 million to some of the largest available in the market. In December we announced a \u00a31.1 billion buy-in transaction with the Trustee of the Maersk Retirement Benefit Scheme, securing the benefits of around 1,900 deferred members and 3,000 retirees.\n\n## Global opportunities\n\nThe pension risk transfer market is growing and we are active in all the main markets. The ability to seamlessly execute these globally coordinated transactions highlights our unique position as a market-leading pension risk transfer service provider.\n\n## \u00a3 87.0 bn\n\nOur total annuity assets grew by 15% to \u00a387.0 billion in 2020.

During the year we completed two global transactions, including IHS Markit, which was our first transaction of this kind.\n\nThe deals demonstrate the continued appetite for pension risk transfer in the UK and US. Our ability to work seamlessly across markets through one joined up process gives us a clear advantage.\n\nEarlier in the year we announced our first global pension risk transfer transaction of \u00a3122 million ($144 million) with IHS Markit's UK and US pension schemes.\n\nIn December, we completed our second, much larger, global pension risk transfer transaction, a \u00a3545 million full buy-in of Evonik's UK pension scheme, following a $93 million (\u00a372 million) partial buy-out of Evonik's US scheme in September. The two deals have secured the pensions of over 3,600 members in the UK and 1,700 in the US.\n\nIn addition, our global reinsurance hub in Bermuda provides our business with regulatory capital flexibility for both our pension risk transfer business and our US term insurance business. This enables us to write more pension risk transfer business in a capital efficient way, which allows us to support new business and to invest more money in housing and other infrastructure projects in the UK.\n\n## International pension de-risking\n\nOur US pension de-risking business has delivered a record year, achieving over $1.6 billion of new business premiums, representing year-on-year growth of more than 40%. We completed 17 transactions in total over the last 12 months, securing pension benefits for over 26,000 members. We achieved our largest transaction to date, independent of reinsurance, totalling $355 million (\u00a3259 million) with Trinity Industries Inc, securing the pension benefits of more than 7,500 members.\n\nSince entering the market in 2015, we have written over $5 billion in transactions, and we are now a top ten provider of de-risking solutions in the US market. We expect 2021 and onwards to continue strongly; our ambition is to write over $10 billion of premiums in the US over the next five years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Relationships\n\nWe build deep relationships with long-standing clients who value our innovative, flexible and collaborative approach. By using umbrella contracts we can ensure the important terms are set out in a master framework agreement, with each additional transaction requiring only a short schedule setting out the specifics of that deal. This structure streamlines the process and ensures both sides are well placed to transact quickly whenever market conditions lead to favourable pricing.\n\nOur close relationship with our investment management business means that we are well positioned to support pension schemes at every stage of their lifecycle. Liability driven investment, where we are a market leader in the UK and US, is a crucial final step towards pension risk transfer, and one that supports the resilience of the pension risk transfer market as it insulates schemes from low rates, keeping pension risk transfer affordable, even as markets move.\n\nOur business model offers fantastic competitive advantages that enable us to support our investment management clients to achieve their strategic objectives whilst also building long-term relationships to secure repeat business from the many schemes taking a phased approach to de-risking.\n\n## \u00a370 million buy-in transaction with the ICI Pension Fund\n\nOur 2020 buy-in with ICI Pension Fund marks our ninth transaction with the scheme, securing a total of \u00a35.8 billion of liabilities transacted over six years. The ICI Pension Fund took advantage of favourable market conditions in May to secure the benefits of new retirees since its previous transaction, with a \u00a370 million buy-in.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 1,331 m\n\nOperating profit grew 9% to \u00a31,331 million, driven by the performance of our growing annuity portfolio and further bolstered by routine assumption updates. In addition, the devastating loss of life from Covid-19 has impacted institutional retirement in the form of a mortality experience release. The figures shown include releases associated with changes to future mortality improvements.",

The scheme has chosen our umbrella contract to allow for potential future transactions to be completed quickly and easily.\n\n## Assured Payment Policy (APP)\n\nWe completed our second APP transaction during 2020, a \u00a3397 million transaction for the Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme, which is the largest APP written to date. This builds on the success of the first transaction undertaken with the AIB Group UK Pension Scheme at the end of 2019.\n\nAn APP locks down investment risk, with a clear structure for adding the remaining pensionrelated risks in the future, helping pension schemes to minimise volatility between their assets and buy-in pricing. This solution provides a flexible and more affordable way for pension schemes to convert to buy-in or buy-out, including through a series of partial conversions.\n\n## The power of pensions\n\nWe invest the premiums received from de-risking solutions into investments that match our long-term obligations to annuity policyholders. Alongside a diverse portfolio of corporate bonds, we make direct investments into assets that support our vision of inclusive capitalism, creating real jobs, housing and wage growth as well as tackling the climate crisis.\n\nOur research report 'The Power of Pensions' identified \u00a3150-\u00a3190 billion potentially available to invest in UK infrastructure over the coming decade and that by specifically harnessing the pensions wealth we already have in this country, we can deliver regeneration, transport, housing and renewable energy investment.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance\n\nIn December we announced our ambition to reduce the carbon emission intensity of our annuity portfolio by 18.5% by 2025, and to cut\n\nabsolute emissions from real estate by 50% by 2030, achieving a net zero portfolio by 2050. This commitment was announced alongside the launch of our new Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policy which sets out the progress that our institutional and retail retirement businesses have made towards integrating ESG principles into our annuity portfolio.\n\n## Contributing to society\n\nInvesting annuity money in affordable housing matches our extended liabilities and delivers both real economic growth and social value for the UK. The investments we have made in 2020 show that we are delivering on the principles outlined in our ESG policy.\n\nWe provided \u00a3100 million in deferred long-term financing to Bromford Housing Group, the largest provider of affordable homes across Central and South West England, to support their goal to deliver 12,000 new affordable homes across the region by 2028.\n\nSimilarly, in the North East of England we have announced \u00a375 million in long-term financing to Bernicia, supporting their ambition to provide 650 much needed homes to the region by 2023, and \u20ac54 million (\u00a348 million) to Cl\u00faid Housing to enable the delivery of c.200 new social homes across Ireland.\n\n## Climate change\n\nWe recently announced long-term debt financing with HeatRHIght, a renewables funding scheme that supports the delivery of air source heat pump technology to the social housing sector. This financing will accelerate HeatRHIght's delivery of low-carbon heating to housing associations across the UK.\n\nWith the UK government setting a target to install 600,000 air or ground source heat pumps every year by 2028 as part of a bid to ensure homes are greener, warmer and more energy efficient, this technology will play a vital role in the UK's journey to a 'Green Industrial Revolution'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Oxford University innovation centre for Life and Mind sciences\n\nAs part of our \u00a34 billion partnership with Oxford University, we have committed \u00a3200 million of funding for a new Life and Mind sciences building to provide innovative facilities for teaching and research. This is the largest building project ever undertaken on behalf of the University. The new building will serve as a world-class home for the university's departments of Zoology, Plant Sciences and Experimental Psychology.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nTaking on the responsibility for pensions scheme liabilities and providing income in retirement exposes us to the risk that people may live longer than we have anticipated, or that we experience defaults in the investments backing our obligations. Whilst 2020 has seen increased mortality levels as a result of Covid-19, we remain vigilant in our pricing to the long-term trends in longevity and use reinsurance to manage selected risks. Working with our investment management business's credit and property experts we seek to continuously assess default risks in our investment portfolio, managing exposures to sectors that may be at risk in the current economic environment and, where appropriate, trading out positions.\n\nThis partnership demonstrates how our diverse skillsets and capital streams can be put to work, as the scheme is funded by long-term annuity money from our retirement businesses. Our capital management business is the developer, and our investment management business is the development manager.",

We are retiring the clich\u00e9s and complexities of retirement and helping people understand the wealth of options available. We have developed new propositions in retirement income and lending, expanding our addressable market, and there is still potential for further growth. Our investment programme continues to support companies focused on healthy ageing and innovation that benefits society. Our focus on digital customer fulfilment and our customer journey makes the process of retirement planning much simpler.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Ageing demographics\n- \u00b7 Welfare reforms\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation\n\nIndividual annuity sales \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 910 m\n\n## Response to Covid-19\n\nOur sales were temporarily impacted as we adapted to remote working during initial lockdown measures and as some people delayed retirement planning decisions. Lockdown restrictions have accelerated technological innovation to keep our customers safe and our advisers working, including use of digital valuations for properties and allowing the use of electronic signatures. We continue to safeguard our vulnerable customers and retain the option of face-to-face interaction, as we digitise our systems and processes. To help our advisers navigate the challenging circumstances, we hosted a regular webinar series to offer advice and share experiences, and we moved our equity release training online.\n\n## 2020 key activities\n\n## Retirement income\n\nA new age of retirement needs financial services to match. We are addressing this need through our strong heritage in annuities, combined with a move towards digitisation, investment in our drawdown proposition, and a new TV campaign to help eradicate the outdated stereotypes of retirement.\n\nWe have developed an online course with the Open University called 'Retirement planning made easy', providing people with information and confidence to engage with their options and help secure financial resilience later in life.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nThe intermediary channel is the cornerstone of our distribution approach, but we continue to grow our reach by leveraging the Group's internal customer base, reaching new customers through our direct digitalised customer journey, and our wide range of partnerships across the retirement industry.\n\nLifetime and retirement interest only mortgages \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnuity volumes of \u00a3910 million are within 6% of last year, reflecting a slowdown in business in the immediate aftermath of the first UK lockdown. Sales began to recover from June, as we adapted processes to the current environment and individuals valued the certainty of an annuity in uncertain times.\n\n1,197\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we entered a new partnership with PensionBee, offering annuities to their at-retirement customers. This agreement builds on our successful partnership track record, reflecting our commitment to the annuities market and is the fifth of its kind.\n\n## Pension pot tracing and consolidation\n\nAt present, over half of 45 to 65-year olds have more than one pension pot and, of those, only 17% have already consolidated to better manage their savings. Earlier this year we launched our tracing service to help people track down lost or forgotten pension pots, and a consolidation solution, for those wanting to bring their various pension savings together with Legal & General.\n\n## Flexible drawdown product\n\nIn a post-pensions freedom world, an increasing proportion of people are accessing their pension pots and managing retirement finances themselves. Our flexible drawdown product is an early adopter of the FCA's Investment Pathways, allowing consumers to select from a choice of four simple investment solutions, with each pathway aligned to a separate fund, suited to different drawdown objectives. The product comes with customer support, helping make managing retirement income simple for over 55s who choose to do it themselves.\n\n## Retirement lending\n\nOur retirement lending business provides later life borrowing options to the over 55s, enabling them to access their property wealth to fund their retirement ambitions. Retirement lending is also increasingly seen as the smart approach to intergenerational wealth management, with huge potential as \u00a31.7 trillion of housing wealth will cascade to the next generation in the coming years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 791 m\n\nLifetime and retirement interest only mortgage lending volumes of \u00a3791 million were significantly lower than 2019, driven by the temporary slowdown in the housing market in the second quarter. We have focused on servicing existing customers and maintained our pricing and underwriting standards. We saw a strong recovery towards the end of the year.",

We provide solutions that help those over 55s who have an interest only mortgage that they cannot repay, but can afford to continue with monthly payments. Our retirement interest only mortgage makes a difference to customers by allowing them to pay their outstanding interest only mortgage balance and stay in the home they love.\n\nOur Optional Payment Lifetime Mortgage product allows customers the flexibility to pay some or all of the accrued interest each month, lowering the overall cost of borrowing compared to a traditional lifetime mortgage.\n\nWe have launched our energy saving initiative that provides cashback to customers who take a mortgage with us to release funds to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. This is good for the environment and also reduces our risk as it improves the future value of the property.\n\n## Financial advice\n\nOur digital advancements have enabled us to continue providing valuable advice on retirement lending to our customers throughout Covid-19 restrictions. We have recently started providing advice on retirement interest only mortgages.\n\n## International expansion\n\nEarlier in the year, we also invested internationally in Household Capital, a specialist retirement lending provider committed to helping retired Australians 'Live Well At Home', complementing our UK business.\n\n## Operating profit \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and care\n\nEach year, around 1.4 million people seek support to find care for the over 65s.

This also creates a funnel of leads to our product offering for this demographic.\n\n## Investments in health and care\n\nOur investments in care and health help individuals lead longer and healthier lives. One of these, Current Health, a patient monitoring platform which helps people to remain in their own home, has partnered with Mayo Clinic to provide remote Covid-19 patient monitoring. In 2020, we invested in Congenica, a digital health firm that has pioneered software to enable rapid genomic data analysis at scale.\n\n## Investment programme\n\nOur investment programme supports companies focused on healthy ageing, offering 'scale-up' businesses in this space the chance to bid for a share of \u00a36 million grant funding through our role in the Government's Innovate UK Initiative: The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund.\n\nWe have helped allocate c.\u00a31 million of this funding so far in a research and development project led by Congenica which will explore the relationship between pharmacogenomics and polypharmacy. Congenica is a market leading genetic diagnostic platform that operates in 20 countries globally, providing decision support services to the healthcare and pharma industries.\n\n## \u00a3 400 m\n\nOperating profit increased by 13% to \u00a3400 million, primarily due to routine assumption updates and the tragic human cost of Covid-19 impacting retail retirement in the form of a mortality experience release offsetting reductions in individual annuity sales and lifetime mortgage advances. The figures shown include releases associated with changes to future mortality improvements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nAs a provider of retail retirement products, we are exposed to the risk that people live for longer than we have assumed in the pricing of our products. In pricing our lifetime mortgages, we also make assumptions for the long-term outlook of the housing market. Our mortgage underwriting seeks to ensure that we are selective in the risks we take on and that our loan portfolio is resilient to a range of economic scenarios. As we increasingly advise on mortgages, we inherently increase our exposure to advice risks, and we have invested heavily in ensuring our advisory business leads to good customer outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have expanded our addressable market in retirement income and in later life lending, as well as helping more people access the care they need.

This has never been more important than during the immense challenges and uncertainty we all experienced in 2020. Against this difficult backdrop, we looked after our clients and our people and have not only delivered good investment and financial performance but also made great progress on our strategic pillars of modernising, diversifying and internationalising our business. Generating positive external net flows reflects the strong relationships we have with our clients, while the growth in revenues and operating profit shows the resilience of the asset management business and positions us well for the future.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Globalisation of asset markets\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation\n- \u00b7 Addressing climate change\n\nExternal net flows \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Response to Covid-19\n\nIn March 2020, we put in place plans to mitigate as many of the effects of Covid-19 on our business as possible, including facilitating remote working for the majority of our employees. We continue to have the capacity to follow these plans and have a sufficient level of resources available to withstand the effects of the pandemic. Registering positive external net flows of \u00a320.4 billion in 2020, and growing our assets under management to \u00a31,279 billion, reflects both the diversified nature of our assets and resilient client relationships.\n\n## 2020 key activities\n\nInvestment performance continued to be strong. Using LGIM's regulated UCITS funds as a proxy for our performance, in the three years to 31 December 2020: 93% of Active Fixed Income, 36% of Active Equity, and 81% of Multi Asset funds outperformed. Over the same period, 73% of the strategies managed by our Active Fixed Income team in the US outperformed. 1\n\nIn October, we announced the sale of a book of retail investment products to Fidelity International Ltd, allowing us to concentrate on our core book of retail clients.\n\n## Stewardship\n\nOur purpose of creating a better future through responsible investing is supported by our culture, rooted in three principles: partnership, expertise and responsibility. We have used our scale to be an active and authentic voice on ESG for many years and continue to lead in this area. We are rated A+ for responsible investment strategy and active ownership from the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nIn 2020, we held hundreds of companies to account in our Climate Impact Pledge and called on the UK Government to take urgent action to reduce emissions.\n\n## 1. Modernise\n\nWe are laying the foundations for global growth through leadership, client service and our operating platform as part of our strategic pillar of modernising the business.\n\n## Leadership\n\nIn 2020, we created a new global leadership team, restructured our operations, enhanced governance and focused on risk and systems.\n\nWe appointed Brenda Sklar as Global Chief Operating Officer; Brenda brings over 20 years of asset management experience in senior operations roles.\n\nMartina Kay joined us as Global Human Resources Director, Margaret Ammon as Chief Risk Officer and Camille Blackburn as Chief Compliance Officer. We appointed two new independent non-executive directors, Professor Andrew David Clare and Eimear Cowhey, to our UK fund-management board. Chris Jones joined the board of Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) in May.\n\n## Clients\n\nWe were recognised as a 2020 Greenwich Quality Leader, highlighting our strong commitment to client service. In 2020 we invested in service quality and customer experience. We released an enhanced secure pensions portal, 'Manage Your Account', available for around 4 million defined contribution (DC) scheme members. Enhanced features include an interactive Retirement Planning Tool and greater resilience, serving up to 74% more registered visitors at peak times than pre-Covid-19 average visits.\n\n## Operating platform\n\nWe invested in our technology and digital capabilities, seeking to create a scalable global operating model.

Investment in technology has played a key role in this success, including a pilot with Tumelo, a fintech platform specialising in member engagement on key ESG issues. Over the trial period, nearly one third of users returned to the platform every month. Having built the UK's market-leading DC business in the accumulating phase of the investor's savings journey, we are now working with our institutional retirement business to create innovative solutions for retirement income as investors decumulate.\n\n## UK Defined Benefit\n\nIn August we launched our Secure Income Assets Fund, designed for UK defined benefit (DB) pension schemes looking for stable, long-term cashflows from a diversified portfolio of assets, including infrastructure and real-estate debt.\n\nIn September, we launched NavGuide, a complete investment service for smaller UK DB schemes. NavGuide reiterates our commitment to innovation and helping DB schemes of all sizes achieve better outcomes. More generally, we are helping many UK DB schemes pay their pensioners by offering a full suite of investment solutions including cash flow driven investments.\n\n## Real Assets\n\nIn September, we announced the forward funding through our Build to Rent Fund of an \u00a381.5 million mixed-use regeneration scheme in Glasgow.

We were awarded Asset Manager of the Year by Global Investor Group.\n\n## US\n\nIn the US, we reported $272 billion (\u00a3199 billion) in total AUM in 2020. We are innovating in the emerging retirement income market and will launch a new retirement income product available to US plan sponsors in 2021. In addition, we continue to progress as an ESG leader, by designing solutions that leverage LGIM's global analytic expertise, and are set to launch two flagship index and active ESG solutions in early 2021.\n\n## Europe\n\nWe established a European branch in Dublin to continue to service our European clients. We are expanding into European wholesale markets, and aim to be a leading non-domestic asset manager in the EU by 2025. We manage \u00a370 billion on behalf of European institutional clients and we are accelerating growth through local expertise. In 2020, we saw significant flows into Active Fixed Income and Thematic exchange traded fund (ETF) products and launched ESG-benchmarked Fixed Income ETFs. We also strengthened our presence in Benelux and opened our first Nordic office in Stockholm.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nWe are broadening and deepening our business across the region, delivering investment expertise and solutions for institutional clients. We reported flows in Asia excluding Japan of \u00a311.5 billion (2019: \u00a32.6 billion).

At the same time, overall performance has been impacted by asset valuation markdowns in the direct investment portfolio, particularly in relation to our two retail assets (the Lexicon Bracknell and Thorpe Park in Leeds) where Covid-19 lockdowns have exacerbated existing structural and cyclical factors.\n\nAs part of the effort to manage the effects of Covid-19, we hosted a testing site at our Alderley Park investment and we continued to back life science advancements. Our Later Living housing communities supported and protected elderly residents, enacting a comprehensive action plan which kept rates of infection below that of the national average for over-70s, whilst also focussing on mental wellbeing.\n\nAmidst a greater need for our investments, Covid-19 has not slowed the progress of our new and existing businesses as we support the country to 'build back better'.\n\n## 2020 key activities\n\n## Specialist commercial real estate\n\nWe are involved in some of the UK's largest urban transformation schemes, creating jobs, driving economic growth and boosting local communities. We are investing in the next generation of science and innovation centres, which have proven crucial this year in response to Covid-19.\n\n## Operating profit \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur direct investments portfolio has grown to \u00a33.1 billion, an increase of 9% over 2019. This growth is the result of continued deployment of capital to progress our existing affordable homes and later living businesses, as well as explore new urban regeneration opportunities and the launch of our Suburban Build to Rent business.\n\nAs a part of our \u00a34 billion partnership with Oxford University, and in conjunction with the Group's institutional retirement and investment management businesses, we facilitated our institutional retirement business's \u00a3200 million of funding for a new Life and Mind sciences building. We achieved planning permission in January 2021 to provide innovative facilities for teaching and research. Our Bruntwood SciTech joint venture has also agreed, in partnership with the University of Birmingham, to provide a new Health Innovation Campus in the city of Birmingham.\n\nFurther to our existing portfolio of regeneration projects across the UK, we have joined the call to 'build back better' through our commitment to invest \u00a3150 million in Sheffield's West Bar Square development, in partnership with the city council.\n\nWorking with our investment management business, we have financed and developed a state-of-the-art TV and film studio in Elstree, using pension money from the Group's institutional retirement business, creating around 2,000 jobs and generating \u00a33 billion of production investment.\n\n## Clean energy\n\nWe are committed to scaling up our investments in the clean energy sector in order to accelerate progress towards a low-cost and low-carbon economy.\n\nThrough fund manager and operator, NTR, we are sourcing, building and managing new clean energy assets to create attractive returns over the medium to long term. This year we have taken a 36% stake in a ground source heat pump technology firm, the Kensa Group, and scaled up our holding in Pod Point, one of the UK's largest electric vehicle charge point operators; both have delivered record annual sales this year.\n\n## \u00a3 275 m\n\nOperating profit has declined 24% from 2019 to \u00a3275 million, primarily due to lower profits in our direct investments, including the impacts of a pause in our house building activity between March and June due to Covid-19.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, we have been granted planning permission for major sites in Kent, Bedfordshire, Hampshire and Surrey for nearly 800 new homes, including the Group's former Kingswood office, which will give a new lease of life to this striking building. There are further sites in advanced planning as we expand our portfolio.\n\n## CALA Homes\n\nOur house building operations had to pause for three months this year, and we have taken utmost precautions to ensure we are protecting customers and staff on our sites. Unit sales have decreased by 26% year-on-year. Performing in line with or ahead of the wider housing market, we saw strong sales activity during the second half of 2020, demonstrating the enduring underlying demand for new homes.\n\n## Modular Homes\n\nIn our Modular Homes business, we achieved planning permission for 350 energy efficient homes at two major development sites in Selby and Bristol. Our delivery pipeline is growing and our ambition is to deliver 3,000 modular homes per year by 2024.\n\n## SME finance\n\nThrough our venture capital investments and alternative finance platform, we have continued to invest in the real economy via start-up businesses in the UK and Europe. We have invested in three new funds this year, now providing funding for over 300 companies, delivering enhanced returns while boosting job creation, innovation, and science and technology advancements.\n\nIn a challenging year for many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we have been disciplined in our investment decisions whilst retaining a commitment to financing sustainable companies.\n\n## Traded portfolio\n\nOur diversified traded portfolio has managed to outperform the market using tactical decisions to manage volatility, in what have been testing conditions globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nOur early stage investments are inherently exposed to the risk that they do not perform as anticipated.

Our insurance businesses provide peace of mind to over 8 million customers in the UK and US. Our investment in data analytics, technology and our continuous customer centric innovation enabled our businesses to deliver growth, increase market share and service customers throughout multiple lockdowns. We are transforming our insurance businesses while digitising and diversifying our distribution channels, and delivering innovation in adjacent markets though investment in fintech scale up businesses. We have paid out \u00a31.9 billion in claims in 2020, creating a positive impact for families impacted by tragedy.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Welfare reforms\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation\n\nSolvency II new business contribution \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 254 m\n\n## Response to Covid-19\n\nOur operational resilience in the UK allowed us to continue to serve customers and distributors, with fast action taken to address an initial reduction in our customer service levels. In the US, lockdown restricted physical assessments, increasing the importance of our digital new business platform and disciplined underwriting.\n\nTo help mitigate the effects of Covid-19, for UK retail protection customers we introduced deferred payment 'holidays', allowing over 400 customers to defer premium payments for up to three months and introduced a care package for members of our group protection schemes displaying prolonged symptoms. We have paid out \u00a3141 million (with net impact of \u00a376 million) in Covid-19 related claims, helping families during this devastating time.\n\n## 2020 key activities\n\n## UK retail protection\n\nWith only 50% of mortgages protected and only 2% of renters having income protection insurance, there are clear opportunities for continued market growth. We use data analytics to enhance our marketing effectiveness and competitive advantage, enabling more informed distribution and product decisions to optimise profitability and reach.\n\nCustomers are our priority and we have successfully managed our payment times as we agreed to pay over 80% of our over 50s claims within 24 hours, a year on year improvement despite a 17% increase in claims. We have focused on digitising our customer experiences and have seen a 5-percentage point year on year increase in our customer satisfaction metric, Net Promoter Score.\n\n## Gross written premiums \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur use of a data-driven approach to optimise the value we add from writing new business has delivered a Solvency II new business contribution of \u00a3254 million, an 18% growth on last year in a challenging market. We have focused on higher margin products, enhanced pricing sophistication and continued to deliver good expense management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Income protection\n\nWe have nearly doubled our market share in income protection over the last three years and we expanded our product offering during 2020. Our Low Start Income Protection product is designed to encourage people to get cover who otherwise would not be able to afford it. Our Executive Income Protection product provides an illness cover insurance policy on 'a life of another' basis for small business owners, providing funds for additional cover or sick pay.\n\n## Distribution\n\nIn 2020, our 100% success rate on new and re-tendered distribution contracts reflects the strength of our relationships with our distribution partners, developing relevant products with more benefits and choice. Our digital transformation in direct protection distribution continues, with new business momentum building in a highly competitive market.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nWe have partnered with Action for Suicide Prevention in Insurance (ASPiiN) to increase awareness of mental health in the fight to recognise the warning signs of suicide and protect vulnerable individuals.\n\n## UK group protection\n\nOur group protection business is growing fast, benefitting from data-led sales targeting, improved service and a broader range of brokers.\n\n## Early intervention service\n\nAn engaged and productive workforce is the lifeblood of any organisation. Our active early intervention service helps group scheme members return to work as quickly as possible following illness or injury. We paid \u00a373 million in claims in 2020 and funded 2,449 sessions for rehabilitation treatment, and over 1,900 members of our group protection schemes returned to work following illness or injury prior to payments being made.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 2.8 bn\n\nGross written premiums grew by 4% to \u00a32,849 million, driven by increased customer retention and renewals in our UK group protection business as well as strong new business from our distribution reach in UK and US retail protection and responding quickly to Covid-19 restrictions.

We launched Protect amongst our employees in September and over 35% have already registered.\n\n## Not A Red Card campaign\n\nMental health is a leading cause of long-term absences from work.

The period that customers continue their policies is also important for profitability. Longevity risks arise in our pension risk transfer and retail annuity businesses. Over the years we have built significant expertise in understanding\n\nand pricing for longevity, covering a range of disciplines including actuarial, medical, public health, statistical analysis and modelling. Mortality, morbidity and the risk of policy lapse are inherent to our protection businesses, for which we assess and price for as part of our policy underwriting.\n\nInvestment, credit and counterparty risks from holding portfolios of assets to meet our obligations to our customers and to deliver returns to shareholders; and liquidity risks from contingent events. Credit risk largely arises in our portfolio of corporate bonds and, where we provide long-term funding, within our direct investment portfolio. As an investor for the long term, assessing and managing credit risk is a core competency, and alongside setting a range of tolerances to diversify our portfolios, we seek to continuously track a variety of risk factors that could adversely impact credit markets.\n\nFor direct investments, as part of our underwriting decision, we evaluate the quality of the security that we will take under the transaction.

All our businesses have inherent exposure to operational risk. Our risk management and internal control framework seeks to identify areas of potential weakness that could otherwise lead to customer detriment, reputation damage or financial loss and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate adverse outcomes.\n\nWhere our businesses directly engage in house building and property development, we are exposed to risks associated with the management of construction projects, including health and safety risks. Alongside construction related risks wider safety risks arise in the operation of retirement villages and our affordable homes businesses. The management of health and safety and the broader risks of building safety are an integral part of our wider risk framework, with expertise in risk management embedded across our business operating model.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite sets the ranges and limits of acceptable risk-taking for the Group as a whole. We express our overall attitude to risk using the statements and measures in the table below.\n\nWe set further risk tolerances covering our specific exposures to credit, market, insurance and operational risks including, where appropriate, limits on concentrations and significant aggregation of risks.\n\nOur risk appetite is used to govern the nature and quantity of risks that we are exposed to. Whether we are making a direct property investment or pricing a pension risk transfer deal, we use our risk appetite framework to assess the risk profile and potential rewards to ensure we continue to operate within the ranges of acceptable risk-taking that we have set.\n\n## Responding to the impacts of Covid-19\n\nThroughout the crisis we have continuously assessed the impacts of the global recession for our credit portfolio. Over the years through 'fire drills' we have tuned our response plans for different types of financial crisis, with clear governance processes and supporting data to be used in managing our portfolios proactively and efficiently through a credit stress event. Through daily data on credit risks across the portfolio, and detailed insights from LGIM's asset managers we have been able to assess the economic environment, markets, sectors and individual names and agree actions quickly and efficiently.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, we have ensured the resilience of our business operations through enabling many of the Group's office based personnel to work remotely, using our existing 'agile' working practices to ensure adherence to the Group's internal control, data protection and information security protocols. Whilst our responses have proved effective in managing operational risks to date, we are not complacent, and continue to monitor our customer service levels and wider business processes.",

We have integrated climate risk management into our governance framework and have carried out a detailed assessment of how we could expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. Transition risk within the assets on our balance sheet is the key near-term source of risk for our\n\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties (refer to pages 44-47 for further detail)\n\nReserves and our assessment of capital requirements may require revision as a result of changes in experience, regulation or legislation.\n\nInvestment market performance and conditions in the broader economy may adversely impact earnings, profitability or surplus capital.\n\nIn dealing with issuers of debt and other types of counterparty the Group is exposed to the risk of financial loss.\n\nChanges in regulation or legislation may have a detrimental effect on our strategy.\n\nNew entrants may disrupt the markets in which we operate.\n\nA material failure in our business processes or IT security may result in unanticipated financial loss or reputation damage.\n\nWe fail to respond to the emerging threats from climate change for our investment portfolios and wider businesses.\n\n## Risk outlook\n\nWhile there are promising developments in the roll out of vaccines and treatments for Covid-19, the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain, with responses to potential future waves of Covid-19 creating the risk of prolonged disruptions to economic activity and financial stress in specific business sectors and industries. There is uncertainty to the long term impacts of Brexit for the UK economy as a whole. As a predominantly UK and US based business, with established operations in Ireland to support LGIM's European clients, our operating model has not been materially impacted. We do, however, expect the regulatory landscape to continue to evolve, although it is too early to determine the outcome from current HM Treasury consultation on how the UK regulatory framework for financial services will develop outside the EU. Whilst Covid-19 has dominated the news agenda, tackling climate change and responding to the threats to asset portfolios remains the biggest global risk.\n\n## Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)\n\nOur ORSA process is an ongoing analysis of the Group's risk profile and the sufficiency of capital resources to sustain our business strategy over the plan horizon. The process, which covers the whole Group, considers how the financial and broader business risks to which we are exposed\n\nbusiness although physical risks may impact our Real Assets business. Our risk mitigation strategy includes integrating carbon controls into our investment processes, through setting portfolio carbon intensity targets and stock exclusions, and we are implementing high energy efficiency standards into our directly owned commercial property and housing businesses.\n\nmay evolve over the planning cycle. Stress and scenario testing is an essential element of the ORSA. It is used to show us how key risk exposures respond to different risk factors, together with the sensitivity and the resilience of capital and earnings to a range of extreme but plausible events.\n\nThe stress testing component of our framework assesses the effect of a move in one or more, risk factors at a point in time. The scenario element considers group wide multi-year projections of capital and earnings across a range of downside conditions in financial markets, demographics and the broader economy.\n\nThe ORSA process is integrated into our business risk and capital management activities and aligned with the strategic planning process to inform forward looking decision making. As such, it is a key business management tool.\n\n## Capital management\n\nOur risk-based capital model seeks to provide a quantitative assessment of the Group's risk exposures. It forms part of the suite of tools we use to evaluate our strategic plans, set risk appetite, allocate capital and evaluate product pricing. Our model is also used to assess significant transactions, including large pension risk transfer deals.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group Board viability statement\n\nThe key model output is the generation of capital requirements. We calibrate our model to a 99.5% value at risk confidence level over one year, equivalent to ensuring that we hold sufficient capital to survive our assessment of a worse case 1-in-200 year event. In terms of risk based capital, market (credit) and insurance (longevity) risks remain our most significant drivers.\n\n## Group Board viability statement\n\nThe Group's strategy is developed, and economic decisions are made, around meeting the long-term protection and savings needs of its customers, and around creating long-term value for customers and shareholders over a period of many years. This reflects the Group's business and investment models which combine managing credit, longevity and market risks over long-term relationships.\n\n## The Group's long-term prospects\n\nThe Group's prospects are primarily assessed through our strategic and planning processes. Performance on our annual strategic planning process is continuously monitored, and it underpins our business planning model. We consider the sustainability and resilience of our business model over the long-term (including strategic factors detailed on pages 8 to 13, as well as longer term trends in areas such as technology and climate change), as our investment and insurance products and customer relationships are long-standing ones.\n\nThe Group is also subject to regulation and supervision, which requires us to manage and monitor solvency, liquidity and longer-term risks, to ensure that we can continue to meet our policyholder obligations.\n\nThis long-term prospects assessment is over a longer period than that over which the Board has assessed its viability.\n\n## Period of viability assessment\n\nWhile the Board has considered adopting a longer period, it believes that five years is the most appropriate timeframe over which we should assess the viability of the Group, as required within provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The following factors have been taken into account in making this decision:\n\n- \u00b7 We have reasonable clarity over a five-year period, allowing an appropriate assessment of our principal risks to be made; and\n- \u00b7 The assessment is underpinned by our business planning process, and so aligns to the period over which major strategic actions are typically delivered, and takes account of the uncertain economic environment and changing political and regulatory landscape.\n\nOur business planning process is an annual process and culminates in the production and review of the Group's business plan. Our plan is built up from divisional submissions, and considers the profitability, liquidity, cash generation and capital position of the Group. This projection process involves setting a number of key assumptions, which are inherently volatile over a much longer reporting period such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth rates, the continued optimisation of capital strategies for Solvency II, and the impact on the business environment of changes in regulation or similar events.\n\nThe Board carries out a detailed review of the draft plan at the Group Board's annual strategy assessment, and amendments are made accordingly. Part of the Board's role is to consider the appropriateness of any key assumptions made. The latest annual plan was approved in December 2020, resulting in our current five-year business plan.\n\n## How we assessed our viability\n\nThe Board regularly considers the potential financial and reputational impact of the Group's principal risks (as set out on pages 44 to 47) on our ability to deliver the business plan, and we regularly refresh our principal risks to reflect current market and economic conditions as well as changes in our risk profile.\n\nQuantitative stress and scenario testing is undertaken to enable the Board to consider the Group's ability to respond to a number of plausible individual and combined shocks, both financial and operational, which could adversely impact the profits, capital and liquidity projections in the Group plan. For example, during 2020, the Board considered the impacts of additional market stresses commensurate with a stalled post Covid-19 recovery, as well as a severe market event. These stresses included a severe global shock set with reference to the Bank of England's latest 'Annually Cyclical Scenario', but modified to reflect the Group's underlying risk profile. The scenario is broadly based on the Global Financial Crises of 2008 for market risks exposures and 2002 experience for rating transitions (downgrades and spreads).\n\nIn addition to the above, specific adverse scenarios of increasing severity which may arise as a result of the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic have been tested, with the most adverse one being more severe than the global shock described above.\n\nThe scenarios tested showed that the Group would continue to have sufficient headroom to maintain viability over the five year planning period, after taking into account mitigating actions to manage the impacts on capital and liquidity. This includes maintaining the Group's current dividend policy under the late cycle market shock scenario, but this and other commitments would be reassessed if the circumstances determined this to be necessary over the longer term. In response to the potential severe economic downturn caused by Covid-19, credible buffers and a suite of specific appropriate management actions are at the Group's disposal to maintain resilience and preserve the Group's viability. It is clearly possible that shocks could be more severe, occur sooner and/or last longer than we have currently considered plausible. The Board has maintained strong engagement with management throughout the year in monitoring the impact of Covid-19 and the additional scenario analyses performed to understand any impact on the Group's balance sheet, and is expected to continue to do so.\n\nAdditionally, reverse stress testing and contingency planning gives the Board a solid understanding of the Group's resilience to extremely severe scenarios which could threaten the Group's business model and viability. This analysis assists in identifying any mitigating actions that could be taken now, or triggers to put in place for future actions. Potential scenarios that were explored included severe capital market stresses, adverse regulatory changes, reputational and internal/external events causing falls in business volumes, and severely adverse claims experience. The results confirmed that the Group remains resilient to extreme stresses as a result of the risk management system in place and the diverse range of mitigating actions available, such as the raising of capital or reduction in the payment of dividends.\n\n## Our conclusion on viability\n\nFollowing this assessment, taking into account the Group's current position and principal risks, the Board can confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over a viability horizon of five years. The Board's five year viability and longer-term prospects assessment is based upon information known today.",

The urgent global response  to Covid-19 has illustrated the potential scale  of shock that could arise from delays in  responding to climate risk with sudden late  policy action leading to potentially large and  unanticipated shifts in asset valuations for  impacted industries and sectors. But alongside  the risks, there is an opportunity for investment  in new technologies that offer good returns  whilst meeting global goals for net zero carbon | We recognise that our scale brings a  responsibility to act decisively in positioning  our balance sheet to the threats from climate  change and, as one of the largest global  institutional investors, also encouraging others  to follow suit. We continue to embed the  assessment of climate risks in our investment  process and are developing our risk metrics  and framework for oversight and taking  opportunities. As set out on pages 49-50  we continue to measure the carbon intensity  targets of our investment portfolios, and along  with specific investment exclusions we have  set reduction targets aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The transition to a low carbon economy is both a risk and an opportunity. Addressing climate change is one of our six growth drivers and it is embedded in how we run our business, from how we invest our proprietary assets, how we influence as one of the world's largest asset managers, and how we operate day to day.\n\nWe support the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and in 2020 we strengthened our policies through inclusion of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\n- 1.  We will decarbonise the assets on our balance sheet to align with the Paris objective, which we interpret as limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n- 2.  We advocate for urgent action to mitigate the climate emergency from both governments and the companies we are invested in.\n- 3.  We will use our influence as a large investor to promote a transition to a low carbon economy.\n- 4.  We support the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n- 5.  We have committed to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing our own assets\n\nBy committing to the SBTi, we will set short to medium-term targets on our investments and operational footprint.\n\nWe continue to invest in housing, especially the affordable and build to rent markets. In 2020 we took steps to reduce the environmental impact of our housing businesses by ensuring that all new homes we build are capable of net zero carbon operation from 2030.\n\nDuring 2020 we continued to invest in clean energy, including:\n\n- \u00b7 36% stake in Kensa Group, a UK ground source heat pump technology firm.\n- \u00b7 Pod Point, a leading electric vehicle charging point operator, in which we increased our stake from 13% to 22%.\n- \u00b7 Oxford PV, a developer of photovoltaic cell technology.\n- \u00b7 Lender to HeatRHIght, delivering air source heat pump technology to the social housing sector.\n\nSee Journey to net zero section on page 32 for further detail on clean energy investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TCFD Report\n\nOur 2020 TCFD report is available on our group website.

The Group Environment Committee oversees the management of climate-related risks.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe journey to net zero is an investment opportunity but we recognise the transition risks. The development of our Destination@Risk model influences investment decision making and we believe our strategy and the policies we have in place make us resilient to climate-related risks.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe identify transitional risk impacts on asset valuation from the adjustment towards a low carbon economy and physical risk impacts on asset holdings or changes to insurance liabilities as a result of weather events. Our mitigation strategy integrates carbon controls into the investment process.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nTo assess climate-related risks and opportunities, we focus on our Scope 3 investment portfolio carbon intensity, portfolio temperature alignment and operational carbon footprint. We have set a number of Group balance sheet carbon intensity targets to align to global efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, including reducing our portfolio carbon emission intensity by half by 2030.",

The Virtual Accelerator brought together experts from across our business to test out the potential of 10 projects from almost 60 ideas put forward from all areas of the business. The projects range from new net zero investment concepts to retrofitting residential housing stock.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Using our influence\n\nDuring 2020 we continued to engage with regulators and companies and collaborated with other investors whilst strengthening our own policies and principles. Our investment management business is ranked #1 in the UK for its approach to climate change among asset managers.\n\nWe significantly expanded the coverage and ambitions of our climate engagement programme, the Climate Impact Pledge. Through voting and investment sanctions, we hold companies to account in 15 climate-critical sectors, with climate ratings for around 1,000 large companies made publicly available. Our investment management business was selected for the 'Leaders Group' by the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational footprint\n\nOur operational carbon footprint has been impacted by Covid-19. During 2020 we transformed our normally office-based operations to a predominantly home-based workforce. To capture the impact of our employees working from home we introduced an assessment methodology based on a paper by leading carbon consultancy EcoAct. This equates to 1,817 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) and is a new source of Scope 3 emissions.\n\nWhilst the vast majority of our employees worked from home, we also supported employees who needed to work in the office. This meant that our core offices have remained open throughout 2020 and we operated airflow systems for longer periods of time to minimise any risk of in-office transmissions. This resulted in a slight increase in our operational office footprint.\n\nWe have also seen an increase in our footprint from our housing businesses which reflects our growth in this sector.\n\nIn contrast, our business travel has significantly decreased, as has the carbon from the management of our Real Assets, many of which were impacted by Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nSee table below for our operational carbon footprint:\n\n| Emissions source (tCO2e)                    | Jan-Dec  2020   | Jan-Dec  2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Total CO2e (Scope 1, 2, 3*)                 | 40,344          | 46,165          |\n| Scope 1 - fuel                              | 15,163          | 15,226          |\n| Scope 2 - location                          | 20,319          | 23,716          |\n| Of which, Scope 2 - market                  | 1,122           | 3,015           |\n| Scope 3 - business travel                   | 3,045           | 7, 2 2 3        |\n| Scope 3 - homeworking  and serviced offices | 1,817           | n/a             |\n\nWe have used the greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting protocol for calculating our GHG emissions and applied the emission factors from UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.\n\nAt the end of December 2020 our Scope 3 investment portfolio carbon emission intensity was 117 tCO2e per \u00a31 million invested, down 2% from the previous year. When applied to our proprietary assets to which shareholders are directly exposed, this gives a carbon footprint of 11.0 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The carbon intensity number can be volatile over short periods, hence it is the medium-term annualised trend that is important. Please refer to our TCFD report for further detail.\n\nOur focus for 2021 is to develop detailed and timebound plans in all our business to achieve our aim of net zero. These plans will be linked to the development of science based targets and will provide milestones which we will report our progress against.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Co-operation and the pooling of resources can achieve better outcomes for more people.\n\nThe context of Covid-19 has made it even more important that our business looks to the wellbeing of the society it exists to serve. Supporting society through the challenges of this year and to position us to build back better makes sound commercial sense and is the right thing to do.\n\nWe shaped our journey to a better society around five key themes in 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting healthcare during the early stages of Covid-19.\n- \u00b7 Providing critical financial services for our customers.\n- \u00b7 Contributing to communities.\n- \u00b7 Supporting young people during Covid-19.\n- \u00b7 Creating a stronger society for the post Covid-19 world.\n\nMaking investments that drive socially advantageous outcomes is core to our work. This section focuses specifically on our Covid-19 response; for more on how we are supporting society more broadly, including through investments in the transition to a low-carbon economy and in city regeneration, see the 'making a difference' section on page 24.\n\n## Supporting the healthcare system\n\nWe supported the UK's National Health Service (NHS) by offering key workers free accommodation at our build to rent sites, offering our Bracknell site for training and storage and 25 of our other sites for Covid-19 testing, and financial support for NHS charities.\n\n## Providing critical financial services\n\nWe continued to deliver essential financial services despite the difficulties of lockdown. We based our decisions on balancing our employees' welfare with the needs of our customers and clients.\n\nFollowing the initial lockdown, there was a temporary reduction in customer service performance as we adapted to new ways of working. We quickly deployed 1,700 laptops to our employees to provide important services from home, including allowing us to make annuity payments to over one million pensioners, and our customer service scores have largely recovered.\n\nWe improved our digital accessibility and tools, with the redesign of our digital self-service platforms resulting in a 69% increase in self-service logins over 2020. We also maintained a post room service throughout the pandemic, to ensure those who do not have access to digital channels were not excluded.\n\nWe extended our Employee Assistance Programme to around two million customers, and our Care Concierge product to employees and customers. We also supported the NHS's call for people experiencing symptoms of a critical illness to visit their doctor and seek medical advice by issuing a press release, after figures showed a 40% fall in the number of people claiming on our critical illness policies in April.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Advanced Care Research Centre plans to deliver cutting edge research which will inform real improvement over three, /five and ten years.'\n\nProfessor Bruce Guthrie Advanced Care Research Centre Director, University of Edinburgh\n\n## The Trinity Challenge\n\nWe are participating in the Trinity Challenge, a coalition of 22 leading businesses, charities, researchers and educators.

We invested \u00a3250,000 and 150 of our employees volunteered as mentors to help create opportunities for young people as they start their careers. Of those enrolling in the first cohort, 61% were female, 47% from a black or minority ethnic background, 55% from a lower socio-economic background, 10% LGBTQ+, and 7% disabled.\n\nWe have supported remote learning by working with Keele University and Higher Horizons+ to launch the 'Uni Connect' Virtual Maths Club. This gave 420 teachers access to resources designed to engage young people studying at home. Meanwhile, in Bermuda, we donated $25,000 to the Lighthouse Connect initiative, with the aim of providing a laptop to every public school student in the territory.\n\n## Creating a stronger society after Covid-19\n\nWe have an obligation to contribute to a better society for older people and the response to Covid-19 highlighted the challenges in caring for older people. Pressures on our care system will remain after the current pandemic unless better outcomes are delivered through a longer-term, systemic, research-backed approach to alleviating them.\n\nDuring 2020, we took steps to support three programmes working toward this goal: the Advanced Care Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh; Newcastle-Upon-Tyne's Being Well programme, where we donated \u00a35 million for the city council's prototype care home with designed-in infection control and small-scale communal living; and our participation in the Trinity Challenge, a global initiative to help populations throughout the world better prevent and respond to public health emergencies.\n\n## Contributing to communities\n\nMany charitable and community organisations saw significant funding challenges during the pandemic. In the UK, we responded by:\n\n- \u00b7 Launching a \u00a3500,000 Emergency Community Fund in April 2020, which distributed funding to over 200 charities.\n- \u00b7 In 2020, the cash contributions made by our employees, cash-matching, volunteering and our UK and US community programmes amounted to a groupwide total of \u00a33.5 million.\n\nOutside the UK, our US and Bermuda businesses responded by:\n\n- \u00b7 Despite Covid restrictions, Legal & General America ran its annual charitable giving campaign. Between digital events and the salary contribution scheme, over $900,000 was raised for the Boys & Girls Club of Frederick County and other charities chosen by the employees.\n- \u00b7 Contributing $47,170 to Chicago's Community Covid-19 Response Fund.\n- \u00b7 Donating $25,000 to Bermuda's Emergency Fund.\n- \u00b7 Matching a total of $17,835 raised by our employees in Maryland and Connecticut for Covid initiatives.\n\n## Supporting young people during Covid-19\n\nThis year hit young people particularly hard affecting their studies, relationships, work, opportunities and mental health - and disadvantaged young people have been disproportionately impacted.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We manage \u00a31.3 trillion of investments and our active ownership team is securing positive change among the companies we invest in.\n\n## Responsibility in how we engage with investee companies\n\nWe have strengthened our commitment to our progressive diversity policy by opposing all-male boards globally and sanctioning low levels of gender diversity. We support the Parker review of diversity on UK boards, and from 2022 we will vote against large UK and US companies with no ethnically diverse boards.\n\nWe continue to promote good governance, from the quality of audit - in the wake of the influential review of the UK market led by our Chairman, Sir John Kingman - to director independence. We will vote against CEOs who also serve as board Chairs, as we believe the increased oversight from the separation of these roles is a key principle of good governance.\n\nWe leverage new data and analytics to improve our investment processes, bringing together the best sector expertise across our investment management business to determine the exposure of sectors and companies to material risks and opportunities.\n\nWe continue our public policy advocacy through proxy voting and fiduciary duty in the US and safeguards around virtual annual general meetings in Australia. We called for the strengthening of sustainable finance regulation and disclosure in the UK, EU and Asia, and continued our long-standing work on the development of Stewardship and Corporate Governance Codes around the world.\n\n## Responsibility to our employees Supporting our employees during Covid-19\n\nWe prioritised our employees' wellbeing whilst maintaining customer service. Most of our employees worked from home, with a small minority accessing our workplaces. Safety measures following government guidance were put in place in sites which needed to open.\n\nAlongside practical support, we are aware of the potential impact that lockdown, and working from home, might have on mental health. We increased our focus on employees' wellbeing by improving the mental health support we offer:\n\n- \u00b7 Provided support for working parents, adapting working hours where necessary to facilitate childcare, and committing to full pay for anyone needing to work differently.\n- \u00b7 Extended our Employee Assistance Programme to family members.\n- \u00b7 Partnered with mental health app Unmind to offer free access for all our employees.\n- \u00b7 Extended healthcare cover to all employees.\n- \u00b7 Continued to train and support our network of 100 Mental Health First Aiders.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nThe focus of our employee engagement efforts this year has been the production of timely and clear communication and listening carefully to our employees' views.\n\nWe are proud to have continued serving our customers while emphasising our employees' safety. Regular, clear communication - including new Chief Executive-led virtual town halls and podcasts, email updates and intranet content has helped employees to navigate the crisis and associated lockdowns. Use of our corporate intranet increased by 275% in-year, with an average of 18% of our people joining each virtual town hall during 2020.\n\nFor further detail on employee engagement, please see Lesley Knox's letter on page 69.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Voice Survey\n\nWe continued to listen to our people's views in 2020: our Voice survey, which gives line managers real-time access to employee sentiment data, was supplemented by targeted 'Listening in Lockdown' research.

We want everyone - irrespective of age, ethnicity or race, gender or gender identity, background, sexual orientation or disability - to have the chance and support that they need to succeed.\n\nIn our most recent Group-wide employee survey ('Voice'), our people gave us a favourable score of 75% when asked if everyone has an equal chance to succeed at Legal & General.\n\nWe previously set a bold vision for gender equality, establishing two aspirational targets to be achieved by the end of 2020 across our core UK and US businesses:\n\n- \u00b7 50% female representation across our total population.\n- \u00b7 40% female representation at middle/senior management level.\n\n| Legal & General's workforce   | Female   | Male   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Board directors               | 3        | 7      |\n| Executive Committee           | 3        | 9      |\n| Middle/senior management      | 1,322    | 2,433  |\n| All employees                 | 4,556    | 5,543  |\n\nAs at 31 December 2020\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, female representation across the Group stood at 45% and at 35% at the middle/senior management level. Whilst it is disappointing not to have hit our target, we remain committed to taking practical steps to increase diversity in all parts of our business.\n\nWe are improving ethnic minority representation on our Board. Our appointment of Ric Lewis in 2020 and Nilufer von Bismarck from May 2021, brings greater diversity of ethnicity, in line with our Board Diversity Policy and the recommendations of the Parker Review.\n\n## D&I actions in 2020\n\nTo reflect the importance of creating a diverse and inclusive business, we established a new Global Diversity and Inclusion council. The Council reports to the Group Board and is chaired by Laura Mason, Chief Executive of our institutional retirement business and our Global D&I sponsor.\n\nTo better understand and improve issues relating to D&I in our business, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Undertook a programme of employee listening and idea sharing to create opportunities and build understanding about individuals' different lived experiences. The findings were used to inform our D&I Council's strategy.\n- \u00b7 Rolled out a digital, strengths-based 'Best Team' toolkit to help employees challenge thought patterns and behaviours when making hiring, promotion and development decisions.\n- \u00b7 Reinforced our inclusive hiring practices and broadened our focus to other areas of under-representation as well as gender.\n- \u00b7 Increased efforts to capture relevant workforce data.\n- \u00b7 Celebrated International Women's Day and International Men's Day in partnership with Moving Ahead. We also marked World Mental Health Day and supported virtual Pride events.\n\nWe are among the Top 75 UK employers in the Social Mobility Foundation's Social Mobility Index in 2020, placing 42, up from 67 in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Diversity Project\n\nWe partnered with the Diversity Project to run two public panel events in support of the #TalkAboutBlack initiative. In October, we marked the UK's Black History Month, sharing a programme of events, stimulus and ideas with our global audience. As part of these celebrations, our executive sponsor for D&I led a town hall meeting with the Group CEO and Group Human Resources director to discuss inclusion. Nearly one-fifth of our global employee base joined this event.\n\nPictured: Justin Onuekwusi, fund manager, was awarded the Freedom of the City of London for his work on D&I.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nDuring 2020, our median gender pay gap continued to narrow, driven by improvements in our investment management and housebuilding businesses but offset by a widening in our retirement and insurance businesses. We have taken steps in 2020 to increase our focus on improving diversity and inclusion across the Group with a view to driving ongoing, progressive improvements in gender equity. See our separate Gender Pay Gap Report for further information.\n\n| Gender  pay gap   | 2020   Mean   | 2020  Median   | 2019   Mean   | 2019  Median   |\n|-------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Hourly Pay        | 30.8%         | 26.6%          | 27.6%         | 28.5%          |\n| Bonus             | 48.0%         | 40.6%          | 58.4%         | 45.5%          |\n\n## Learning and development\n\nWe want our employees to be ambitious for themselves and the business. We help our people perform at their best, while driving a consistent and efficient approach to their development. Conversations with our employees, feedback from our Voice surveys and our strategic workforce plan have all supported the development of our approach to training and development.\n\nWe have three objectives to ensure our people can access talent and development experiences:\n\n## 1.  Leaders deliver change and business results through inclusive leadership\n\n- \u00b7 We rolled out line manager training to create consistent capability.\n- \u00b7 We launched senior leadership development programmes to drive inclusive leadership.\n- \u00b7 We refocused our early careers and apprenticeship activities to support our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce of the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender Pay Gap Report\n\nOur 2020 gender pay gap report is available on our group website.

Have a high trust and high challenge performance-driven culture\n\n- \u00b7 We held performance-focused development sessions to equip managers with coaching skills.\n- \u00b7 We evolved our approach to performance management, with a focus on having powerful conversations.\n\n## Responsibility in how we run our business Supply chain\n\nCreating sustainable supply chains is necessary in a world where climate change, environmental disruptions and human rights issues are real risks to smooth (and ethical) supply chain management.\n\nWe have created a new Group Procurement and Supplier Management Sustainable Sourcing Principles Statement that provides guidance and a benchmark on these important subjects. Our corporate social responsibility questionnaire, which forms part of the sourcing process, explores suppliers' compliance with policies including but not limited to environment, modern slavery, diversity and inclusion and the gender pay gap. We collect evidence of compliance with our Code of Conduct annually.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nIn 2020 we implemented a modern slavery strategy to assess, identify and remedy potential risks to the business. The strategy is built on the framework set out by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and aligned to the International Labour Organization's Core Conventions and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nWe have adopted the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code to set strong standards of worker treatment in our supply chains, with emphasis on the 'no forced labour' provision. We have embedded references to the Modern Slavery Act into our policies and documentation and created new policies and supplier requirements where we have identified gaps.\n\nWe have committed to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority Construction Protocol to enable us to proactively be involved in the eradication of modern slavery in the construction industry.\n\n## Human rights\n\nA diverse range of people, doing their jobs well, responsibly and respectfully, is where our commitment to human rights begins. From the local master-builders creating new affordable homes in Wales to our pension risk transfer professionals in the United States, it is the responsible behaviour of our people that creates a real culture of respect. Our Human Rights policy - published in 2020 - sets out how we will all work together to achieve this.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nDuring 2020, Covid-19 has been the most significant risk to the health and safety of our people. Our offices and housing businesses have been contacted by regulators to review our controls and our standards, and we are delighted to report that on each occasion the regulator has been complementary of our controls and their implementation. We will continue to ensure that we put health, safety and wellbeing at the core of our operational business decisions.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe will not tolerate any person acting on behalf of the company participating in any form of corrupt practice and we will not accept or offer bribes. Our financial crime risk policy applies across the Group and seeks to ensure that controls are put in place to prevent such activity, including the control and approval of giving and receiving gifts and hospitality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-financial information statement\n\nUnder sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006, we are required to include in our strategic report a non-financial information statement.\n\nThis section of the strategic report (pages 48 to 55) provides the following information required to be included in the non-financial information statement:\n\n- \u00b7 environmental matters\n- \u00b7 our employees\n- \u00b7 social matters\n- \u00b7 human rights\n- \u00b7 anti-corruption and bribery\n\nIn addition, other required information can be found on the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 business model (pages 12 to 15)\n- \u00b7 principal risks and how they are managed (pages 44 to 47)\n\nDetails of relevant policies, due diligence processes, the outcome of these policies and processes, and our non-financial key performance indicators are contained throughout the strategic report.",

Our business has been very resilient, and continued to provide the products and services that our customers need. Legal & General operated throughout 2020 without accessing any furlough scheme or other Covid-19 business support. We have continued to pay Legal & General employees as normal and we have done all we can to support our customers while also stepping up our efforts to help affected charities and communities. I am proud of the way our colleagues have adapted to the remote working environment during this time and remained professional, committed and resilient in the face of adversity. I would like to extend my thanks to all of our valued colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment to 'do the right thing'.\n\n## Our approach to governance\n\nAs a Board, it is our role to promote the highest levels of corporate governance and ensure these values are embedded within our culture and throughout the organisation.\n\nAs our business continues to evolve and as we pursue our strategic objectives in an everchanging environment, our strong governance framework supports the Board in ensuring that across the Group we make decisions in the right way. The Board has worked closely with the Executive team throughout this year as the business has navigated the unprecedented circumstances presented by Covid-19, and the governance framework has supported agile and robust decision making throughout this period.\n\nAs a Board we were determined to remain as close to the business and Executive team as possible during these unprecedented times. For a number of months during the first lockdown phase we had weekly virtual meetings with the Executive to ensure we were fully abreast of the impact of Covid-19 on the company and the company's Covid-19 response.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020, we were required to measure ourselves against the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'). The Board has considered carefully the requirements of the Code and I am pleased to report that we have complied with all provisions of the Code throughout the year. Further detail on our compliance with the Code and how we have applied the various principles can be found on pages 76 to 77.\n\n## Virtual shareholder event\n\nIn light of the Covid-19 situation and in response to the UK Government's guidance at the time, the arrangements and format of the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM) had to be altered. Your Board very much regretted that we had to conduct our 2020 AGM as a closed meeting and that we were not able to meet with you, our shareholders, in person.\n\nIn making this decision, your Board had both the safety and wellbeing of shareholders and colleagues as its primary concern. We recognise the importance of the AGM and the opportunity it provides shareholders to engage with the Board. Therefore, we were delighted to be able to host our first virtual shareholder event in December 2020.\n\nA number of our shareholders were able to join us on the day to hear from myself, Nigel Wilson and our Committee Chairs. I was pleased that, despite a global pandemic, we were still able to engage with at least some of our shareholders during 2020 and I would like to thank those who participated in our live Q&A session.\n\nThe 2021 AGM will be held on Thursday 20 May 2021 at 10.00am. Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting and any special arrangements that may be in place in light of Covid-19 will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting that will be sent to shareholders by their chosen communication means and published on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We keep the interests of the Group's shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and our wider stakeholders at the heart of our decision making and how we deliver our strategy to achieve long-term, sustainable success. Whilst Covid-19 has made face-to-face meetings more challenging this year, there has never been a more important time to stay connected with all of our stakeholders. Further information on how we, as a Board, have fulfilled our duties to our stakeholders under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006, including a case study of our engagement in practice, can be found on pages 64 to 71. In addition, Lesley Knox, our designated non-executive director for engagement with the workforce, provides an update on her activities during 2020 on page 69.\n\n## Board changes and succession planning\n\nThe company continues to benefit from a high quality Board with a diverse range and depth of expertise and skills. During the year we have continued to assess the composition of the Board. In June 2020 we announced the appointment of Ric Lewis. Ric brings significant experience in investment management and, in particular, in the real estate sector. Ric has more than 25 years of experience in the market, and his experience and perspectives bring further strength to the Board as the Group continues to invest in the real economy. In November 2020 we announced the appointment of Nilufer von Bismarck OBE to the Board. Nilufer will join the Board on 1 May 2021. Nilufer is currently Head of the Financial Institutions Group and the Equity Capital Markets practice at Slaughter and May and has spent a large part of her 34-year career working with major international financial institutions.\n\nWe announced on 18 December 2020 that Julia Wilson will retire as our Senior Independent Director on 31 March 2021. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Julia for her enormous contribution to the Board during her nine-year tenure. Julia joined the Board in 2011 and was appointed as Senior Independent Director in 2016. I am very grateful to her for her wise counsel and support over the years. Philip Broadley, our Audit Committee chair, will succeed Julia in the role of Senior Independent Director with effect from 31 March 2021 and I very much look forward to working with Philip in his new role over the coming years.\n\nAs part of a continued focus on governance best practice and to streamline executive representation on the Board, Kerrigan Procter, Chief Executive Legal & General Capital, and Michelle Scrimgeour, Chief Executive Legal & General Investment Management,\n\nresigned from the Group Board in November 2020. Both Kerrigan and Michelle continue in their executive roles.\n\nThis year, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, together with the Board, have continued to focus on succession planning. We review both our Group Board and Executive Committee succession plans regularly and fully. In September we announced planned senior management changes to ensure smooth succession in several key roles at divisional CEO and Executive Committee level. Andrew Kail has joined us and will become CEO of Legal & General Retail Retirement, taking over from Chris Knight, who will become Group Chief Risk Officer. Chris succeeds Simon Gadd, who has held the position of Group Chief Risk Officer since 2013. Simon will be stepping back from his executive role in the summer to allow for a managed transition to Chris and will remain available to Legal & General in an advisory capacity.\n\nI would like to thank Simon for his exceptional commitment to Legal & General over 35 years and I wish him well for the future. I welcome Andrew and Chris to their new roles and look forward to working with them.\n\nIn addition, later this year Laura Mason, currently Chief Executive, Legal & General Institutional Retirement (LGRI), will succeed Kerrigan Procter as Chief Executive, Legal & General Capital. Kerrigan Procter will be moving to a new role as President of Asia, Legal & General Group. We will run a formal recruitment process to identify Laura's successor as Chief Executive, LGRI.\n\nWe continue to monitor closely the diversity of our succession plans to ensure that we are attracting, developing and progressing diverse talent.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe stand for diversity and inclusion: for a workplace where we all have the opportunity to perform at our best, no matter who we are. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Group-wide diversity and inclusion policy. We are building an inclusive culture that celebrates diversity and creates fair opportunities for all.\n\nDiversity is important to us because it generates a wider pool of talent, reflecting the broadest range of human attributes, experience and backgrounds. Diversity and inclusion have been important topics for the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee this year.\n\nLaura Mason has been appointed as our executive sponsor for diversity and inclusion, and great progress has been made with our diversity and inclusion initiatives across the Group. See page 54 for more about these initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs our business continues to evolve and as we pursue our strategic objectives in an ever-changing environment, our strong governance framework supports the Board in ensuring that across the Group we make decisions in the right way.'\n\n## Sir John Kingman\n\nChairman\n\n## Subsidiary boards\n\nAt Legal & General we have benefitted from a strong governance framework operating at subsidiary level for many years now. Our framework of guiding principles remains in place governing the relationship between the Group Board and the Boards of the Group's principal subsidiaries, promoting effective interaction across all levels of the Group.\n\nLesley Knox and Henrietta Baldock continue in their roles as the Chairs of our two principal operating subsidiaries: Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited (LGIM(H)) and Legal & General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), respectively. Interlinking our Group Board directors and principal subsidiary boards allows greater interactions, information flows and promotes enhanced collaboration.\n\nThe Board welcomes the positive and constructive working relationships we have with our subsidiaries and we have benefitted greatly from the addition of independent non-executive directors to many of our subsidiary boards.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nDuring the year an externally facilitated review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees was conducted. This year we took the opportunity to review our external board facilitator in line with best practice and appointed Independent Board Evaluation to facilitate the 2020 external Board review. Further details of the process and outcome of this evaluation can be found on pages 74 to 75.\n\nSir John Kingman Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additional details of our key stakeholders and why they are important to us are set out on pages 10 to 11.\n\n## Engagement with our stakeholders\n\n## Shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nOur shareholders are vital to the future success of our business, providing funds which aid business growth and the generation of sustainable returns.\n\n## Engagement\n\n## Continuing engagement\n\n- \u00b7  During the year the Chairman meets with multiple investors and did so in 2020. In January, the Chairman participated in the Goldman Sachs Chairman's Forum where he engaged with a range of different types of investors. Feedback from investor meetings was shared with the wider Board throughout the year.\n- \u00b7  Investor Relations provides regular updates to the Board and engages the Board on shareholder-related matters. They also provide the Board with regular feedback on investors' views on business strategy and the market environment.\n- \u00b7  We provide easy access for our shareholders to the company's announcements, results and investor information, via our company website which has a dedicated shareholder section. The website contains all London Stock Exchange regulatory announcements made by the company and a copy of all of our Annual Reports and related publications. A webcast of half-year and full-year results presentations is also made available via a link on the website which is permanently available.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  Due to the fact that this year, our AGM regrettably had to be held as a closed meeting due to government guidelines regarding Covid-19 at the time, we made a promise to shareholders that we would offer an alternative opportunity to engage with the Board later in the year. Shareholders were therefore invited to attend a live, virtual shareholder engagement event at the end of the year, which included presentations from the Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Committee Chairs. Shareholders were also offered the opportunity to pre-submit any questions they may have for the Board, or ask their questions live at the event.\n- \u00b7  In November, we hosted a virtual Capital Markets event for investors and analysts. The event consisted of presentations on the Group's strategy, financial performance and ambitions, as well as a live Q&A teleconference with the executive management team. All of the material from the event was made available on the Group website.\n\nIn what has been an unprecedented year, the Group Board has set the direction on all stakeholder relations during the Covid-19 pandemic, throughout which Legal & General has endeavoured to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct. Further detail on the company's commitment to our stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic can be found on pages 70 to 71.\n\nDirectors are briefed on their duties, including their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006, as part of their induction process. Directors are entitled to require from the company all such information they may reasonably request in order to be able to perform their duties as directors, including advice from an independent adviser at the company's expense.\n\nIn Board decision making, the relevance of each stakeholder group may vary depending on the subject in question, so the Board seeks to understand the needs of each stakeholder group as part of its decision making. Additionally, the Group Company Secretary is available to provide support to the Board in ensuring that sufficient consideration is given in relation to stakeholder issues during Board discussions. For each transaction approved by the Board, discussion takes place around employee impact. Stakeholder impact is also considered in relation to material acquisitions and strategic expansion.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  The live, virtual shareholder event (referred to on the left) took place on 9 December 2020 and was a success; a number of shareholder questions submitted either in advance or live were answered on the day.\n- \u00b7  The Group Chief Executive received correspondence from a number of retail shareholders during the year highlighting the importance of dividend income to many of our shareholders; the Board recognised how important the dividend is to retail shareholders, particularly when many other companies were deferring or not paying their dividends. Therefore, on the basis that the balance sheet remained robust, the Board took the decision to pay the final dividend.\n- \u00b7  Investor input on dividend growth and new business investment received in the first half of the year was incorporated into the ambitions set out at the Capital Markets event referred to on the left.",

We have openly shared our experience and observations across all risk categories including market, credit, liquidity and conduct. In such an unusual time, such responsive and open engagement with our regulators was welcome.\n- \u00b7  In rolling out the '5 Conduct Questions' to asset managers, we have had open and constructive dialogue with the FCA on their application. We welcome the FCA's work on this important topic.\n- \u00b7  We have shared our experience of running the Senior Manager and Certification Regime requirements with the FCA.

These surveys continue to provide us with the ability to gain valuable insights about what is important to employees, as well as enabling us to become a more digital, healthy, and inclusive organisation. The Board receives, periodically, detailed metrics on the views and requirements of employees coming out of the Voice survey and plans for how actions will be implemented to address issues raised by employees in the survey.\n- \u00b7  The Board has oversight of whistleblowing and receives an annual report as well as more detailed periodic reports when appropriate. Philip Broadley serves as the Group Board's whistleblowing champion.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  The Board attended a site visit to our Later Living site in Warwickshire in January, where it met with both employees and community residents.\n- \u00b7  The Group Chairman visited our Hove and Cardiff offices in September and met with a number of teams. During the visits, the Chairman had the opportunity to see the various measures put in place regarding Covid-19. Given the unprecedented working environment throughout this year, a 'Listening in Lockdown' survey was conducted in June, to gain insight into how employees were finding and dealing with the new ways of working.\n- \u00b7  During lockdown, we worked closely with employee representatives to create Covid-safe workplaces in line with government guidance and with an emphasis on our people's physical safety. We also acted quickly to enable home working wherever possible, including in territories outside the UK.\n- \u00b7  To ensure continued engagement with employees through this challenging time, regular updates and email communications were sent to the entire workforce throughout the year with regular updates provided on The Hub, our digital workplace, that helps us collaborate more effectively across the business.\n- \u00b7  The Major Incident Team, comprising senior executives from Operations, Risk, HR, IT, Legal and Corporate Communications, met on a regular basis during the first lockdown to manage and oversee the business's response.\n- \u00b7  Throughout 2020, the Group Chief Executive held eight virtual town halls which were made available live to employees across the business, as well as two town halls hosted in Hove at the beginning of the year.

A report from the designated workforce director, including detail of activities throughout the year and the output of this engagement, is provided on page 69.\n- \u00b7  83% of employees took part in the October Voice survey, providing 16,805 individual comments. Our employee satisfaction score increased considerably during this period and then, in line with other organisations, slightly receded from June to October (74% in March; 81% in June; 77% in October). This reflects an upward trajectory since the beginning of lockdown with an increase between March and October 2020.\n- \u00b7  The most predominant positive topics from employees reflected in the Voice Survey were line managers (good communication and support), flexibility (no commute, remote work and improved balance), employee communications (visibility of senior management through town halls and regular company updates), improvements in technology (such as new laptops) and connection (more frequent communication with line managers and colleagues), which combined have influenced the increase in employee satisfaction from 74% in March to 77% in October.\n- \u00b7  It is clear from listening to our employees via our Voice and Lockdown surveys, that employees appreciate the efforts the company has taken to adapt to the current ways of working and that they are eager for some of those changes to become a permanent feature of their work experience.\n- \u00b7  A Legal & General global Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) council was formed in October, with Laura Mason, CEO of our institutional retirement business, as the executive sponsor. The council reports to our Group Executive and Group Board, through the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, and has been tasked with reviewing and refreshing the group-wide aspirational goals for D&I. The council comprises Senior leaders from across our divisions and geographies alongside the Group Chief Financial Officer, Group HR Director, and the Chief Executive Officer of LGIM.\n- \u00b7  In January 2020 the Board once again hosted a 'Rising Stars' dinner, providing an opportunity for the Board to meet and interact with a number of the company's valued and high potential individuals across the business. This event was also an opportunity for those employees to meet the Board members and gain some insight into their roles and perspectives.\n- \u00b7  In October we announced that our two Cardiff offices would be moving to the Interchange building in Cardiff Central Square in 2023. The investment underlines our commitment to providing our people with modern, flexible working environments.\n- \u00b7  During lockdown a series of virtual sessions was run for employees to join, featuring guest speakers as diverse as Sir Tim Peake, Nadiya Hussain and Louis Theroux - with the aim of helping connect our people and providing them with practical tips for building relationships remotely.",

        "page_content": "## Employee engagement\n\nLesley Knox Designated workforce director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA year ago, at the start of my new role, I set out a plan for engaging with our employees: to /find out what was on their minds by hearing from as many of them as possible; to bring together the various mechanisms for employee representation we have in the Group; and to represent employees' views to my Board colleagues.\n\nWhat I had not foreseen was the Covid-19 crisis. This significantly changed how I executed this plan, but the fundamentals - including the basic framework of 'listen, reflect and represent' have remained the same during 2020.\n\nThis year has been characterised by the creation of virtual teams and remote working for most of us. Technology has enabled our employees to maintain connections and has acted as a leveller. The convenience of joining a video call removes the logistical challenges of gathering a lot of individuals in one place: it's easier to click a link from one's desk, whether at home or in the office, than to make a special journey - although remote working in itself brings other challenges.\n\nUsing Microsoft Teams, I have continued to meet with employees across the Group, as I did face-to-face during 2019. Examples this year included, among others, time spent with Mature Savings contact centre teams, employee voice champions in our insurance business, a group of our actuaries, and a specially convened lockdown feedback group in Group Finance.\n\nI was also delighted to be able to join established groups, such as our executive and personal assistants' group and our corporate responsibility, ESG and modern slavery working groups. Each meeting gave me an opportunity to join employees in different formats and to hear from more of them on a much wider range of issues than would once have been possible.\n\nOur employees' feedback makes clear that Legal & General has largely succeeded in its extra efforts on communication - both formally from members of the Executive Committee and informally between departments and teams - this year. The ease of virtual communication has, for many, led to an increase in the quantity and quality of interaction they have enjoyed.\n\nIt has also led to greater interdepartmental collaboration. However, it has also meant that informal mentoring and knowledge sharing have been harder. We are working on ways to change this.\n\nHome working, which remains the reality for most of our employees, is a complex issue, with individual circumstances - family commitments, physical space, quality of internet connection - combining to create different experiences. We have responded by ensuring that the right support is in place for each individual, including provision of equipment for home working, making office access available and safe for those who need it and providing some flexibility in working patterns to help balance work and home commitments.\n\nThe issue of personal wellbeing is one of great concern to our employees. The fact they feel able to discuss this topic reflects well on our company's culture. During 2020, we took material steps to put in place and communicate the availability of support mechanisms including helplines, a mental wellbeing app and our network of Mental Health First Aiders: employees who have trained to support their colleagues, an especially important resource during these exceptional times.\n\nEmployee wellbeing will remain a focus for the Board into 2021. One way in which we will tackle this is by ensuring that good governance, risk management and control are managed so as to be effective without adding disproportionately to workloads.\n\nDuring 2020, I reported to each Board meeting on the insights I had gained from my meetings with employees. This was supplemented with insights from our employee survey, 'Voice', which has been discussed throughout the year at the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. Not surprisingly, during Covid-19 the work environment has been the major theme of discussions, whereas pay and benefits have not. However, our employees have appreciated the fact that we took steps to protect individuals from financial impacts, including weighting our 2019 and 2020 pay awards towards the lower-paid.\n\nFinally, I have been very impressed by our employees' commitment to charitable and community work, despite the personal impacts of Covid-19. One example among many is the Befriending and Carers Programme, where employees volunteer to call lonely and vulnerable older people and those who are caring for family members. I would like to thank those employees and their managers who are freeing up time to enable it; the involvement of so many in community work says a lot about the values of our people and of our business.",

        "page_content": "## Covid-19 case study: Our commitment to our stakeholders.\n\nCovid-19 has and continues to have an unprecedented impact on our stakeholders. Legal & General continues to support all of our stakeholders and we have done everything we can to help our customers through this difficult period without relying on direct government funding. Our priorities are to look after our customers, to safeguard the wellbeing of our colleagues and to support the needs of the wider community more broadly through inclusive capitalism and by investing in the real economy.\n\nWe intend to be a leader in the post-pandemic economic recovery, supporting our shareholders and customers while delivering inclusive capitalism through investments in infrastructure, clean energy, affordable housing, and providing products to support individuals' financial resilience. Examples of the Board's consideration of its stakeholders and some of the decisions that were taken during the pandemic are provided below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders\n\n## Consideration\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of dividend income to many institutional and retail shareholders, particularly in the current environment.\n\nWe are also cognisant of the need to act prudently in maintaining balance sheet resilience and in so doing ensure that Legal & General plays its full part in supporting the real economy.\n\n## Suppliers\n\n## Engagement\n\nCovid-19 has created risks in the supply chain. We have engaged with our suppliers on these risks and changed the way we operate as a result of the pandemic.\n\n## Customers\n\n## Considerations\n\nOur commitment to supporting our customers will not waver and we have continued to provide service to our customers, whether it is helping them to keep their family financially secure after the death of a loved one, paying annuities or assisting someone with a long-term illness to meet their mortgage repayments.\n\nOur purpose is to provide financial stability to our customers and their dependants in good times and in bad: it is 'what we do'. The human cost of Covid-19 has, regrettably, been high for many Legal & General customers, including holders of life insurance policies and annuitants who have lost their lives prematurely. We continue to pay all valid claims and we have prioritised giving a rapid but sensitive service to bereaved families.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThe Board observed that, notwithstanding significant market volatility, the Group had delivered a resilient performance in the year to date and our balance sheet had remained robust, with the Group's solvency ratio in the high-170s. As such, the Board declared an interim dividend of 4.93 pence per share and a final dividend of 12.64 pence per share, resulting in a 2019 full-year dividend of 17.57 pence per share.\n\nIn November 2020 we held a Capital Markets day where we set out our new five-year financial ambitions plan for the Group. The Board intends to grow the dividend at low to mid-single digits.\n\nThe Board was disappointed that due to the UK Government's guidance at the time, the arrangements and format of the 2020 AGM had to be altered and shareholders were not able to attend in person. In making this decision, the Board had both the safety and wellbeing of shareholders and colleagues as its primary concern. The Board recognised the importance of the AGM and the opportunity it provides shareholders to meet and engage with the Board, and so a virtual shareholder event was held in December 2020, at which shareholders were provided the opportunity to ask any questions they had for the Board.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nA successful collaborative Microsoft Teams event was held in September with a number of our key suppliers in order to maintain engagement during lockdown and to explore new ways of working.\n\nOne-to-one sessions have been held throughout the year with the Executives of a number of our key suppliers in order to maintain contact, understand the latest impact of Covid-19 on their business and establish any opportunities for assistance or development.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nWe have made a number of changes to our customer journey during the pandemic:\n\n- \u00b7  Temporarily extended annuity quote guarantee periods.\n- \u00b7  Advisers can get new business quotes via the portals and use 'Track My Apps' to check progress on existing applications.\n- \u00b7  Introduced a signature-free application and paperless drawdown processes.\n- \u00b7  Legal & General Home Finance (LGHF) made its entire programme of educational events for advisers available online and implemented a desktop valuation service for its lifetime mortgage product range, which enables property valuations without a home visit.\n- \u00b7  LGHF allowed all Optional Payment Lifetime Mortgage (OPLM) customers to miss up to three monthly interest payments, without these counting towards the six missed payments allowed in the product terms.\n- \u00b7  During the first half of the year we paid \u00a3939 million of Legal & General Insurance protection claims and, with more than three million people in the UK relying on Legal & General for financial security in retirement, we have maintained our most important business services largely uninterrupted, which includes paying annuities to over one million pensioners.",

We have continued to pay Legal & General employees as normal.\n\nOur robust, well-embedded remote working solutions have helped keep employees engaged and efficient throughout the shift to home working.\n\nEmployees appreciate our efforts, and this is demonstrated by a seven-point increase in employee satisfaction scores since before the Covid-19 lockdown\n\n## Outcomes\n\nWe supported research and testing by accelerating components of our \u00a320 million partnership with Edinburgh University's research into elderly care and being one of the UK's largest Covid-19 testing sites through our investment in Bruntwood SciTech Alderley Park.\n\nAdditionally, we have looked to address the needs of local communities in respect of Covid-19; including the establishment of a \u00a3500,000 Community Fund.\n\nWe are stepping up support for relevant Corporate Social Responsibility projects which address, in particular, the impact of the pandemic on the older population and those using social care.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThe Group Board gave careful consideration to the PRA's letter of March 2020 and has continued to engage the regulator in our dividend discussions.\n\nWe have maintained active and open engagement with our regulators during the Covid-19 pandemic and have shared our experience and observations across all risk categories. In addition to ongoing dialogue, regular reports on customer service and insights were provided to our regulators.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have provided monthly updates to the PRA on the Group's Solvency II capital and liquidity positions.\n\nThe Mastertrust Trustees have engaged with The Pensions Regulator (TPR) during the pandemic to provide the regulator with additional information on how we are engaging with our members and ensuring continuity of service in a remote environment.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nWe have supported our employees' mental and physical wellbeing through a number of resources including trained Mental Health First Aiders, a confidential employee assistance helpline and a dedicated Covid-19 intranet hub.\n\nWe have increased the frequency of our employee Voice surveys during the pandemic to ensure we are engaged with our workforce and held a number of virtual town hall meetings with our senior leadership team.\n\nIn October 2020 we announced that we would relocate our two Group offices in Wales to a 120,000 sq. ft. facility in Cardiff's Central Square as part of a wider \u00a3450 million regeneration scheme. This announcement marks one of the largest office lettings in the UK this year and the state-of-the-art new office and associated services will provide staff with a collaborative, agile space to meet changes to working practices in the wake of Covid-19. It will incorporate a focus on staff wellness and well-being, incorporating cycle and changing facilities, caf\u00e9, social space and an external terrace to meet shifting needs.",

        "page_content": "## Governance report\n\n## The UK Corporate Governance Code committed to the highest standards\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') emphasises the role of good corporate governance in achieving long-term sustainable success. The principles of the Code are the standards against which we are required to measure ourselves during the year. The information on the following pages explains how we have applied the principles of the Code in practice during the year. The information required under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 can be found in the Directors' report on pages 248 to 251. Each year, the Board reviews the Group's corporate governance framework and compliance with the Code. Pages 76 to 77 set out at a high level how we have complied with each of the principles.\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance across the Group to support the delivery of our strategy, positive stakeholder relationships and the creation of long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.\n\n## The Board\n\nThe table in the adjacent column sets out the changes to the Board that have taken place over the course of the year. Ric Lewis was appointed to the Group Board as an independent nonexecutive director on 18 June 2020, bringing to the Board significant experience in investment management and, in particular, a focus on the real estate sector. The company announced the appointment of Nilufer von Bismarck OBE as an independent non-executive director on 26 November 2020. Nilufer will join the Board on 1 May 2021 and will bring to the Board extensive experience in financial services.\n\nJulia Wilson, the company's Senior Independent Director, will be stepping down from the Board on 31 March 2021 following a nine-year tenure. Philip Broadley, Chair of the Audit Committee, will take on the position of Senior Independent Director following Julia's departure. As part of a continued focus on governance best practice and to streamline executive representation on the Board, Kerrigan Procter, Chief Executive LGC, and Michelle Scrimgeour, Chief Executive LGIM, resigned from the Group Board in November 2020. Both Kerrigan and Michelle continue in their executive roles.\n\nWhen considering the appointments of new directors, the Board has been mindful of the contribution and skillset that each new appointee will bring to the Board. The Board continues to focus on maintaining a wellbalanced and diversified Board with the right mix of individuals who can apply their wider business knowledge and experiences to the setting and oversight of delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\n## Changes to the Board during the year and to the date of this report\n\n| Appointments                    | Resignations                         |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Ric Lewis 18 June 2020          | Kerrigan Procter 26 November 2020    |\n| Nilufer von Bismarck 1 May 2021 | Michelle Scrimgeour 26 November 2020 |\n|                                 | Julia Wilson 31 March 2021           |\n\n## How the Board operates\n\nThe Board is led by the Chairman, Sir John Kingman. The day-to-day management of the company is led by Nigel Wilson, the Group Chief Executive Officer. The non-executive directors play a key role in our governance framework and culture, and their roles are not limited to the boardroom. Examples of some of the other activities they have undertaken during the course of the year are set out on page 76.\n\nThe Board is accountable for the long-term success of the company by setting the Group's strategic objectives and monitoring performance against those objectives. The Board meets formally on a regular basis and at each meeting considers business performance, strategic proposals, acquisitions and material transactions in the context of the Group's strategic plans, risk appetite, the interests of the Group's stakeholders and our social purpose. The Board and its subsidiaries operate within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, which is fully embedded across the Group.\n\nThe delegated authority framework ensures that there is an appropriate level of Board contribution to, and oversight of, key decisions, and that the day-to-day business is managed effectively. The delegated authority framework includes a clearly defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board. The types of matters reserved include, amongst other things, matters relating to the Group's strategic plan, material transactions, risk appetite, and oversight of systems of internal control and corporate governance policies. Those matters which are not reserved are delegated by the Board to Group level committees and to the Group Chief Executive Officer who then delegates decision making onward to the Group Capital Committee, an executive decision-making forum, and his direct reports.\n\n## How the Board spent its time in 2020\n\nThe Board held eight full formal Board meetings during 2020, including two strategy events. In addition, in order to maintain strong oversight of the impact of Covid-19 on the Group and the Group's response to it, the Board held weekly Board calls for a number of months. Board sub-committees were also constituted on a number of occasions in order to deal with matters arising in the ordinary course of business outside of the formal schedule of meetings. A table of individual Board member attendance at the formal Board and Committee meetings is provided on page 77. The nonexecutive directors have a private meeting without the executives present after each Board meeting and otherwise when required. The non-executive directors meet without the executive directors and the Chair periodically to review the Chair's performance. Board members met informally with the executive and senior management on a regular basis outside of the formal meeting schedule.\n\nThe Board agenda is set by the Chairman and consists of the following broad discussion areas:\n\n- \u00b7 An update from the Group Chief Executive, the Group Chief Financial Officer and a report from each of the key business divisions on business performance, key business initiatives, customer and employee engagement, control environment and culture.\n- \u00b7 Discussions on strategic ambitions, proposals, acquisitions, material transactions and other material initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Risk and compliance matters.\n- \u00b7 Legal and governance matters; and\n- \u00b7 People and employee engagement matters.\n\nThe Board informs itself of the views of shareholders on a regular basis through regular updates from the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer, as well as an annual update from the Chair following his annual schedule of investor meetings.\n\nMembers of the senior management team and, as appropriate, individuals from the relevant business areas are invited to attend Board meetings in relation to key items, allowing the Board the opportunity to debate and challenge on initiatives directly with the senior management team along with the executive directors.",

This included a review of the divisional  strategic objectives, initiatives and financial and non-financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). \u00b7  The Board held a full day strategy event in April which covered, among other things, the work undertaken across the Group under the Group's  new strategic driver 'Addressing Climate Change'. and the continued focus on scaling asset origination capabilities in Legal & General Capital. \u00b7  The Board held a further two-day strategy event in October to discuss progress against the Group's strategic plan and how the Board                                                                     |\n| Covid-19                        | \u00b7  The Board met regularly to scrutinise the impact of Covid-19 on the Group and the Group's response to it, including informally on a weekly  basis during the first lockdown period. \u00b7  Discussions and actions focused on ensuring the continued resilience of the Group both financially and operationally, the continued servicing  of the Group's customers and ensuring the safety of the Group's people, in addition to the close monitoring of the wider macro-economic  environment. Further detail on our commitment to our stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic can be found on pages 70 to 71.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Governance and  risk management | \u00b7  An external Board evaluation took place in the later part of 2020. For this review the Board retained a new board evaluator, Independent  Board Evaluation. Detailed recommendations arising from the evaluation were developed and an action plan was subsequently adopted  by the Board.  \u00b7  Following recommendations from the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board approved the appointments of two  new non-executive directors to the Board. \u00b7  The Board regularly received and discussed reports from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary on legal matters, emerging  regulation and governance changes. \u00b7  The Board regularly received and discussed reports from the Chief Risk Officer on risk and compliance matters, including an annual report                                                                                                                                   |\n| Stakeholders                    | \u00b7  During the year, the Board regularly considered the Group's relationship with various stakeholder groups. It discussed customers,  shareholder matters, employee engagement, and the Group's impact on, and relationship with, wider society and the environment.   The Board has focused deep dives on such areas, for example sessions with the executive nominated as the Group's Customer Champion,  and it considered these matters as part of its decision making on strategic proposals. \u00b7  Employee engagement continued to be a focus for the Board in 2020 with Lesley Knox, the designated workforce director, providing regular  updates on engagement with the workforce, the results of the employee surveys and visits to a number of Legal & General office locations. \u00b7  Board members met regularly through the year with key regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority. |\n\n## Ensuring our directors have the right skills and experience to maintain an effective Board\n\nThe Board believes that continuous director training and development is important to maximise the effectiveness of the Board. The Chairman is assisted by the Group Company Secretary in providing all new directors with a comprehensive induction programme on joining the Board. This includes a series of meetings with members of the Board and with the Group's operational and functional leadership, external advisers to the Group and a programme of meetings with staff. This ensures directors obtain a detailed insight of the Group, its businesses and governance framework as well as the regulatory macro environment in which it operates.\n\nThe key areas of the Board's induction programme include:\n\n- \u00b7 An introduction to the Group's corporate structure, governance framework and guiding principle.\n- \u00b7 A meeting with the Group Company Secretary who provides detail on the roles and responsibilities of the Board, delegated authority framework, listed company requirements and the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and how the Group complies with its principles.\n- \u00b7 Meetings with the CEO of each business division to receive an overview of each business area including information around strategic goals, risk overview and management, customers, and key financial and non-financial KPIs.\n- \u00b7 Meetings with members of the Board, the Executive Committee and senior management, covering areas such as:\n- -Group risk management\n- -risk and compliance\n- -finance\n- -remuneration\n- -investor relations and corporate affairs.\n- \u00b7 A meeting with the Group Actuary focusing on regulatory capital and the Group's Internal Model.\n- \u00b7 Meetings with the Chairs of the Risk, Remuneration and Audit Committees.\n- \u00b7 A meeting with the external auditor.\n\nIn addition, all Board members receive continuing education and development at regular intervals throughout the year. It is the responsibility of the Chair to ensure all directors have the necessary knowledge and training. Board and Committee meetings are used regularly to update the Board on developments in the areas in which the Group operates, and specific training sessions for directors are scheduled for key topical issues. In the year, each director was given the opportunity to meet with the Group HR director to discuss any specific focus areas for training. For example, in 2020 the Board received detailed training sessions on our Climate Change Virtual Accelerator Programme, operational resilience, risk and change management, and the LGIM strategic operating model. Other development activities undertaken throughout 2020 included deep dives into the Group's annuity asset portfolio, international Pension Risk Transfer (PRT) ambitions, and best practice around governance controls when considering IT change. The Group Board non-executive directors also visited our business operations in different locations and attended one-to-one briefing sessions with key members of the senior management team on a regular basis over the year.",

        "page_content": "## Governance report continued\n\n## Technology Committee\n\nThe Technology Committee (previously named Group IT Committee) was initially established in January 2018. The Committee was established primarily to provide assurance to the Board on the delivery of the company's programme to implement planned enhancements to the Group's IT estate, to ensure the Group was operating within its targeted access management, information security and cyber risk appetite. Following the successful delivery of the 2018 enhancements to the IT estate and significant improvements in the Group's IT controls, in July 2020 the IT Committee decided to re-focus its attention on more strategic matters. As part of this transition, two executive committees reporting into the Technology Committee were refocused to allow the Technology Committee to place reliance on the IT mechanisms and controls in place at an executive level. In addition, the meetings were lengthened to facilitate more comprehensive strategic discussion. The Technology Committee now focuses primarily on the company's IT, digital and cyber strategies and their implementation plans.\n\nIts other responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Overseeing the control environment in place for information technology and cyber security.\n- \u00b7 Overseeing technology aspects of major change programmes and understanding their strategic contribution and risks; and\n- \u00b7 Reviewing risks relating to IT and cyber security and plans for mitigation or treatment.\n\nThe Committee membership comprises the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Chair of the Risk Committee. One of the Group CEO, Group CFO, Chief Risk Officer and Group IT Director are expected to attend all meetings; in practice, all four of these executive members attend. The Committee is advised by three independent cyber and IT experts. The Committee met five times during 2020.\n\nThe Group IT community was at the forefront of the Group's Covid-19 response as the company moved to a more agile way of working. The Technology Committee received in depth and regular updates on the Covid-19 technology response, on an ad hoc basis at the beginning of the pandemic and in the regular meeting cycle thereafter.\n\nIn 2020 the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Focused on the Group's cyber security, information security and access management programmes.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and endorsed the organisation and operating model in place for IT and cyber security and subsequently considered its ongoing suitability.\n- \u00b7 Maintained oversight of the overall resilience of the Group's IT systems.\n- \u00b7 Maintained oversight of the Group's IT, digital and cyber strategies and the corresponding implementation plans; and\n- \u00b7 Received deep dive insights into major IT and cyber programmes across the Group.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board is essential to the success of the Group. The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous review of its performance and that of its Committees and individual directors each year. During 2019, the Board undertook an externally-facilitated internal review, with a series of outcomes reported in 2020. The recommendations from the 2019 review and the progress the company has made against those recommendations are reported in more detail below.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the Board commissions externally facilitated reviews regularly. During 2020 the Board agreed it would be beneficial to undertake an external evaluation. The Board tendered for the evaluation provider to ensure that the evaluation process was independent, robust and meaningful. This tender was led by the Chairman and the Group Company Secretary. Following this tender, the 2020 evaluation was facilitated by Ffion Hague at Independent Board Evaluation (IBE), an external Board review specialist. IBE had not previously undertaken a Board evaluation for the company, and has no other connection with the company or individual directors.\n\nThe aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of the Board, both as a collective unitary Board, and at individual Board member level, in order to implement any actions required to become a more effective Board. The performance of each of the Board Committees was also assessed and the evaluation included a review of the Chairman's performance. Interviews were conducted with every Board member, according to a set agenda tailored for the Board, which had been agreed in advance with the Chairman and Group Company Secretary. In addition, interviews were held with senior management and advisers who interacted regularly with the Board. Ffion Hague observed a Board meeting and a meeting of each of the Board Committees. Ffion also had access to the papers for each of those meetings. Following the final report, recommendations were considered by the Board and shared with each Committee, and an action plan for areas of focus was agreed. As part of the final report, the Board asked IBE to share good practice observed in other companies. This good practice was built into the action plan, where appropriate.\n\nThe Board review focused on, among other things: Board accountability, focus and priorities; Board composition, expertise, decision-making and dynamics; succession planning; selection and induction of new members; oversight and implementation of strategy; communication and relationship with stakeholders; risk management; governance, including links with subsidiary boards; and Board support, including resourcing and quality and volume of papers and presentations. The tone of the feedback was very positive overall. A summary of key recommendations from the review is set out below. Progress to implement the recommendations from the review is monitored by the Group Company Secretary and reported to the Board at each Board meeting. IBE have agreed with the summary of the evaluation process as set out above, and the summary of the recommendations as set out on the following page.",

        "page_content": "## Committed to the highest standards\n\nCompliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code: For the year ended 31 December 2020, we are pleased to report that we have applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Code.\n\n## 1. Board leadership and company purpose A. Board's role\n\nThere is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board that sets out the structure under which the Board manages its responsibilities, providing guidance on how it discharges its authority and manages the Board's activities. Our governance framework means we have a robust decision making process and a clear framework within which decisions can be made and strategy can be delivered. Our delegated authority framework ensures that decisions are taken by the right people at the right level with accountability up to the Board, and enables an appropriate level of debate, challenge and support in the decision making process. The company continues to be led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board; A yearly planner is reviewed at each Board meeting to ensure the most important and current topics are discussed at meetings throughout the year. The Board's main activities throughout the year are detailed on pages 72 to 73.\n\n## B. Purpose and Culture\n\nThe Board's agenda is set by the Chairman and deals with those matters relating to the Group's strategic plan, risk appetite, and systems of internal control and corporate governance policies. The Board held a strategy meeting in April 2020 and met for a two day strategy event in October 2020 to consider the Group's strategy. The Board regularly reviews the Chief Risk Officer conduct report, providing insight into culture across the organisation and helping to ensure behaviours throughout the business align with the company's purpose, values and strategy. Furthermore, the Board is responsible for overseeing implementation of the groupwide diversity and inclusion policy which applies to all individuals directly employed by the Group and forms the basis of engagement with customers and suppliers. Board members participate in site visits enabling them to meet with employees and gain first-hand insight into culture in the various business divisions. The Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer have also hosted virtual town hall events throughout the year. Additionally, when the Board is considering entering a new market or business area, culture plays a major part in discussions and Board members remain conscious of the need to embed the company's inclusive culture in any new business. Building an inclusive culture enables innovation, better decision making and embodiment of our three behaviours: straightforward, collaborative and purposeful. Further information on the purpose of the company is provided on page 6.\n\n## C. Resources and controls\n\nMatters delegated to the Group Chief Executive include managing the Group's business in line with the strategic plan and approved risk appetite, and responsibility for the operation of the internal control framework. The Group Risk Committee assists the Board in the oversight of the risks to which the Group may be exposed and provides the Board with strategic advice in relation to current and potential future risk exposures. The risk management framework supports the informed risk taking by our businesses, setting out those rewarded risks that we are prepared to be exposed to and the risks that we want to avoid. Further information on risk management can be found on pages 40 to 47.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nBoard members take an active role in engaging with shareholders and wider stakeholders. Further information on the Board's engagement with stakeholders can be found on pages 64 to 67. Board members receive feedback at each Board meeting from Lesley Knox on her role as designated workforce director and periodic feedback from the employee Voice survey enabling them to assess and monitor culture.\n\n## E. Workforce engagement\n\nIn addition to Board members' site visits, the designated workforce director meets with employees of various grades and across business divisions throughout the year, enabling visibility of workforce policies and practices across the organisation and how these align with the company's values and the Group's behaviours. There is a whistleblowing hotline available for any members of the workforce who wish to raise any concern of wrongdoing in the workplace. The Board has oversight of whistleblowing and routinely receives reports arising from its operation. Additionally, employees are encouraged to share their views through the Voice survey and with the designated workforce director. Further details are available on page 69.\n\n## 2. Division of responsibilities F. Role of the Chairman\n\nThe Chairman sets the agendas for meetings, manages the meeting timetable and encourages an open and constructive dialogue during meetings, inviting the views of all Board members.\n\n## G. Composition of the Board\n\nIn addition to the Chairman, the Board comprises seven independent non-executive directors and two executive directors. The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive are clearly defined and the role profiles are reviewed as part of the annual governance review undertaken by the Board. Sir John Kingman, the Chairman, is responsible for leading the Board while Nigel Wilson, Group Chief Executive, is responsible for the day-to-day management of\n\nthe company within the parameters of the strategy set by the Board. Sir John Kingman was identified by the directors as being independent on appointment.\n\n## H. Role of the non-executive directors\n\nThe non-executive directors' engagement with management, constructive challenge and contribution to Board discussion are assessed as part of the Board's annual effectiveness review. The non-executive directors' letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected from them. At times, this time commitment may go beyond that set out in the letter of appointment and is therefore reviewed regularly. External commitments, which may have an impact on existing time commitments, must be agreed in advance with the Chairman and approved by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee under its delegation from the Group Board. In addition, the policy for the identification and management of directors' conflicts of interest is reviewed on an annual basis. The significant commitments of each of the directors are included in the Board biographies on pages 58 to 59. The Chairman's commitments were considered as part of his appointment and the Board agreed that he had no commitments that were expected to have a negative impact upon his time commitment to the company. This is kept under review.\n\n## I. Role of the Company Secretary\n\nProcedures are in place to ensure that Board members receive accurate and timely information via a secure and electronic portal and all directors have access to the advice of the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary as well as independent professional advice at the expense of the company.\n\n## 3. Composition, succession and evaluation J. Appointments to the Board and succession planning\n\nThe Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for assessing the composition of the Board and, in making recommendations for appointments to the Board, the Committee considers the balance of skills, experience and knowledge needed in order to enhance the Board and support the company in the execution of its strategy. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for succession planning and leading the process of appointing new directors to the Board. Details of the work undertaken by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee are set out on pages 78 to 81.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board\n\nThe Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee is committed to ensuring that all appointments are made on merit having evaluated the capabilities of all potential candidates against the requirements of the",

Further details of the appointments undertaken during the year can be found on page 79 and a summary of the Board's policy on diversity and inclusion can be found on pages 80 to 81.\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nThe Board undergoes an externally facilitated evaluation every three years. An external Board evaluation was undertaken during 2020. Details of this external evaluation and an update on the progress against the recommendations from the 2019 externally-facilitated internal evaluation are set out on page 75. To ensure that the evaluation process is independent, robust and meaningful, the Board undertook a tender process for the evaluation provider in June, following which, the 2020 evaluation was facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation (IBE). Sir John Kingman's performance is appraised as part of this annual review, as well as the effectiveness of both the non-executives and the executive team.\n\nAll directors were subject to shareholder election or re-election at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and all directors received over 97% votes in favour of their re-election. All directors will be subject to shareholder election or re-election at the 2021 AGM, aside from Julia Wilson who reached her nine year tenure as non-executive director of the company in December 2020 and so will be stepping down from the Board on 31 March 2021.\n\n## 4. Audit, risk and internal control M. Internal and external audit\n\nThe Audit Committee comprises six independent non-executive directors and the Board delegates a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including oversight of the Group's financial reporting processes and internal control, and the work undertaken by the external and internal auditors. The Committee also supports the Board's consideration of the company's viability statement and its ability to operate as a going concern. The Audit Committee chair provides regular updates to the Board on key matters discussed by the Committee.\n\n## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe Strategic report, located on pages 1 to 55, sets out the performance of the company, the business model, strategy, and the risks and uncertainties relating to the company's future prospects. The 2020 Strategic Report includes a wide-ranging review and consideration of the impact of Covid-19 on both the Group and its stakeholders. When taken as a whole, the directors consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## O. Risk management and internal control framework\n\nThe Board sets the company's risk appetite and annually reviews the effectiveness of the company's risk management and internal control systems. A description of the principal risks facing the company is set out on pages\n\n44 to 47. Page 43 sets out how the directors have assessed the prospects of the company, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate (the 'viability statement'). The Group Risk Committee considers assessments of the Group's current risk profile and emerging risk factors, facilitated by the Group Chief Risk Officer. The activities of the Group Risk and Audit Committees are set out on pages 82 to 87.\n\n## 5. Remuneration\n\n## P. Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe company aims to reward employees fairly and its remuneration policy is designed to promote the long-term success of the company whilst aligning the interests of both the directors and shareholders. An updated remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. The directors' remuneration policy is set out on pages 94 to 95.\n\n## Q. Executive remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration for all executive directors. No director is involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.\n\n## R. Remuneration outcomes and independent judgement\n\nDetails of the composition and the work of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the Directors' report on remuneration on pages 88 to 113.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nA full version of the Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council's website.

Provided an individual had the relevant  skills, previous Board experience was  not a necessity. | As part of Board succession planning,  the Committee agreed in 2019 to  commence a recruitment process to  identify a suitable candidate for a new  non-executive director. After a tender  process, Spencer Stuart, an external  search consultant, was engaged to  facilitate the search and selection  process. | Search Potential candidates identified were  assessed against the role  specification, merit and with due  regard for the benefits of all forms  of diversity on the Board, including  gender and ethnicity. Candidates were  then shortlisted for interview.  Interviews focused on each candidate's  skills and experience for the role. | Following interview by the Chairman,  the Group Chief Executive and the  Group HR Director, a number of  candidates progressed to meet other  Board members. All were appropriate  for appointment based on their skills  and experience. Two of the candidates  indicated that they were keen to join  the Board and the Committee agreed  that those candidates should be  recommended to the Group Board for  appointment to the Board. The Board  approved the two appointments. Ric's |\n\nIn 2019 the Board undertook an assessment of the skills and competencies required for non-executive roles for the Board to effectively develop and oversee the Group's strategy and the identification of any gaps which could be filled to enhance the Board's future performance. The Committee determined that the company had a strong Board that was sufficiently able to manage the demands of the Group, but it would be useful to bolster the Board further in certain areas contemplated by the Group's five-year strategic plan. In addition, the Committee discussed that the Board would benefit from further diversity, including ethnic diversity. In 2020, the Board progressed these discussions and recruited two new non-executive directors, both of whom add valuable experience to the Board in financial services but also in sectors in which the company's exposure is increasing, such as real estate. The two new non-executive directors also add additional diversity to the Board. Further detail on our Group Board diversity is detailed in the charts on page 81.\n\nThe Board, as part of a continued focus on achieving best practice in governance, decided in 2020 to streamline executive representation on the Board to ensure there was always a substantial majority of independent non-executive\n\ndirectors. As such, from November 2020 only the Group CEO and Group CFO sit on the Board as executive directors. Kerrigan Procter, Chief Executive LGC, and Michelle Scrimgeour, Chief Executive LGIM, who were previously also executive directors of the Board, have continued in their executive roles.\n\nThe Committee has continued to focus on contingency, medium-term and long-term succession planning for the executive and senior management, with particular emphasis on leadership succession and capabilities evaluation. The Committee discussed in particular how the Executive Committee had worked together in response to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Following Committee discussions early in the year on executive succession, a number of changes were made to our executive team in September 2020, including the announcement of the appointment of Chris Knight as Chief Risk Officer and Andrew Kail, joining from PwC, as CEO of LGRR. In addition, later this year Laura Mason, currently Chief Executive, Legal & General Institutional Retirement (LGRI), will succeed Kerrigan Procter as Chief Executive, Legal & General Capital. Kerrigan Procter will be moving to a new role as President of Asia, Legal & General Group. We will run a formal recruitment process to identify Laura's successor as Chief Executive, LGRI. The Group aims for long integration periods for senior executive roles to ensure well-planned and appropriate handovers and this set of changes to the executive team will follow that planned long integration approach.",

        "page_content": "## Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report continued\n\nThe Committee also discussed succession planning for the Senior Independent Director (SID), a position currently held by Julia Wilson. Julia has served a nine-year term on the Board and so will step down on 31 March 2021. Philip Broadley, our Audit Committee chair, will take over from Julia as SID. Philip's four years of experience on the Board and as Audit Committee chair will position him well to fulfil the duties of SID. When considering Philip's appointment as SID, the Committee thought carefully about the time commitment required to undertake both this role, the role of Audit Committee Chair and his other external commitments. The Committee satisfied itself that Philip had sufficient time to fully commit to both roles.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for evaluating the independence of all non-executive directors and undertakes an annual review of each nonexecutive director's other interests. The Board, on the recommendation of the Committee, is satisfied that each non-executive director serving at the end of the year remains independent and continues to have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities to the company. As Julia Wilson has served on the Board for nine years, her continued independence was subject to a more rigorous review in 2020. Committee members considered Julia's external interests and other relationships which could materially interfere with her ability to exercise independent judgement. It was concluded that there were no circumstances which would affect Julia's ability to act in the best interest of the company and that her length of tenure had no detrimental impact on her level of independence.\n\nThe Committee is also responsible for overseeing and monitoring the Group's corporate governance framework which includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring the Group's compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n- \u00b7 Promoting the highest standards of corporate governance across the Group.\n- \u00b7 Considering and approving directors' additional external appointments, taking into account other demands on directors' time.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that on appointment to the Board, non-executive directors receive a formal letter of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of them in terms of time commitment, Committee service and involvement outside Board meetings.\n- \u00b7 Overseeing the process for ensuring that non-executive directors have tailored induction programmes on appointment and on-going development programmes, including regular Executive Business Awareness sessions, designed to maximise their effectiveness.\n\n- \u00b7 Overseeing the process by which the Board, each Committee and individual directors assess their effectiveness (including the use of an external facilitator periodically, as well as self-assessment) and report to the Board on the findings and recommendations.\n\nDetails of the Group's compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code have been provided on pages 76 to 77.\n\n## Our approach to diversity and inclusion\n\nOur ambition is to create an inclusive culture at Legal & General, where we can all perform at our best, no matter who we are. We believe not only that this is the right thing to do, but also that this aim is consistent with our objectives around inclusive capitalism. There is a clear commercial logic as well as a compelling moral case for this, and it underpins the actions we take to improve diversity and inclusion across the organisation.\n\n## 1. Building a diverse and inclusive Board\n\nAn effective Board is one that embodies diversity of thought and background, and one which reflects our people as well as the businesses and communities our organisation serves. Ensuring appropriate diversity in Board composition with the right mix of skills and experience has been a key focus for the Committee during the year.\n\nWe are committed to improving ethnic minority representation on our Board. Our appointment of Ric Lewis in 2020, and the arrival of Nilufer von Bismarck in May 2021, brings to the Board significantly greater diversity of ethnicity, in line with our Board Diversity Policy and the recommendations of the Parker Review.\n\nThe Board continues to support Lord Davies' and the Hampton-Alexander voluntary targets, namely for a third of all Board members in FTSE 350 companies to be women by 2020. As at 31 December 2020, our Board comprised 30% women and 70% men.\n\nWe are committed to increasing the number of women on our Board further and will address our current position as soon as possible. The chart on the following page demonstrates the Board's current position.\n\n## 2. Gender diversity and an inclusive Senior Leadership Team\n\nA diverse Senior Leadership Team is as important as a diverse Board, because we believe that executive decision-making is more effective if it takes into account a wider range of views and opinions. Therefore, we continue to hold ourselves to the stretching aspirational targets we set in 2017, to be achieved by the end of 2020:\n\n- 1.  50% female representation across our total population.\n- 2.  40% female representation at middle/senior management level.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, female representation across the group stood at 45% and at 35% at the middle/senior management level. Our Executive Committee comprises 27% women and 73% men, with two of our five operating businesses led by a female CEO.\n\nWhilst it is disappointing not to hit the targets we set ourselves, we continue to take practical and purposeful steps towards redressing imbalance, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing our inclusive hiring practices (such as balanced shortlists and diverse interview panels) and broadening our focus to allow us to address other areas of underrepresentation beyond gender.\n- \u00b7 Continued rollout of a digital, strengths-based assessment tool to reduce bias in talent management decisions.\n- \u00b7 Expansion of family-friendly, agile working practices.\n- \u00b7 Additional investment in training for line managers and leaders, helping them build new skills for leading inclusive teams where everyone can perform at their best.\n- \u00b7 Provision of wellbeing resources including access to a backup network for child, adult and elder care; and\n- \u00b7 Ongoing external validation and benchmarking through the Women in Finance Charter, the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and Hampton Alexander Review.\n\nIn 2020, we were awarded the Citywire Gender Diversity 'Judges choice' Award. This accolade was awarded for our stewardship work on gender diversity and leading position on ethnicity, as well as for the female representation in businesses at the board and executive levels and across other senior roles.\n\nFull gender data for our management teams and all employees is available on page 54.",

Broadening the diversity & inclusion agenda across our organisation\n\n2020 threw into sharp relief the need for continued focus, investment and action to address structural inequality and disadvantage within our organisations and across society. During the year, we spent time listening to our people, exploring external perspectives and reaffirming our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive business.\n\nTo reflect the importance of creating a diverse and inclusive business, at the end of 2020, we established our Global Diversity and Inclusion Council which reports to our Group Executive and Group Board, through the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. It is chaired by Laura Mason, CEO of our Institutional Retirement business and our Global Diversity and Inclusion Sponsor, and comprises senior leaders from across our divisions and geographies alongside Jeff Davies (Group CFO), Emma Hardaker-Jones (Group HR Director) and Michelle Scrimgeour (CEO, LGIM). The Council is tasked with defining and driving an ambitious agenda for D&I across the Group. It regularly reports to the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of our Group-wide diversity and inclusion policy. This policy applies to everyone directly employed by the Group and forms the basis of our engagement with our clients, suppliers and other third-party providers.\n\nOur standards include:\n\n- \u00b7 We will be fair and transparent, and treat our people with integrity and openness. We will be respectful of differences and we will not tolerate behaviour that marginalises, disadvantages or devalues others.\n- \u00b7 We will aim to build a workforce that reflects the diverse communities we serve. We will invest in our hiring processes so we can attract a more diverse pool of people, and we will tackle barriers that prevent us from attracting and retaining more diverse talent.\n- \u00b7 We will create an inclusive environment where people feel comfortable sharing their opinions and feel like they belong. We will encourage our people to embrace difference, to listen to other points of view, and work together to achieve the best outcome.\n- \u00b7 We will ensure that everyone across Legal & General understands their responsibilities in driving an inclusive and diverse culture and the opportunities it can bring. We will develop a clear governance framework and use data and insights to shape our actions, measure our progress, and drive accountability.\n\n## Diversity\n\nGender\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 the Board comprised:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30%\n\nWomen\n\n70%\n\nMen\n\n## Tenure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce [x] joins the Board in 2021\n\nthe Board will comprise: As at 31 December 2020 the length of tenure of the non-executives varies:\n\n36%\n\nWomen\n\n64% 20%\n\nMen\n\nOver six years\n\n50% Between three and six years\n\n30% Between zero and three years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethnicity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 the Board comprised individuals from the following ethnic groups:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10%\n\nBlack\n\n90%\n\nWhite\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 1 May 2021 the Board will comprise individuals from the following ethnic groups:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10%\n\nAsian\n\n10%\n\nBlack\n\n80%\n\nWhite\n\nThe Committee only engages executive search firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, which promotes gender diversity and best practice for corporate board searches. During the year, the company engaged Spencer Stuart, which is a signatory to this Code. This search firm has no other connection to the company or individual directors.\n\nThe Committee briefs the search firm to ensure that the pool of candidates presented includes a diverse range of candidates with an appropriate range of experience, knowledge and background, and who demonstrate independence of approach and thought.

The table below sets out its membership during the year.\n\n## Members\n\nPhilip Broadley\n\nHenrietta Baldock\n\nLesley Knox\n\nGeorge Lewis\n\nToby Strauss\n\nJulia Wilson\n\nOther regular attendees at Committee meetings include the following:\n\nGroup Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Chief Financial Officer; Group Chief Risk Officer; Director of Group Finance; Group Chief Internal Auditor; Legal & General Retirement Finance Director; Group Actuary; Chief Tax Officer; Representatives of the external auditor, KPMG LLP.\n\n## Letter from the Chairman Dear Shareholder\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2020. The report explains the work of the Committee during the year and meets the disclosure requirements set out in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code').\n\nThe Code requires that the Audit Committee must operate effectively and efficiently and that its members have a balance of skills and experience to deliver its responsibilities.\n\nThere were no changes to the membership of the Committee during the year. The members of the Audit Committee have a wide range of experience, including as executives in the financial services and other sectors, as non-executive directors, and as board members responsible for financial reporting. The Board considers that I meet the requirements of the Code in having recent and relevant financial experience, as do other members of the Committee.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that all members of the Committee are also members of the Risk Committee, which ensures that there is appropriate identification and management of any issues that are relevant to both committees.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with each of the external auditor and the Group Chief Internal Auditor. These meetings allow for regular and open dialogue of any issues relevant to the Committee's work. Audit Committee members also meet regularly with management outside of formal Committee meetings to discuss topical issues and maintain their understanding of the Group's businesses.\n\n## Audit Committee focus for 2020\n\nThe Audit Committee met five times in accordance with its annual plan and additional informal meetings were arranged as necessary. In line with its purpose, the Committee's time over the course of the year was spent in consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 Response to the outbreak of Covid-19 and the resilience of operational and financial controls in a remote working environment.\n- \u00b7 The integrity of the company's financial statements and Solvency II disclosures, including consideration of the viability statement and going concern assessments.\n- \u00b7 Key accounting, financial reporting and actuarial areas of judgement.\n- \u00b7 The adequacy and effectiveness of our systems of internal control, including whistleblowing; and\n- \u00b7 The effectiveness, performance and objectivity of both the internal and external audit functions including an externally facilitated review of the Group Internal Audit function.\n\nThe global outbreak of Covid-19 has had a profound impact on society. Quite rightly, the Committee has spent a large proportion of its time addressing the risks and issues the pandemic has caused our business. This has included work on understanding the impact of the pandemic on both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet, as well as the resilience of our control environment under remote working conditions. It is important that we continue to monitor all aspects of the control environment as we navigate our way through these unprecedented times. Additionally, as implementation draws closer, the Committee has continued to focus on the company's preparedness for IFRS 17. While our work has primarily remained in respect of ensuring plans are in place to meet the new financial reporting requirements, the focus has begun to shift to more detailed consideration of the modelling, methodologies and assumptions used to calculate insurance liabilities and the impact of transition, and we expect that increased focus to continue through this coming year.\n\n## Effectiveness reviews\n\nDuring the year, the Financial Reporting Council's Audit Quality Review Team ('AQRT') reviewed KPMG's audit of the Group's 2019 financial statements as part of their annual inspection of audit firms. The Audit Committee received and reviewed the final report from the AQRT, which indicated that there were no significant areas of concern.",

        "page_content": "In May the Committee received a report from PwC following an external quality assessment of the Group Internal Audit (GIA) function. As a Committee it is important for us to have an effective GIA function that we can place reliance on. PwC rated GIA as a mature and highperforming internal audit function, with excellent alignment to the business and a strong and embedded culture of ambition and continuous improvement. This external review confirmed the Committee's own assessment of the quality of GIA.\n\nThe Committee's performance was externally evaluated by Independent Board Evaluation in December 2020. The Committee identified two actions as part of its evaluation: undertaking a review of the Committee's composition to ensure that the Committee operated as efficiently and effectively as possible, and enhancing the Committee's engagement with both Group Internal Audit and KPMG.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Committee continues to operate effectively. Looking ahead to the coming year, Covid-19 continues to have a profound reach and impact, and I expect it to act as a key area of focus for the Committee, as it seeks to anticipate the pandemic's impact on controls, customers and critical accounting judgements.\n\nThe information on the following pages sets out in detail the activities of the Committee during the year. I hope that you will find this report useful in understanding our work and I welcome any comments from shareholders on my report.\n\nPhilip Broadley Chairman of the Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Audit Committee's terms of reference, which set out full details of its responsibilities, can be viewed on our website www.legalandgeneralgroup.com/ about-us/corporate-governance/\n\ngroup-board-committees/\n\n## How the Audit Committee spent its time in 2020\n\nThe Audit Committee is a Board Committee with governance responsibilities that include the oversight of financial disclosures and corporate reporting. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the following principal responsibilities to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities with regard to monitoring the integrity of the Group's financial statements, monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control (including financial internal control) framework and overseeing the independence and objectivity of the internal and external auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for advising the Board on whether the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and for reviewing the basis on which the Board provides the viability statement and going concern assessment.\n\nThese considerations have been factored into our year-end processes.\n\n## Percentage of time allocated to specific agenda items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 53% Accounting and financial reporting, including areas of judgement, and reporting developments\n- 12% External audit\n- 14% Internal audit\n- 14% Internal controls\n- 7% Other (including governance)\n\nThe Audit Committee has an annual work plan aligned with the financial reporting cycle of the company. The Audit Committee's activities fall into three principal areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting and financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Internal and external audit.\n- \u00b7 Internal control.\n\n## Accounting and financial reporting\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the appropriateness of the half year and annual financial statements, which it carries out with both management and the external auditors. This review includes ensuring that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable, as well as covering compliance with disclosure requirements and the material areas in which significant judgements had been applied.\n\nIn collaboration with the Risk Committee, the Audit Committee also reviews the disclosures to be made in relation to internal control and risk management, as well as the principal risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe significant accounting issues considered in relation to the 2020 financial statements are detailed on page 84.\n\nRobust year-end governance processes are in place to support the Audit Committee's considerations which include:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that all of those involved in the preparation of the company's annual report have been appropriately trained and fully briefed on the 'fair, balanced and understandable' requirements.\n- \u00b7 Internal legal verification of all factual statements, and descriptions used within the narrative.\n- \u00b7 Regular engagement with and feedback from senior management on proposed content and changes.\n- \u00b7 Feedback from external advisors (corporate reporting specialists, remuneration and strategic reporting advisors, external auditor) to enhance the quality of our reporting; and\n- \u00b7 Early opportunity for review and feedback on our annual report by Audit Committee members.\n\nAcross global markets and all areas of society, the Covid-19 outbreak has brought with it increased levels of both volatility and uncertainty. While Legal & General has been able to remain robust and resilient as an organisation through 2020, the pandemic has impacted areas of our business, as well as our employees and other key stakeholders in multiple ways. A key area of the Committee's focus has been on ensuring that the disclosures in the Group's half year financial statements and annual report and accounts appropriately reflect the impacts of Covid-19, as well as how the Group has responded to and mitigated those impacts, both financially and operationally.\n\nThe Audit Committee, having completed its review, recommended to the Board that, when taken as a whole, the 2020 annual report is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy. The Audit Committee, together with the Risk Committee, reviewed the key assumptions and methodologies of the risk-based capital model as well as related Solvency II disclosures.",

The Committee noted the extensive work that has been undertaken at an individual, team and organisational level to mitigate this risk and the positive impact that this work has had, evidenced through employee engagement scores.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Audit Committee monitored and reviewed the scope, extent and effectiveness of the activity of the Group internal audit function. In particular, the Audit Committee evaluates the alignment of the internal audit plan with the Group's key risks and strategy.\n\nThe Group Chief Internal Auditor has a standing agenda item at each Audit Committee meeting to update the Audit Committee on audit activities, progress of the audit plans, the results of any unsatisfactory audits and the action plans to address these areas. Despite the challenges that Covid-19 presented to the business, as well as the move to a remote working environment, Internal Audit were able to undertake all the audits within their Internal Audit Plan, including some additional reviews as a result of Covid-19, as approved by the Committee, completing 119 audits in 2020. There was a particular focus on key themes including: the effectiveness of the control framework in a remote working environment, cyber/data management and governance, financial control framework, digital business and regulatory change, conduct risk, financial management and control, model risk, outsourcing/vendor management and economic and political volatility.\n\n## The external auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and performance of the external auditor. This includes making recommendations for their appointment, re-appointment, removal and remuneration.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe Audit Committee is cognisant of the requirements governing the appointment of an external auditor, notably the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Uses of Competitive Tender Process and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, including requirements for mandatory audit firm rotation. The company confirms that it has complied with such requirements for the financial year under review.\n\nKPMG were appointed as the Group's external auditors with effect from the financial year ended 31 December 2018.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external auditor against the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Provision of timely and accurate industry specific and technical knowledge.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a professional and open dialogue with the Audit Committee Chair and members at all times.\n- \u00b7 Delivery of an efficient audit and the ability to meet objectives within the agreed timeframes.\n- \u00b7 The quality of its audit findings, management's response and stakeholder feedback.\n\nThe Audit Committee receives regular reports from the external auditor on audit findings and significant accounting issues. In 2020, the Audit Committee continued to focus on the external auditor's assurance work on the financial control environment, as well as their conclusions on the significant accounting issues noted above.\n\nThe move to remote working as a result of Covid-19, both for the Legal & General teams as well as those of KPMG, has created additional complexity for efficient and effective external audit work. The Committee has noted the flexing of audit approach and timetabling to address this additional complexity, and has confirmed with KPMG that they have been able to perform their audit with the same rigour, quality, and indeed efficiency, as would normally be expected.\n\nThe Chair of the Audit Committee regularly meets the external auditor throughout the course of the year. The Audit Committee also meets the external auditor in private throughout the year.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews and approves the terms of engagement of the external auditor and monitors its independence. This includes overseeing the engagement of the external auditors for non-audit work. The non-audit services policy prohibits the auditor from providing, amongst others, the following services:\n\n- \u00b7 Tax advice and compliance.\n- \u00b7 Management or decision making.\n- \u00b7 Book-keeping and preparing accounting records or statements.\n- \u00b7 Design or implementation of internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Valuation.\n- \u00b7 Legal, internal audit or human resources.\n- \u00b7 Those linked to financing capital structure or allocation or investment strategy.\n- \u00b7 Promoting, dealing in or underwriting share issues.\n- \u00b7 Payroll services.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nIn 2020, the group spent \u00a31.2 million on non-audit services provided by KPMG. It spent a further \u00a31.4 million on audit-related services required by legislation, which is excluded from any calculation of the ratio of non-audit to audit fees in accordance with the UK FRC Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors (2019). Further details can be found in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-audit fee represents 12% of the total audit fee for 2020. The audit fee for 2020 reflects an increase in fees for consolidated funds (which are not borne directly by the group), additional fees relating to the prior year audit of group subsidiaries, and incremental procedures relating to areas of audit focus in light of Covid-19.\n\n## Analysis of current and prior-year spend on audit, other assurance and non-assurance services\n\n|                                       | 2020   |   2019 |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Audit                                 | 10.1   |    7.1 |    6   |\n| Audit-related required by legislation | 1.4    |    0.8 |    0.8 |\n| Other audit-related                   | 0.6    |    1.1 |    0.6 |\n| Other assurance                       | 0.6    |    0.3 |    0.2 |\n| Non-assurance                         | -      |    0.2 |    1.5 |\n| Total                                 | 12.7   |    9.5 |    9.1 |\n\nThe policy is approved by the Audit Committee and met the requirements of the UK Ethical Standards.\n\nOur policy is to approach other firms for significant non-audit work. The Group's policy requires that all services with an anticipated cost in excess of a specified amount are subject to a full competitive tender involving at least one other alternate party in addition to the external auditor. If the external auditor is selected following the tender process, the Audit Committee is responsible for approving the\n\nexternal auditors' fees on the engagement. For services with an anticipated cost below the specified amount, the Group Chief Financial Officer has authority to approve the engagement. The external auditor and management are required to report regularly to the Audit Committee on the nature and fees relating to non-audit services provided under this authority.\n\nKPMG annually reports on whether and why it deems itself to be independent. The Audit Committee remains satisfied that KPMG continues to be independent.",

The table below sets out its membership during the year.\n\n## Members\n\nToby Strauss\n\nHenrietta Baldock\n\nPhilip Broadley\n\nLesley Knox\n\nGeorge Lewis\n\nRic Lewis\n\nJulia Wilson\n\nOther attendees at Committee meetings include: the Group Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Chief Financial Officer; Group Chief Risk Officer; Group Conduct Risk Director; Group Chief Internal Auditor; Chief Executive Officer LGC; Representatives of the external auditor, KPMG LLP.\n\nThe role of the Committee is to assist the Board in the oversight of the risks to which the Group may be exposed and to provide the Board with strategic advice in relation to current and potential future risk exposures. This includes reviewing the Group's risk profile and appetite for risk, and assessing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's approach to the management of risk is set out in more detail on pages 44 to 47.\n\nThe work of the Committee is supported by the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Company Secretary, who assists the Committee chair in planning the Committee's work and ensuring that the Committee receives accurate and timely information. The Committee met five times during 2020.\n\n## Group Chief Risk Officer's report\n\nThe Committee receives at each meeting a formal report from the Group Chief Risk Officer. This report brings to the Committee's attention key factors in the operating environment of the Group's businesses and an assessment of the potential risks that may emerge. The review includes analysis of risks arising from the macro-economic outlook and conditions in financial markets, together with geopolitical, legislative and regulatory change risks that may impact the Group's businesses, and risks associated with the implementation of the Group's business strategy.\n\nIn addition to the Group Chief Risk Officer's report, the Committee is provided with management information on risk appetite, comparing actual positions relative to the Group's risk appetite statement; and quantitative analysis of the Group's exposures to financial and operational risks, including risk-based capital requirements in relation to the core risks implicit in the Group's businesses.\n\n## Group Conduct Risk Director's report\n\nAt each meeting the Committee receives a report from the Group Conduct Risk Director. This provides the Committee with an assessment of the overall profile of conduct risks for the Group; analysis and trends in conduct risk indicators including complaints data, and the results of reviews undertaken by the group conduct risk monitoring team, as well as evaluation of changes in the conduct risk landscape as regulatory approaches evolve. The Group Conduct Risk Director's report is accompanied by a suite of customer service metrics designed to enable the Committee to assess the management of the customer journey across the Group's financial services products.\n\n## Assessing the risk impacts of Covid-19\n\nThe Committee has engaged extensively with executive and operational management over the course of the pandemic to consider the responses being taken to the range of risks presented by the disease, and the wider impacts for our businesses from the global lockdown.\n\nAs well as ensuring the wellbeing of those at Legal & General, the Committee has considered the actions taken to maintain the availability of customer facing services, and the resilience of supporting business activities.\n\nThe Committee has also considered assessments on the effects of the lockdown for the global economy and our investment portfolios, including the outlook for credit assets. Reviews of credit exposure have included sectors at risk from the global economic downturn and the longer-term impacts from changes in behaviours as a result of the pandemic. Trends in mortality for the Group's UK and US protection businesses, and offsetting effects with the Group's annuity portfolios have also been evaluated.",

The purpose of these reviews is to enable Committee members to examine the risk profile of the core business lines and to consider the robustness of the frameworks in place to manage the key risk exposures. Committee members are invited to participate in setting the agenda for these deep dive reviews, considering both the current operating environment and emerging risk factors. Below are examples of some of the key reviews that took place during 2020, and the areas of focus by the Committee.\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk management: Reviews of the Group's credit portfolio and its resilience to stressed market conditions.\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk management: Review of the nature of longevity risks within the Retirement businesses and the work of the longevity risk team to measure and price for the risk.\n- \u00b7 Responding to climate risk: Assessment of the approach and progress in responding to the risks of climate change and the delivery of policy commitments within the Group's TCFD.\n- \u00b7 The management of direct investments: Consideration of the credit and operational risks within the Group's portfolio of direct investments and the operation of the risk management and oversight framework.\n- \u00b7 Outsourcing and supply chain risks: Review of the Group's framework for oversight of third-party supply and service arrangements, the management of modern slavery risks within the supply chain, and key contract dependencies.\n- \u00b7 Protection claims management: The Group's approach to assessing and settling protection claims and ensuring balanced customer outcomes.\n- \u00b7 Building safety risks: Review of construction and asset ownership risks including the use of cladding materials.\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance counterparty risk: Evaluation of risks associated with reinsurance arrangements.\n- \u00b7 Operational resilience: Assessment of the Group's capabilities to ensure continuity of business operations and continued availability of important business services.\n- \u00b7 Transition from IBOR: Monitoring the Group's preparations for the transition to SONIA.\n\nThe Committee also takes an active role in the Group's recovery and resolution planning, which have been put in place in line with the UK regulatory requirements relating to systemically important insurers.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nAt its July meeting, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the operation of the Group's risk appetite framework and the key measures and tolerances used to determine acceptable risk taking, recommending some refinements to the Board. In December, the Committee considered the risk profile of the Group's strategic plan and its alignment with the Group's overall risk appetite.\n\nIn addition to this aggregate view of acceptable risk taking, the Committee also considers, as part of the Group's overall transaction approval process, the appetite for specific risks associated with transactions, particularly where the transaction is material in the quantum of risks being assumed or aspects of the transaction may present risks that are relatively new to the Group.\n\n## Risk-based capital model\n\nThe Group's risk-based capital model (internal model) is used to determine the capital requirements for the Group and forms the calculation engine for the Solvency II internal model. As well as reviewing and using the output of the model in its understanding of the Group's risk profile, the Committee is the focal point for model governance with specific consideration of the:\n\n- \u00b7 Key assumptions, methodologies and areas of expert judgement used within the model.\n- \u00b7 Activities undertaken to validate the outputs of the model.\n- \u00b7 Development of the model to ensure that it reflects the business lines and risk profile of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 Processes to ensure that changes applied in the model are undertaken in a controlled manner, and in line with model development plans.\n\n## Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)\n\nThe ORSA is an ongoing assessment of the risks to which Legal & General is exposed and an evaluation of the sufficiency of capital resources to sustain the business strategy over the plan horizon. Over the course of the year the Committee considered different aspects of the Group's ORSA process. This included the review of proposed stress tests and scenarios to be used in the evaluation of capital adequacy, the profile of risks within the Group's strategic plan and how they may change over the planning period, and the Group's overall capacity to bear the risks identified.\n\nA formal ORSA report is subject to annual review by the Committee prior to formal approval by the Group Board.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nSound frameworks of risk management and internal control are essential in the management of risks. During the year, the Committee has received updates on the continued development of the risk governance framework.\n\n## Risk-based remuneration\n\nThe Committee advises the Remuneration Committee on risk matters to be considered in reviewing bonus pools.",

Shortly after publishing our 2019 results and setting targets for 2020, the scale of the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 became clear and we reviewed our business plans, to prioritise the preservation of capital and shareholder funds due to the uncertain period ahead. This necessarily impacted planned growth in 2020 of some of our key metrics.\n\nAnnual variable pay In these unusual circumstances, our 2020 results demonstrated the resilience of our business model, with financial performance sustained at a level that enabled continued dividend payments. Legal & General operated throughout 2020 without accessing any furlough scheme or other Covid-19 business support and continued to pay Legal & General employees as normal. Nonetheless, the 2020 financial performance targets had assumed growth and that was not achieved. As a result there will be no bonus payments to executive directors based on Group financial performance for 2020, although some divisional financial performance targets were achieved.\n\n30% of the bonus opportunity for executive directors is based on strategic objectives, and the Committee carefully considered whether it was appropriate to pay any bonus based on the achievement of strategic objectives when Group\n\nfinancial performance targets had not been achieved. Reflecting on the necessary change in business focus during the year to protect stakeholders, and the progress of strategic objectives despite the impact of Covid-19, the Committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to exercise its discretion to prevent a bonus payout based on the achievement of these strategic objectives (strategic implementation, effective risk management and company culture). Consequently bonus payments to the executive directors in place at 31 December 2020, of 23.5% and 24.1% of maximum were permitted. A summary of the 2020 performance targets and outcomes is shown in the 'Quick read' section on page 93 with further details on pages 98 and 99.\n\nPerformance Share Plan The long-term incentive (PSP) awards granted in 2018 were subject to EPS and total shareholder return (TSR) performance over the three-year period ended 31 December 2020. Notwithstanding the change in priorities during 2020, the performance targets have not been adjusted, and the impact of 2020 has meant that the EPS threshold was not met. Legal & General outperformed the FTSE 100 and the TSR comparator group, and consequently, 24.2% of the 2018 PSP award will vest, with the remaining 75.8% forfeited. The shares that have vested will be deferred for a further two years and released in 2023. PSP performance targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 93.\n\nPSP awards are normally granted each year, subject to performance. Ordinarily the awards would have been granted to executive directors and other senior executives in April 2020.",

        "page_content": "However, due to market volatility as a result of Covid-19 and the consequent fall in share price at that time, the Remuneration Committee decided to postpone the grant to executive directors and other senior executives until the markets were more settled, and a decision regarding the quantum and terms of any grant could be more fully considered.\n\nThe PSP awards were subsequently granted on 12 August 2020 using an average share price of 229.26p. An additional provision was included in the terms of the grant, enabling the Remuneration Committee to reduce the number of shares vesting and/or impose further conditions on the award to neutralise any 'windfall gain' that might arise from a subsequent rebound in the share price as markets recover. As it is not possible to predict the extent of any 'windfall gain' that might arise, the Remuneration Committee determined that any adjustment would be made at the end of the three year performance period, taking into consideration all relevant factors at that time. There are many factors to be considered which include:\n\n- \u00b7 The share price at grant compared to the market before the impact of Covid-19 and the movement in share price of comparator organisations and key indices before and after grant.\n- \u00b7 The share price at vesting and any increase compared with comparator organisations and key indices over the same time period.\n- \u00b7 An assessment of any share price growth that may be attributable to an improvement in corporate performance, as opposed to general market movements.\n- \u00b7 The impact on performance conditions (EPS and TSR growth) and whether any unusual market conditions during the performance period made them materially easier or more difficult to achieve.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's report for 2023 will include a full description of the factors considered and the determination of any 'windfall gain' adjustment.\n\nBase pay increases In accordance with our remuneration policy, base pay is reviewed annually taking into account external and internal factors, including overall business performance. The Remuneration Committee have decided that no increases will apply for 2021, and therefore executive directors' base pay will remain unchanged.\n\n## Board changes\n\nIn June 2020, Ric Lewis joined the Group Board as an independent non-executive director and also as a member of this Committee. To streamline executive representation on the Group Board, Kerrigan Procter (CEO LGC) and\n\nMichelle Scrimgeour (CEO LGIM) stood down as executive directors on 26 November 2020. They continue in their executive roles, with the policies and practices applying to their remuneration unchanged. Remuneration reporting regulations require us to report their remuneration only while they were executive directors, but to ensure full transparency, their remuneration outcomes for the whole of 2020 are disclosed in this report as additional notes.\n\n## Consideration of the wider workforce\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference provide that they have regard to remuneration for all employees across the Group. The policies and practices applying to executive directors are the same as for the wider workforce in most instances, although quantum and participation may vary. During 2020, it was particularly important to protect employees against the health and financial impacts of Covid-19. All permanent UK employees have access to private medical insurance, emergency assistance when travelling on business, and a 24/7 employee assistance helpline.\n\nIn addition there are several wellbeing support packages, including Unmind (a confidential mental health app), emergency childcare and eldercare support. Employees were also given additional time off, and participated in charity and community events to support those impacted by Covid-19. As our workplaces began to close due to the government restrictions and employees started to work from home (where they could effectively do so) we maintained all employees' jobs at full pay, even if they were unable to work fully during this period due to caring responsibilities.\n\nIn 2020, the average annual base pay increase for UK employees was 3.6%. As in previous years, higher percentage increases were applied to the lower paid, reflecting their proportionally greater exposure to price inflation. The same approach has been adopted for 2021. Those earning less than \u00a330,000 a year may receive a base pay increase of up to 3.0%, but those earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year will generally not receive any base pay increase for 2021. Annual bonuses for employees are based on Group, divisional, and individual performance. Some bonuses will be paid to employees for 2020, in particular where individual performance targets were achieved.\n\nContinuing our support for all Legal & General employees, several new benefits were introduced during 2020, including an electric car scheme, a facility for employees to flex their life insurance, income protection and critical illness cover through a new product developed by Legal & General called 'Protect', and an extension of our wellbeing support packages to include family members of employees.\n\nAround two thirds of employees invest in the Share Purchase and ShareSave plans so that, through their employment, they can become shareholders in Legal & General. ShareSave has been offered by Legal & General for over 40 years, and we intend to continue to offer in 2021.\n\nThe decision to protect employees' pay, particularly the lower paid, during 2020 while executive director outcomes are much reduced, has resulted in a significant reduction in the CEO pay ratio from a median of 105:1 for 2019, to 41:1 for 2020. Continued focus on all employee opportunities has also produced a further improvement in our median gender pay gap for 2020, with the effect of recent senior female hires and promotions starting to be reflected in the results.\n\n## 2021 and beyond\n\nA new remuneration policy was presented for approval at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, and I am pleased that this received 95.7% votes in favour. The new policy means that executive directors' shareholding requirement has increased to 325% of base pay, with a requirement to maintain their shareholding for at least two years after leaving employment, and pension contributions will be aligned between executive directors and the majority of the UK workforce by 2022. The remuneration policy table is reproduced on pages 94 and 95 and the full remuneration policy can be found in the 2019 annual report and on the company website.\n\nFrom 2021, environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures have been included as targets in the Annual Variable Pay (AVP) plan, and will be considered for the vesting of Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nFor 2020, planned growth in some of our key metrics was not achieved. As a result, total remuneration for executive directors in place at 31 December 2020, is down by more than 50% compared to 2019. This reflects the geared remuneration structure for executive directors designed to reward performance and align with the experience of our shareholders. The Remuneration Committee will actively continue to review remuneration and consider shareholders' experience and views, to ensure that outcomes remain appropriate in all the circumstances. I trust that you will find this report a useful and clear account of the remuneration decisions and outcomes for the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lesley Knox\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee",

As a result, the PSP figures recognised in the 2019 annual report were based on a three-month average share price to 31 December 2019. The 2017 PSP figures reported in the 2019 single figure table above now reflect the actual vesting price of the shares, which vested on 6 March 2020, at \u00a32.414 per share. The figures in the 2019 report were \u00a32,193,000 (Nigel Wilson), \u00a31,206,000 (Jeff Davies) and \u00a31,146,000 (Kerrigan Procter).\n\n- 1.

The value includes both the cash element and the portion deferred into shares (50% of the award).\n\nThe executive directors' AVP awards in relation to performance during 2020 were agreed by the Committee in February 2020 and were measured against a basket of metrics and objectives. For Nigel Wilson and Jeff Davies, they were weighted between group financial objectives (70%) and other strategic personal objectives including effective risk management (30%). For Kerrigan Procter and Michelle Scrimgeour they were weighted between group financial objectives (20%), divisional objectives (50%) and other strategic personal objectives (30%).\n\nSince 2017, the AVP awards have been subject to potential adjustment based on an assessment of overall financial performance, risk and any other circumstances considered relevant by the Remuneration Committee as well as a Solvency II performance measure. For 2020, the Solvency II performance measure was assessed by the Committee on a qualitative assessment of performance informed by input from the Chief Risk Officer and the Risk Committee. Based on this assessment and consideration of all the circumstances, it was determined that no adjustment was necessary to the formulaic outcome.\n\nFor 2020, AVP payouts as a percentage of the maximum were: Nigel Wilson 23.5%, Jeff Davies 24.1%, Kerrigan Procter 28.4% and Michelle Scrimgeour 37.0%. The tables below illustrate performance against each of the measures.\n\n## Performance outcome (% of maximum)\n\nAVP award (\u00a3)\n\n| Executive director   | Group financial  (max 70%/20%)   | Divisional  financial  (max 50%)   |   Strategic  personal  (max 30%) |   Total   (max 100%) | Cash    | Deferred   | Total   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|---------|------------|---------|\n| N Wilson             | -                                | n/a                                |                             23.5 |                 23.5 | 172,850 | 172,850    | 345,700 |\n| J Davies             | -                                | n/a                                |                             24.1 |                 24.1 | 106,450 | 106,450    | 212,900 |\n| K Procter            | -                                | 5.9                                |                             22.5 |                 28.4 | 122,082 | 122,082    | 244,164 |\n| M Scrimgeour         | -                                | 13.0                               |                             24   |                 37   | 173,520 | 173,520    | 347,040 |\n\nIn these unusual circumstances, our 2020 results demonstrated the resilience of our business model, with financial performance sustained at a level that enabled continued dividend payments to shareholders. Legal & General operated throughout 2020 without accessing any furlough scheme or other Covid-19 business support and continued to pay Legal & General employees as normal. Nonetheless, the 2020 financial performance targets had assumed growth and that was not achieved. As a result executive directors will receive no bonus based on Group financial performance for 2020, although some divisional financial performance targets were achieved.\n\n30% of the bonus opportunity for executive directors is based on strategic objectives, and the Committee carefully considered whether it was appropriate to pay any bonus based on the achievement of strategic objectives when Group financial performance targets had not been achieved. Reflecting on the necessary change in business focus during the year to protect stakeholders, and the progress of strategic objectives despite the impact of Covid-19, the Committee concluded that it would be inappropriate to exercise its discretion to prevent a bonus payout based on the achievement of these strategic objectives (strategic implementation, effective risk management and company culture).\n\n## Group financial - achievement\n\n|                             | Weighting                 | Weighting   | Weighting        | Weighting           | 2020 performance   | 2020 performance   | 2020 performance   | 2020 performance   |                     |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Performance measures        | Nigel Wilson              | Jeff Davies | Kerrigan Procter | Michelle Scrimgeour | Threshold          | Target             | Maximum            | Actual             | Payout % of maximum |\n| Net release from operations | 20.00%                    | 20.00%      | 5.71%            | 5.71%               | 1,579              | 1,682              | 1,734              | 1,511              | 0%                  |\n| Operating profit 2, 3       | 25.00%                    | 25.00%      | 7.14%            | 7.14%               | 2,085              | 2,210              | 2,273              | 2,007              | 0%                  |\n| Adjusted EPS 2              | 12.50%                    | 12.50%      | 3.57%            | 3.57%               | 28.8               | 31.2               | 32.2               | 19.5               | 0%                  |\n| Adjusted ROE 2              | 12.50%                    | 12.50%      | 3.57%            | 3.57%               | 18.5               | 19.0               | 19.5               | 12.9               | 0%                  |\n| Solvency II performance 4   | Solvency II performance 4 |             |                  |                     |                    | Underpin           | Underpin           | Underpin           |                     |\n\n- 2.

Vesting will be based on performance as set out in the table below:\n\n| Vesting level                            | TSR                                    | EPS growth p.a.    |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 0%                                       | Below median                           | <5%                |\n| 15%                                      | Median                                 | 5%                 |\n| 100%                                     | 80th percentile and above              | 12%                |\n| Straight line basis between 15% and 100% | Between median and the 80th percentile | Between 5% and 12% |\n\nOrdinarily, share awards are granted in April of each year, following announcement of the company's annual results. Due to market volatility in April 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Remuneration Committee agreed to defer the grant of share awards to executive directors and Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibility (PDMR) until markets had become more settled. The share awards were subsequently granted on 12 August 2020 based on the average share price at the time of grant. For the PSP awards this was based on the average share price for the five days preceding the grant date and for the deferred bonus SBP awards this was based on the average share price for the three days preceding the grant date. In both cases the share price at grant was higher than if the grant had been made in April 2020 as originally intended. The PSP awards were granted with an additional provision that the Remuneration Committee may amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting) to ensure there are no 'windfall gains' as a result of a low share price due to market volatility at the time of grant. The PSP awards granted do not attract dividend equivalents during the vesting period.\n\nAt the end of the three-year performance period commencing 1 January 2020, the Committee will critically assess whether the formulaic vesting outcome is justified. To do this, the Committee will look at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of underlying performance and has been achieved within the company's agreed risk appetite, the Solvency II coverage ratio, the quality of earnings and the nature of any changes in leverage or key assumptions. If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting schedule is not felt to be justified, then the Committee can exercise downwards discretion. The Remuneration Committee may also consider reducing the number of shares vesting and/or impose further conditions on the award to neutralise any 'windfall gain' that might arise.",

They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependant child under the age of 18 years.\n\nAlthough the share ownership guidelines are not contractually binding, executive directors are normally expected to retain any after tax vested share awards until the guideline is met. The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the PSP if executives are not making satisfactory progress against the guidelines. Once shareholding requirements have been met, executive directors may sell surplus shares if they wish. The Committee has discretion to allow executive directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding guidelines being met if there are extenuating circumstances, for example, changes to personal circumstances.\n\nFrom 2020 all executive directors will also be required to maintain this level of shareholding for two years post-cessation of their employment.\n\n## Share options exercised during 2020\n\nThe following table shows all share options exercised by the executive directors during 2020.\n\n| Executive director   | Date of grant   | Shares exercised   | Exercise date   |   Share price at   date of exercise \u00a3 | Gain \u00a3   |\n|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|----------|\n| Nigel Wilson         | 14/04/2015      | 170,045            | 19/04/2020      |                                 2.054 | 349,272  |\n| Nigel Wilson         | 21/04/2016      | 158,009            | 19/04/2020      |                                 2.054 | 324,550  |\n| Nigel Wilson         | 18/04/2017      | 265,173            | 19/04/2020      |                                 2.054 | 544,665  |\n| Jeff Davies          | 18/04/2017      | 145,859            | 09/03/2020      |                                 2.18  | 317,973  |\n| Jeff Davies          | 07/04/2017      | 1,791              | 22/06/2020      |                                 2.205 | 349      |\n| Kerrigan Procter     | 14/04/2015      | 44,844             | 17/12/2020      |                                 2.587 | 116,011  |\n| Kerrigan Procter     | 21/04/2016      | 53,501             | 17/12/2020      |                                 2.587 | 138,407  |\n| Kerrigan Procter     | 18/04/2017      | 138,566            | 17/12/2020      |                                 2.587 | 358,470  |\n\n## Non-executive directors' remuneration - 2020\n\n## Non-executive directors' fees\n\nThe fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors were reviewed during 2020 and with effect from 1 August 2020 the fee for the Chairman was increased from \u00a3505,000 to \u00a3523,000.

Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the Group's sector and the markets in which the divisions operate. The policy for the majority of employees continues to be to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.\n\nWe define core remuneration as base pay, annual bonus and other benefits such as pension.

Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay audit that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working. In addition, it considers the application of the pay policy more widely, in particular looking at decisions made in the annual pay review across grades, functions and divisions.\n\n## Gender pay reporting\n\nThe Group has published its gender pay report for 2020. Further details can also be found on page 54 of the annual report.\n\n## Pay ratio in relation to the Group CEO\n\nSince 2016 we have voluntarily disclosed details of the pay ratio in relation to the Group CEO and the wider UK employee population.

The decrease is the result of the lower bonus and lower level of vesting of the 2018 PSP compared with the PSP awards in the previous three years.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe have chosen option B as our method for calculating the pay ratio for 2020, consistent with the methodology for reporting of the gender pay gap. The total remuneration figures for the UK employees are based on salaries at 1 December 2020. Bonus amounts for 2020 are not determined for some eligible employees until after publication of this report, and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact 2020 total remuneration for all UK employees (option A) within this timescale. For completeness and transparency, we have included the pay ratios based on the option A method for previous years and we will also retrospectively disclose the pay ratio for 2020 based on the option A method in the 2021 report. We do not believe that this will result in pay ratio figures which are materially different to the 2020 figures disclosed above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender Pay Gap Report\n\nOur 2020 gender pay gap report is available on our group website.

The increase in fees for non-executive directors of the Group is a result of the change in the fee structure in relation to committee memberships. The base fee for non-executive directors has  not changed from 2019.\n\nAs with last year we have chosen the whole UK employee population as the comparator group. This group has been chosen because it includes a wider cross section of the Group's employees. The increase in benefits for the employee comparator group relates to the impact of base pay increases.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe chart opposite shows the relative importance of spend on pay compared to shareholder dividends and operating profit for the year. Operating profit has been shown because it is a KPI of the business. No share buybacks were made in 2019 or 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from the Deloitte LLP engagement team is objective and independent. Deloitte are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The total fees paid to Deloitte in relation to Remuneration Committee work during 2020 were \u00a3105,600 (excluding VAT). While fee estimates are required for bespoke pieces of work, fees are generally charged based on time with hourly rates in line with the level of expertise and seniority of the adviser concerned. During the year, Deloitte also provided the company with consulting services.",

The remit of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy framework for the whole company as well as the executive directors.\n\nThe Committee particularly focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the individual remuneration for executive directors and for other designated individuals or for those who are discharging a head of control function role.\n- \u00b7 Undertaking direct oversight on the remuneration of other high earners in the Group.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of the remuneration of Code staff and employees in the control and oversight functions.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of remuneration policies and structures for all employees.\n\n## Considering risk\n\nThe Reward Steering Committee (RSC) and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the Group.\n\n## Reward Steering Committee (RSC)\n\nReporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which our incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the Group's risk appetite. The members of the RSC include the Group HR Director, Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Group Conduct Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Chief Compliance Officer, the Director of Group Finance, the Group Reward Director and the Head of Executive Compensation.\n\nWhere a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer all questions and challenges from the RSC.\n\n## Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also works closely with the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function with respect to remuneration proposals.\n\nIn particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, there have been regulatory breaches, or they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact the payment of bonuses to staff (including in particular the executive directors and Code staff).\n\nThe CRO also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the Group and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the Group's accepted risk appetite. The CRO also reviews the executive directors' objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.\n\nSince the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the CRO report has been extended to consider whether there are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nThe Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the Group's executive pay arrangements.\n\nDuring 2019, we reviewed our approach to remuneration in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice, and sought feedback from shareholders and representative bodies. The responses that we received helped shape our thinking with respect to the new remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM in May 2020. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 restrictions we had to change the format of the 2020 AGM but we have continued to engage with shareholders throughout the year and were able to hold a virtual shareholder event in December 2020.\n\nDuring 2021 the Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy and will consult with the Group's largest shareholders on any changes.",

The longevity, expense and credit risk assumptions involve the greatest level of subjectivity. A small change in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the liabilities. We consider the risk to have increased in the current year due to the higher degree of estimation uncertainty resulting from changes in both demographic and economic conditions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19).\n\n## Longevity assumptions\n\nLongevity assumptions have two main components which include mortality base assumptions and the rate of mortality improvements. Changing trends in longevity and emerging medical trends means that there is a high level of uncertainty in the assumptions. This uncertainty is heightened in the current year due to the potential longer-term impacts of Covid-19 on trends in longevity.\n\n## Credit assumptions\n\nThe valuation discount rate (Valuation Interest Rate, 'VIR') is derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liabilities. In setting the valuation interest rate, an explicit allowance for credit risk is deducted from the yield on debt and other fixed income securities.\n\nThe assumptions surrounding this deduction require significant judgement and there is a risk that changes in investment yields, market spreads, current actual default experience and anticipated trends are not appropriately reflected. This risk is heightened in the current year due to the potential impact of Covid-19 on the credit risk within the group's investments.\n\n## Expense assumptions\n\nManagement judgement is required in setting the maintenance expense assumption which is based on management's long-term view of the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies.\n\n## Data capture:\n\nThere is a risk that incomplete and inaccurate data is used in the calculation of annuity liabilities resulting from inaccurate transfer or conversion of aggregate data from the policy administration systems into model point files used to value the liabilities in the actuarial models. In addition there is a risk that incomplete or inaccurate asset data is used to calculate the default adjustment applied to the VIR.\n\n## Calculation error:\n\nManagement uses actuarial models to calculate policyholder liabilities. There is a risk that unauthorised or erroneous changes to the models may occur.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of insurance contract liabilities has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements disclose the sensitivities (Note 20) estimated by the group.\n\n- Our procedures included:\n- -Control design and operation: testing of reconciliation controls to assess completeness of data flows from policy administration systems to the actuarial valuation models.\n- -Test of detail: testing the completeness of data used in the valuation of annuity liabilities by reconciling the data from the policy administration system to the data used in the actuarial models.\n- -Test of detail: By utilising data and analytics procedures, testing the accuracy of the historical data input into the actuarial valuation model by comparing the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2020 to the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2019 in relation to policies that were still in force at that time;\n- -Test of detail: Tracing a sample of new business policyholder data input into the actuarial valuation model to the underlying policy documents;\n- -Test of detail: Reconciling the completeness and accuracy of the assets used in the calculation of the VIR to the assets used to back the insurance liabilities; and\n- -Test of detail: For a sample of assets, validating the accuracy of the asset data used to project the cash flows used in the calculation of the VIR.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our procedures in this area. Our procedures included:\n\n- -Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the methodology for selecting assumptions by applying our understanding of developments in the business and expectations derived from market experience, including consideration of the effects of Covid-19 on policyholder mortality and credit risk.\n- -Benchmarking assumptions: assessing mortality improvement assumptions against industry data on expected future mortality rate improvements and industry historic mortality improvement rates and assessing the appropriateness of the credit risk assumptions by comparing to industry practice and our expectations derived from market experience.\n- -Historical comparisons: evaluating the mortality base assumptions used in the valuation of the annuity liabilities by comparing to the group's historic mortality experience; assessing the credit default assumptions by comparing to the historical performance of the asset portfolio; and assessing whether the expense assumptions reflect the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies by analysing the allocations of the forecast 2021 costs to maintenance expenses, with reference to historical allocations and planned actions.\n- -Test of detail: testing that changes to the actuarial model from the prior year have been appropriately reviewed and approved; and evaluating the appropriateness of the financial impact of the changes made to the model during the year.\n- -Assessing transparency: considering whether the disclosures in relation to the assumptions used in the calculation of valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements and appropriately represent the sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative scenarios and inputs.\n\n## Our results\n\n- -We found the resulting estimate of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities within non-participating insurance contract liabilities to be acceptable (2019 result: acceptable).",

This subjectivity is heightened in the current year due to the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on asset valuations. For these positions a reliable third party price from a recent market transaction was not readily available and therefore the application of expert judgement from\n\nmanagement in the valuations adopted is required.\n\nThe key assumptions underlying the valuations are:\n\n- -Lifetime mortgages: property price at valuation date, property price inflation, property index volatility, voluntary early redemption rate and the illiquidity premium added to the risk free rate.\n- -Private credit: yields of selected comparator securities and credit ratings derived from credit rating models.\n- -Investment property and income strips: estimated rental value and yield of the property.\n\n## Data capture:\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nThere is a risk that incomplete data is used in the calculation of lifetime mortgages because data does not transfer appropriately from the policyholder system to the actuarial models.\n\n## Calculation error:\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nThe group uses complex actuarial models to calculate the valuation of lifetime mortgages. There is a risk that unauthorised or erroneous changes to the models may occur.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (Note 11) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the group.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- -Control design and operation: testing of the design, and implementation of key controls over the valuation process for the hard to value (Level 3) investments, including the testing of operating effectiveness of key controls relating to the valuation of private credit assets and lifetime mortgages.\n- -Our valuation expertise:\n- -using valuation specialists to assess the suitability of the valuation and credit rating methodologies;

This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to total assets to reflect that the parent company is a component of the group, and represents 0.23% of the Company's total assets (2019: 0.26%).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality for the group and parent company was set at 65% (2019: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a370.0 million (2019: \u00a380.0 million) and \u00a318.9 million (2019: \u00a321.8 million) respectively.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the increased estimation uncertainty in relation to credit risk and mortality trends due to Covid-19 and the level of identified immaterial unadjusted differences and control deficiencies noted during prior periods.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a35.4 million (2019: \u00a35.3 million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nIn addition, we applied materiality of \u00a34.2 billion (2019: \u00a33.6 billion) to the classification of unit-linked assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and related notes, determined with reference to a benchmark of total financial investments and investment property, of which it represents 1.0% (2019: 0.9%). This materiality was applied solely for our work on matters for which a misstatement is likely only to lead to a reclassification between line items within assets and liabilities, in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit of Insurers in the United Kingdom.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected classification misstatements in unit-linked assets and liabilities exceeding \u00a3208.0 million (2019: \u00a3181.0 million).\n\nOf the group's audit components, we subjected 7 (2019: 7), which are purposes and 4 (2019: 4), which are comprised of 7 reporting packs\n\ncomprised of 13 reporting packs (2019: 14), to full scope audits for group (2019: 7), to specified risk-focused audit procedures over financial\n\ninvestments, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, payables and financial liabilities. The components for which we performed specified risk-focused procedures were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages above.\n\nFor the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. The group team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised profit before tax from continuing operations.\n\n## PBTCO\n\n(normalised) \u00a32,218m (2019: \u00a32,275m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Materiality\n\n\u00a3108.0m ( 2 0 19 : \u00a3 107.0 m)\n\n## \u00a3108.0m (2019: \u00a3107.0m)\n\nWhole financial statements materiality\n\n## \u00a370.0m (2019: \u00a380.0m)\n\nWhole financial statements performance materiality\n\n## \u00a370.0m (2019: \u00a370.0m)\n\nRange of materiality at 11 components (\u00a35.4m-\u00a370.0m) (2019: \u00a35.3m-\u00a370.0m)\n\n## \u00a35.4m (2019: \u00a35.3m)\n\nMisstatements reported to the Audit Committee\n\nGroup profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull scope for group audit purposes 2020\n\nSpecified risk-focused audit procedures 2020\n\nResidual components\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u00a35.4 million to \u00a370.0 million (2019: \u00a35.3 million to \u00a370.0 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the group across the components.\n\nWhilst we were unable to perform site visits due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, the group team held video and telephone conference meetings with 11 (2019: 11) component locations in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and the United States (2019: United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and the United States), to assess the audit risk and strategy. At these meetings, the findings reported to the group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group team was then performed by the component auditor.\n\nThe work on 9 of the 11 components (2019: 9 of the 11 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, was performed by the group team.\n\n## 4 Going concern\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group's and the company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the group and company, its industry, and the general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the group and company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely affect the group's and company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7 Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic environment including, but not limited to, wider credit spreads and defaults which affect regulatory capital solvency coverage ratios, liquidity ratios, the valuations of the group's investments and valuation of policyholder liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the failure of counterparties who have transactions with the group (such as banks and reinsurers), which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources by the group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u00b7 We consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- We have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's or company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.\n- \u00b7 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the group and company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 249 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group or the company will continue in operation.",

Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit, Group Financial Crime team and inspection of policy documentation as to the group's/ company's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- \u00b7 Reading board, Audit Committee and Risk Committee meeting minutes.\n- \u00b7 Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management; and\n- \u00b7 Consulting with professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the group.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements such as the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities and the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments.\n\nOn this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because there is limited management judgement involved in the valuation and recognition of all material revenue streams.\n\nWe also identified fraud risks related to the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments in response to possible pressures to meet profit targets.\n\nFurther detail in respect of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments is set out in the two key audit matters disclosures in section 2 of this report.\n\nWe also performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying journal entries to test for full-scope components, based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included, but were not limited to, journals impacting cash balances that were identified as unusual or unexpected in our risk assessment procedures.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions; and\n- \u00b7 Aassessing significant accounting estimates for bias.",

        "page_content": "## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to full scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the group's licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: Listing rules, regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the group's activities and certain regulated subsidiaries. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' confirmation within the Group Board viability statement on page 43 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity.\n- \u00b7 The Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u00b7 The directors' explanation in the Group Board viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Group Board viability statement, set out on page 43 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation\n\nLegal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, operates across four broad business areas of retirement, investment management, capital investment and insurance through its subsidiaries and associates in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States and other countries throughout the world.\n\n## (i) Significant accounting policies\n\nThe group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU), and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The group financial statements also comply with interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB and as adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 , enacted in UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 , an implementation period had been established, which ended on 'IP completion day', defined as 31 December 2020 at 11.00 p.m. UK time. Reporting in the UK continues to be subject to the EU legislative framework until 31 December 2020. From 1 January 2021, the group will prepare financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. A new UK endorsement mechanism, overseen by the Secretary of State, is being put in place and to this aim a UK Endorsement Board is currently in the process of being established.\n\nThe group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, availablefor-sale financial assets, financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated. Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis. Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.\n\n## (ii) Going concern\n\nThe group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position in the current economic climate are set out in this Annual Report & Accounts. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in these consolidated financial statements. Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 44 to 47.\n\nThe directors have made an assessment of the group's going concern, considering both the group's current performance and the group's outlook for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, which takes account of the current and future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, using the information available up to the date of issue of this Annual Report & Accounts.\n\nThe group manages and monitors its capital and liquidity, and various stresses are applied to those positions to understand potential impacts from market downturns. Our key sensitivities and the impacts on our capital position from a range of stresses is disclosed in section 5.01 of the Full year report 2020. These stresses, including the additional considerations and stresses applied in response to Covid-19, do not give rise to any material uncertainties over the ability of the group to continue as a going concern. Based upon the available information, the directors consider that the group has the plans and resources to manage its business risks successfully and that it remains financially strong and well diversified.\n\nHaving reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties (both financial and operational) in light of Covid-19 and the current economic climate, as detailed on pages 44 to 47, the directors are confident that the group and Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\n## (iii) New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the group\n\nThe group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2020.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nThese amendments, issued in October 2018, provide more guidance on the definition of a business. These amendments did not have any material impact on the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: 'Definition of Material'\n\nThese amendments, issued in October 2018, clarify the definition of 'material', and align the definition used in the Conceptual Framework and the standards themselves. These amendments did not have any material impact on the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards\n\nThese amendments, issued in March 2018, update the current conceptual framework with the aim to assist preparers of financial reports to develop consistent accounting policies for transactions. These amendments did not have any material impact on the group's consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures: 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform'\n\nThese amendments were issued in September 2019. They modify some specific hedge accounting requirements to provide relief from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform. These amendments did not have any material impact on the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases: 'Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions'\n\nThe amendment, issued in May 2020, provides an optional practical expedient for lessees from assessing whether a rent concession related to Covid-19 is a lease modification. Lessees can elect to account for such rent concessions in the same way as they would if they were not lease modifications. This amendment did not have any material impact on the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (iv) Changes in accounting policy\n\n## Legal & General Insurance America (LGIA) universal life and annuity liabilities\n\nDuring the year, the group has changed its accounting policy for universal life and annuity liabilities on business transacted by its US subsidiaries, which was previously based on recognised actuarial methods reflecting US GAAP. From 1 July 2020, the group has calculated such liabilities on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method, which is in line with how similar products are accounted for in other parts of the business.\n\nThe group believes the new policy is preferable as it more closely aligns the accounting for this business with that of business written in the UK, and brings it closer to the principles introduced by the upcoming new accounting standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 17. Following the change, the group no longer has any long-term business accounted for based on actuarial methods reflecting US GAAP, therefore resulting in the financial statements providing more reliable and relevant information about the impact of long-term business on the group's financial position, financial performance or cash flows, in line with IFRS requirements.\n\nIn addition to the change highlighted above, as at 1 July 2020 the group has reclassified \u00a31,621m of financial investments from designated as availablefor-sale and amortised cost to designated as fair value through profit or loss. This represents a further change in accounting policy permitted by IFRS 4, 'Insurance Contracts'.\n\nThe above represent voluntary changes in accounting policy and have been applied retrospectively, with prior year retained earnings adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe principal impact of the change on the prior year consolidated financial statements is in the non-participating insurance contract liabilities and in the deferred acquisition costs balance, which has been derecognised, and the associated cash flows now recognised within the insurance contract liability calculation. The carrying value of financial investments has also been affected where the measurement model for such investments has moved from amortised cost to fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe impact on each line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2019 is shown in the table below:\n\n|                                                  | As reported at 31 December 2019 \u00a3m   | Adjustments \u00a3m   | As restated at  31 December 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Financial investments                            | 498,376                              | 13               | 498,389                               |\n| Deferred acquisition costs                       | 75                                   | (21)             | 54                                    |\n| Reinsurers' share of contract liabilities        | 5,810                                | 137              | 5,947                                 |\n| Non-participating insurance contract liabilities | 77,317                               | 564              | 77,881                                |\n| Overseas deferred tax liability                  | 182                                  | (106)            | 76                                    |\n| Capital redemption and other reserves            | 250                                  | (45)             | 205                                   |\n| Retained earnings                                | 8,033                                | (284)            | 7,749                                 |",

The standard is expected to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. This reflects a two year delay to the original 2017 timetable confirmed by the IASB in their June 2020 amendments and remains subject to endorsement for use in the UK. The standard will be applied retrospectively, subject to the transitional options provided for in the standard, and provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their measurement, income statement presentation and disclosure. The group has mobilised a project to assess the financial and operational implications of the standard, and work will continue throughout 2021 to ensure technical compliance and to develop the required systems and operational capability to implement the standard.\n\n## IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments\n\nIn July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard replaces IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. It includes new principles around classification and measurement of financial instruments, introduces an impairment model based on expected credit losses (replacing the current model based on incurred losses) and new requirements on hedge accounting. The IASB subsequently issued 'Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts' which allows entities which meet certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17 or 1 January 2021, whichever is the earlier. In June 2020 the IASB agreed to extend the temporary exemption in IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The group qualifies for, and is making use of, this deferral option. The group has mobilised a project to assess the impact of IFRS 9 on its financial instruments, and work will continue in 2021 to develop the policies and operational changes needed for the implementation of the standard, with a focus on the development of the expected credit losses impairment model and transitional requirements.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n\nThese amendments, issued in August 2020, address issues that might affect financial reporting after the reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, make minor amendments to IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of IFRS', IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IAS 41 'Agriculture' and the Illustrative Examples accompanying IFRS 16 'Leases'. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, specify which costs a company includes when assessing whether a contract will be loss-making. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, update a reference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nThese amendments, issued in January 2020, clarify the existing requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.",

        "page_content": "## (vi) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, material adjustments could be made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements associated with and the application of significant accounting policies. The significant accounting matters considered by the Audit Committee are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 82.\n\nThe major areas of critical accounting judgement on policy application are considered below:\n\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 21 and 22): Product classification and the assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the group in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract.\n\nContracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the group are classified as insurance contracts. Contracts that transfer financial risk (e.g. change in interest rate or security price) to the group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nJudgement is required in order to assess the significance of the transfer of insurance risk within a contract. This assessment is based on whether the occurrence of an insured event could cause the group to make significant additional payments, i.e. if the occurrence of the event causes significantly higher cash outflows for the group than its non-occurrence.\n\nCertain contracts, which are both insurance and investment, contain discretionary participating features representing the contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits under certain conditions, being:\n\n- \u00b7 That the additional benefits are a significant portion of the total contractual benefits.\n- \u00b7 The amount and timing of the additional benefits is at the discretion of the group; and\n- \u00b7 That the additional benefits are contractually dependent upon the performance of a company, fund or specified pool of assets.\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with such discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 4, while investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39.\n\nJudgement is therefore required in order to establish whether any additional benefits in an insurance or investment contract meet the above requirements for being considered discretionary participation features.\n\n## Consolidation (Notes 45 to 47): Assessment of whether the group controls underlying entities and should therefore consolidate them.\n\nThe assessment takes account of various criteria, including decision making ability, equity holding and the rights to a variable return from the entity. Control arises when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nFor operating entities this generally accompanies a shareholding of 50% or more in the entity. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital (structured entities), are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe group invests in various fund and unit trust entities where it also acts as the asset manager to those entities. In these instances, in determining whether the group controls the entities, the assessment focuses on the aggregate economic interests of the group (direct interest and expected management fees) and on whether the group acts as a principal or agent. This includes an assessment of the removal rights of other investors (their practical ability to allow the group not to control the fund). Additionally, holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the group and other investors in them. As a result, in determining control, we look at an assessment of these factors over a longer period to mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the group's involvement. This is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50%, the group is judged to have control over the entity.\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 50%, the facts and circumstances of the group's involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the group has control over the entity; and\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the group is judged to not have control over the entity, but again the facts and circumstances of the group's involvement in the entity are considered.",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation continued\n\n## (vi) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued\n\nThe following sets out information about the critical accounting assumptions made by the group about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n## Valuation of insurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 19 to 22)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities; the assumptions for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the group's internal experience and judgements about how experience may vary in the future. This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the expense assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance liabilities that represent the expected future costs of administering the underlying insurance policies; the expense assumptions are based on management's best estimate of these future costs.\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default of the backing assets; these assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic internal data. The valuation interest rate is also sensitive to the selection of assets chosen to back the liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the target long-term asset portfolio at certain period ends, depending on the quantum and timing of pension risk transfer (PRT) volumes; this assumption is used to present LGR's new business metrics.\n\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities are of a long-term nature, and as such the ultimate impact of Covid-19 will emerge over a long period of time. As at FY20, there was insufficient certainty to revise long-term assumptions in response to emerging claims experience relating to the effects of the pandemic, with the exception of certain short-term allowances in protection contracts, which have been made to account for the higher mortality expected in 2021.\n\n## Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property (Note 11)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment property involves judgements in model valuations, through the incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, which include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible valuations for financial assets.\n\nDuring 2020, Covid-19 increased the volatility within asset markets, and this has driven an increased focus on the valuation of these assets. Given the diversity of our asset portfolio, the impact has been varied with certain asset classes and market sectors more exposed to the impact of Covid-19 than others. In assessing asset valuation, in line with applicable standards and guidance, the group has both projected the short-term impact on earnings and cash flows of the current market volatility, while continuing to review the assets' ability to deliver longer-term returns aligned to their investment cases.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plan (Note 24)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of pension plan assumptions including mortality, discount rates and inflation; these assumptions have been set in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits' and include consistent judgements with those in setting the annuity liabilities where possible. Note 24 includes a sensitivity analysis to alternative assumptions.\n\n## (vii) Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiary undertakings\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the group directly or indirectly has control (i.e. when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee) (Note 45). Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control. Puttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nThe group has interests in associates and joint ventures (Note 46) which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities. In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, 'Investments in associates', these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nAssociates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost. The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the group's share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition.",

The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 21 and 22 respectively. Following the sale of the Mature Savings business, the group no longer has any participating insurance or investment contracts. The following table summarises the classification of the group's significant types of non-participating insurance and investment contracts as described in Note 6 for each applicable reportable segment.\n\n| Reportable segment   | Non-participating insurance contracts                                                                             | Non-participating investment contracts                                                                                       |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LGR                  | \u00b7  Pension risk transfers \u00b7  Individual annuities \u00b7  Longevity insurance \u00b7  Lifetime Care Plan                    | \u00b7  Lifetime mortgages \u00b7  Fixed term individual annuities \u00b7  Assured payment policies \u00b7  Retirement interest only mortgages   |\n| LGI                  | \u00b7  UK Retail protection  \u00b7  UK Group protection \u00b7  US Protection \u00b7  US Universal life  \u00b7  US Individual annuities |                                                                                                                              |\n| LGIM                 |                                                                                                                   | \u00b7  Workplace savings  \u00b7  Institutional pension \u00b7  Segregated investment management mandates \u00b7  Collective investment schemes |\n\n## (ix) Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements. Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.\n\n## (x) Foreign exchange and exchange rates\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. The functional currency of the group's foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The assets and liabilities of all of the group's foreign operations are translated into sterling, the group's presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.\n\nThe closing exchange rates at 31 December 2020 were 1.37 United States dollar and 1.12 euro (31 December 2019: 1.33 United States dollar and 1.18 euro).\n\nThe average exchange rates for the year ended 31 December 2020 were 1.28 United States dollar and 1.13 euro (31 December 2019: 1.28 United States dollar and 1.14 euro).",

The profit/(loss) before tax reflects profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders, and includes \u00a3358m (2019: \u00a328m) of profit before tax attributable to equity holders in relation to discontinued operations (see Note 29).\n- 2. 2019 has been restated to reflect a reallocation of divisional-related project expenditure from Group investment projects and expenses to Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) within Operating profit from divisions. This has reduced LGIM operating profit by \u00a329m for the year ended 31 December 2019.\n- 3. Discontinued operations include the results of the Mature Savings division, the sale of which completed on 7 September 2020 (see Note 29). In 2019, discontinued operations also included the results of the General Insurance division.\n- 4. Group debt costs exclude interest on non recourse borrowings.\n- 5. Covid-19 costs reflect incremental operational expenses incurred as a result of Covid-19 and include IT spend on delivering remote working solutions.\n\nThis supplementary operating profit information (one of the group's key performance indicators) provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and the group believes it provides shareholders with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year.\n\n- \u00b7 LGR represents worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance (within LGRI), and retail retirement and lifetime mortgages (within LGRR).\n- \u00b7 LGIM represents institutional and retail investment management and workplace savings businesses.\n- \u00b7 LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments primarily in the areas of housing, urban regeneration, clean energy and SME finance, as well as traded and treasury assets.\n- \u00b7 LGI primarily represents UK and US retail protection business, UK group protection and Fintech business.\n\nOperating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes and exceptional items. Operating profit therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the group's insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except the operating profit for LGC's trading businesses (which reflects the IFRS profit before tax). Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return assumptions are reported below operating profit, which include any differences between investment return on actual assets and the target long-term asset mix. Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as gains/losses from mergers and acquisition, and start-up costs, are also excluded from operating profit.",

Release from operations within US (LGIA) includes \u00a384m of dividends from the US.\n- 2. LGIM (excluding Workplace Savings) includes profits on fund management services.\n- 3. Workplace Savings represents administration business only.\n- 4. Other includes experience variances, changes in valuation assumptions and non-cash items for LGIA.\n- 5. Discontinued operations include the results of the Mature Savings division, the sale of which completed on 7 September 2020.\n- 6. Covid-19 costs reflect incremental operational expenses incurred as a result of Covid-19 and include IT spend on delivering remote working solutions.\n\nRelease from operations for LGR, LGIM - Workplace Savings and LGI UK and Other represents the expected IFRS surplus generated in the year from the difference between the prudent assumptions underlying the IFRS liabilities and our best estimate of future experience for in-force non-profit annuities, workplace savings and UK protection businesses. The LGIM release from operations also includes operating profit after tax from the institutional and retail investment management businesses. The LGI release from operations also includes dividends remitted from LGIA. The release from operations within discontinued operations primarily reflects the unwind of expected profits after tax under the risk transfer agreement with ReAssure Limited from the Mature Savings business.\n\nNew business surplus/strain for LGR, LGIM - Workplace Savings and LGI UK and Other represents the initial profit or loss from writing new business. This includes the costs associated with acquiring new business and setting up prudent reserves in respect of new business for UK non-profit annuities, workplace savings and protection, net of tax. The new business surplus and release from operations for LGR, LGIM and LGI excludes any capital held in excess of the prudent reserves from the liability calculation.\n\nLGR's new business metrics are presented based on a target long-term asset portfolio. At certain period ends, depending upon the quantum and timing of pension risk transfer (PRT) volumes, we may have sourced more or less of the high quality assets targeted to support that business. At year end, the profit impact of the difference between the actual assets held (including alternative surplus assets where suitable) and the long-term asset mix is reflected in investment variance.\n\nNet release from operations for LGR, LGIM - Workplace Savings, LGI and discontinued operations is defined as release from operations plus new business surplus/(strain).\n\nRelease from operations and net release from operations for LGC and LGIM (excluding workplace savings) represents the operating profit (net of tax).\n\nSee Note 2 (iii) for more detail on experience variances, changes to valuation assumptions and non-cash items.",

It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares. For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.\n\nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees. Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.\n\n## (i) Basic earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                          | After tax 2020 \u00a3m   | Per share\u00b9 2020 p   | After tax 2019 \u00a3m   | Per share\u00b9 2019 p   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders                                       | 1,607               | 27.10               | 1,834               | 30.92               |\n| Less: coupon payable in respect of restricted tier 1 convertible notes net of tax relief | (6)                 | (0.10)              | -                   | -                   |\n| Total basic earnings                                                                     | 1,601               | 27.00               | 1,834               | 30.92               |\n| Less: earnings derived from discontinued operations                                      | (290)               | (4.89)              | (23)                | (0.39)              |\n| Basic earnings derived from continuing operations                                        | 1,311               | 22.11               | 1,811               | 30.53               |\n\n## (ii) Diluted earnings per share\n\n|                                                                 | After tax 2020 \u00a3m   | Weighted   average  number of  shares 2020 m   | Per share\u00b9 2020 p   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders              | 1,607               | 5,930                                          | 27.10               |\n| Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration | -                   | 40                                             | (0.18)              |\n| Conversion of restricted tier 1 convertible notes               | -                   | 307                                            | (1.32)              |\n| Total diluted earnings                                          | 1,607               | 6,277                                          | 25.60               |\n| Less: diluted earnings derived from discontinued operations     | (290)               | -                                              | (4.62)              |\n| Diluted earnings derived from continuing operations             | 1,317               | 6,277                                          | 20.98               |\n\n|                                                                 | After tax  2019  \u00a3m   | Weighted  average  number of  shares  2019  m   | Per share\u00b9 2019  p   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders              | 1,834                 | 5,932                                           | 30.92                |\n| Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration | -                     | 33                                              | (0.17)               |\n| Total diluted earnings                                          | 1,834                 | 5,965                                           | 30.75                |\n| Less: diluted earnings derived from discontinued operations     | (23)                  | -                                               | (0.39)               |\n| Diluted earnings derived from continuing operations             | 1,811                 | 5,965                                           | 30.36                |",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management\n\n## 6 Principal products\n\nA significant part of the group's business involves the acceptance and management of risk.\n\nA description of the principal products offered by the group's segments is outlined below. The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through controls which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board. The group's risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 40 to 47.\n\nThe group has historically offered a range of products to meet customers' long-term savings objectives, including: non-participating savings, pension and endowment contracts; participating savings business (comprising endowment contracts, with-profit pensions, with-profit annuities and with-profit bonds); and unit-linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products. All balances and exposures in relation to these products have been removed from the group's balance sheet following the completion of the sale of the Mature Savings business on 7 September 2020.\n\nDetails of the risks associated with the group's principal products and the controls used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 7 and 16 to 18.\n\n## Legal & General Retirement (LGR)\n\n## Annuity contracts\n\nAnnuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment. No surrender value is available under any of these products.\n\nPension Risk Transfer (PRT) represents bulk annuities, whereby the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund. These are written predominantly to UK clients but increasing internationally.\n\nImmediate annuity contracts are offered to individual policyholders. Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.\n\nSome non-participating deferred annuities sold by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting. The value of such guaranteed options is currently immaterial.\n\nThere is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non-profit business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases. In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative. The total annual annuity value of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2020 was \u00a31,170m (2019: \u00a3930m). Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately \u00a312m (2019: \u00a39m). Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs. Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.\n\nThe group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder. The products can provide a fixed lump sum at maturity and/or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms.\n\nThe group writes Assured Payment Policies (APP). An APP is a long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over time from the insurer.\n\n## Longevity insurance contracts\n\nThe group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return. Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nLifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments. They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 55 through specialist intermediaries. Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due. Loans can be advanced in a single lump sum amount or in several subsequent drawdowns of an agreed facility. All lifetime mortgages provide a 'no negative equity' guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and if the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.\n\n## Lifetime Care Plan\n\nThe Lifetime Care Plan provides a monthly payment to a UK registered care provider that helps meet the cost of care for the policyholder's life. A policyholder can choose to receive a fixed monthly payment or opt to have escalation built in. A death benefit exists within the product, so that if a policyholder dies within the first 6 months of the start date, a percentage of the original premium less any payments already made is payable to the estate.\n\n## Retirement Interest Only mortgages\n\nA Retirement Interest Only (RIO) mortgage is a standard residential mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house.\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term. No repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.",

LGC's investments fall into two distinct categories: direct investments and traded assets. The value of, and income from, both categories is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy. Potential volatility in returns is managed using a range of techniques, including foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.\n\n## Direct investments and structuring\n\nDirect investments are an integral part of the wider group strategy. LGC's direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by the creation of new companies. LGC seeks to make direct investments in sectors where there are structural funding shortfalls, and is organised into three sectors: housing, future cities (including urban regeneration and clean energy) and SME finance (including venture capital). LGC employs capital and sector expertise to such investments to target attractive risk-adjusted returns which can deliver higher returns and / or lower volatility for our shareholder capital than listed equity.",

The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter. During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract. After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.\n\nReinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims. These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the group's balance sheet. Within LGA, reinsurance and securitisation are also used to provide regulatory solvency relief (including relief from regulation governing term insurance and universal life reserves).\n\n## US universal life\n\nUniversal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate. LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate. LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.\n\n## Annuities\n\nImmediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGR. Deferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.",

Similarly, for longevity and credit risk syndication transactions, the  group targets the use of strongly rated counterparties and seeks to ensure |\n| Property lending counterparty risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Property lending counterparty risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Property lending counterparty risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| As part of our asset diversification strategy, we hold  property lending and sale and leaseback investments.

A limited level of contingent liquidity risk is, however, an  accepted element of writing insurance contracts. It is furthermore a  consequence of the markets in which the group operates and the execution  of investment management strategies. However, the group's insurance  businesses seek to maintain sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities  to meet a prudent estimate of the cash outflows that may arise from  contingent events. The level of required liquidity is identified using  techniques including stress tests for shock events and the profile of actual  liquid assets is regularly compared to the required liability profile. The  group's treasury function provides formal facilities to other areas of the  group to cover contingent liquidity requirements arising from more extreme  events and where investment assets may not be readily realisable. |\n| Collateral liquidity risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Collateral liquidity risk | Collateral liquidity risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Within the annuities business, the use of financial  instruments to hedge default, interest rate, currency and  inflation risks can require the posting of collateral with  counterparties at short notice.                                                                                                             | LGR, LGC and Group        | Liquidity requirements to meet potential collateral calls under stressed  conditions are actively managed and an appropriate pool of eligible assets is  maintained with counterparties as specified in the associated agreements.

        "page_content": "## 8 Assets analysis\n\nThe group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks. Various reinsurance arrangements are in place as a mechanism to mitigate the risks, including a risk transfer agreement with ReAssure Limited, which was effective from 1 January 2018 until the completion of the sale of the Mature Savings business on 7 September 2020, and under the terms of the group transferred all economic risks and rewards of the Mature Savings business, including with-profits, to ReAssure Limited.\n\nThe four categorisations presented are:\n\n## Unit linked\n\nFor unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations. Unit linked business is written in both Legal and General Assurance Society Limited and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited. The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders. The group is therefore not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts. As a result, risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.\n\n## With-profits\n\nPolicyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits fund. The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders' equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the fund and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year. The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns. The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.\n\nFollowing the completion of the sale of the Mature Savings business on 7 September 2020, the group no longer retains any with-profits assets or liabilities.\n\n## Non profit non-unit linked\n\nShareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business.\n\n## Shareholder\n\nAll other assets are classified as shareholder assets. Shareholders of the group are directly exposed to market and credit risk on these assets. This includes the assets and liabilities of our overseas insurance operations and general insurance.\n\nThe table below presents an analysis of the balance sheet by category. All of the quantitative risk disclosures in Notes 16 and 17 have been provided using this categorisation.",

The value of business acquired represents the present value of anticipated future profits in acquired contracts. These amounts are amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.\n\nOther intangible assets mainly consist of customer relationships, brand and capitalised software costs. Intangible assets acquired via business combinations are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised on a straight line method over their estimated useful life. Where software costs are separately identifiable and measurable, they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life on a straight line basis.\n\nPurchased interest in long-term businesses and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\n|                                         | PILTB insurance contracts 2020 \u00a3m   | PILTB investment contracts 2020 \u00a3m   | Other intangible assets 2020 \u00a3m   | Total 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                                    |                                     |                                      |                                   |                 |\n| As at 1 January                         | 382                                 | 33                                   | 349                               | 764             |\n| Additions\u00b9                              | -                                   | -                                    | 166                               | 166             |\n| Disposals\u00b2                              | (24)                                | (2)                                  | (30)                              | (56)            |\n| Decrease due to currency translation    | (7)                                 | -                                    | (1)                               | (8)             |\n| Other movements\u00b3                        | (4)                                 | (31)                                 | (79)                              | (114)           |\n| As at 31 December                       | 347                                 | -                                    | 405                               | 752             |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment |                                     |                                      |                                   |                 |\n| As at 1 January                         | (379)                               | (33)                                 | (162)                             | (574)           |\n| Amortisation for the year               | -                                   | -                                    | (21)                              | (21)            |\n| Impairment                              | -                                   | -                                    | -                                 | -               |\n| Disposals 2                             | 24                                  | 2                                    | 25                                | 51              |\n| Decrease due to currency translation    | 7                                   | -                                    | -                                 | 7               |\n| Other movements\u00b3                        | 1                                   | 31                                   | 82                                | 114             |\n| As at 31 December                       | (347)                               | -                                    | (76)                              | (423)           |\n| Total net book value as at 31 December  | -                                   | -                                    | 329                               | 329             |\n| To be amortised within 12 months        |                                     |                                      |                                   | 60              |\n| To be amortised after 12 months         |                                     |                                      |                                   | 269             |\n\n- 1.

These are accounted for in line with the appropriate accounting standards as follows:\n\n## Long-term insurance business\n\nAcquisition costs comprise direct costs, such as initial commission, and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business. Some acquisition costs relating to non-participating insurance contracts written outside the with-profits fund which are incurred during a financial year are deferred by use of an asset which is amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable, and in accordance with the expected incidence of future related margins. For participating contracts, acquisition costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nFor participating investment contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business. These costs are charged to the income statement when incurred. For non-participating investment contracts, only directly attributable costs relating to investment management services which vary with, and are related to, securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are capitalised and amortised over the period during which the service is provided on a straight line basis. All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.\n\n|                                                         | Insurance contracts 2020 \u00a3m   | Investment contracts 2020 \u00a3m   | Total 2020 \u00a3m   | Insurance contracts 2019 \u00a3m   | Investment contracts 2019 \u00a3m   | Total 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| As at 1 January                                         | 27                            | 465                            | 492             | 112                           | 466                            | 578             |\n| Change in accounting policy\u00b9                            | -                             | -                              | -               | (21)                          | -                              | (21)            |\n| Acquisition costs deferred                              | 48                            | 1                              | 49              | 161                           | 1                              | 162             |\n| Amortisation charged to income statement                | (54)                          | (2)                            | (56)            | (159)                         | (3)                            | (162)           |\n| Disposals\u00b2                                              | -                             | (438)                          | (438)           | (65)                          | -                              | (65)            |\n| Decrease due to currency translation                    | -                             | -                              | -               | (1)                           | -                              | (1)             |\n| Other                                                   | -                             | -                              | -               | -                             | 1                              | 1               |\n| Total as at 31 December                                 | 21                            | 26                             | 47              | 27                            | 465                            | 492             |\n| Less: assets of operations classified as held for sale\u00b3 | -                             | -                              | -               | -                             | (438)                          | (438)           |\n| As at 31 December                                       | 21                            | 26                             | 47              | 27                            | 27                             | 54              |\n| To be amortised within 12 months4                       | 21                            | 5                              | 26              | 27                            | 31                             | 58              |\n| To be amortised after 12 months4                        | -                             | 21                             | 21              | -                             | 434                            | 434             |\n\n- 2.

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management continued\n\n## 11 Financial investments and investment property\n\nThe group holds financial investments and investment property to back insurance contracts on behalf of policyholders and as group capital.\n\nThe group classifies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading (HFT), designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), available-for-sale (AFS) or loans and receivables. Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.\n\nThe group's policy is to measure investments at FVTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on a passive basis (not using current information), in which case investments are classified as AFS or loans held at amortised cost. Following the change in accounting policy described in Note 1 (iv), no long-term liabilities valued on a passive basis remain in the group. All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT.\n\nCertain financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the group's investment strategy. Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities (including lifetime and retirement interest only mortgages) and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS and reverse repurchase agreements within loans which would otherwise be designated at amortised cost. Assets backing participating and non-participating policyholder liabilities are designated as FVTPL. For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life. The group's non-participating investment contract liabilities are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.\n\nFinancial investments classified as HFT and designated at FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nFinancial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity. Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.\n\nFinancial investments classified as loans are either designated at FVTPL, or initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The designated at FVTPL classification currently only applies to reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nFinancial investments are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial investments are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire, or when the group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those measured at FVTPL, are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet date. They are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events after initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.\n\nInvestment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth, as well as right-of-use assets of the same nature. It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.\n\nInvestment property in the UK is valued at least bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the 'Appraisal and Valuation Manual' of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period. Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned. In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.\n\nRight-of-use investment property assets relate to long-leasehold interests in land held solely for the purposes of the related investment property asset. The group applies the fair value model to these interests as they meet the definition of investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'.\n\nThe group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of various transactions, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. The amount and type of collateral required where the group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.\n\nCollateral received in the form of cash, where the group has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for its repayment. Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nNon-cash collateral pledged where the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated is not derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nCash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.",

The assets used as collateral are Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA and AA Corporate Bonds and Cash (2019: Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA and AA Corporate Bonds and Cash). The group is entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the asset during the period when it is pledged as collateral. Further, there is no obligation to pay or transfer these cash flows to another entity. The group can decide to substitute an asset which is designated as collateral at any time, provided the relevant terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association agreement are met.\n\nFinancial investments include \u00a353,853m (2019: \u00a356,884m) of assets that have been sold but not derecognised and are subject to repurchase agreements. The related obligation to repurchase the financial assets is included within Payables and other financial liabilities (Note 25).\n\nVarious pension risk transfer deals include collateralised structures. \u00a38,022m (2019: \u00a37,556m) of Corporate Bonds and Treasury Gilts are pledged as collateral in relation to these.\n\nCollateral of \u00a3760m (2019: \u00a3323m) made up of Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds (AAA, AA, A and BBB) was pledged out in respect of the reinsurance agreements. These assets are neither past due, not impaired. The carrying value of these assets reflects the full exposure value of these assets.\n\nFinancial investments have been allocated between those expected to be settled within 12 months and after 12 months in line with the expected settlement of the backed liabilities. Assets in excess of the insurance and investment contract liabilities have been classified as expected to be settled after 12 months.\n\n## (i) Financial investments at fair value\n\n|                                           | Notes   | Shareholder 2020 \u00a3m   | Non profit non-unit linked 2020 \u00a3m   | With- profits 2020 \u00a3m   | Unit linked 2020 \u00a3m   | Total 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Equity securities                         |         | 3,037                 | 49                                   | -                       | 186,003               | 189,089         |\n| Debt securities\u00b9                          |         | 5,047                 | 79,893                               | -                       | 209,286               | 294,226         |\n| Accrued interest                          |         | 17                    | 545                                  | -                       | 872                   | 1,434           |\n| Derivative assets                         | 13      | 68                    | 20,868                               | -                       | 3,695                 | 24,631          |\n| Loans at fair value                       | 11(ii)  | 595                   | 3,522                                | -                       | 12,429                | 16,546          |\n| Total financial investments at fair value |         | 8,764                 | 104,877                              | -                       | 412,285               | 525,926         |\n\n|                                           | Notes   | Shareholder 2019 \u00a3m   | Non profit non-unit linked 2019 \u00a3m   | With- profits 2019 \u00a3m   | Unit linked 2019 \u00a3m   | Total 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Equity securities\u00b2                        |         | 2,670                 | 194                                  | 3,103                   | 194,398               | 200,365         |\n| Debt securities\u00b9 , \u00b3                      |         | 5,387                 | 69,530                               | 5,468                   | 206,859               | 287,244         |\n| Accrued interest\u00b3                         |         | 23                    | 531                                  | 44                      | 1,050                 | 1,648           |\n| Derivative assets                         | 13      | 108                   | 11,448                               | 115                     | 3,157                 | 14,828          |\n| Loans at fair value                       | 11(ii)  | 632                   | 630                                  | 397                     | 14,718                | 16,377          |\n| Total financial investments at fair value |         | 8,820                 | 82,333                               | 9,127                   | 420,182               | 520,462         |\n\nAccrued interest in the above tables represents accrued interest on debt securities only.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the group's view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. The group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nThe levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1: fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nThe group's financial assets are valued, where possible, using standard market pricing sources, such as IHS Markit, ICE and Bloomberg, or Index Providers such as Barclays, Merrill Lynch or JPMorgan. Each uses mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, with the exception of OTC Derivative holdings, which are marked to market using an in-house system (Lombard Oberon), external vendor (IHS Markit), internal model or Counterparty Broker marks. Where inputs to the valuation have been sourced from a market that is not suitably active the prices have been classified as Level 2. Refer to Note 11 (iii) (a) for Level 3 methodology.\n\nThe group's investment properties are valued by appropriately qualified external valuers using unobservable inputs, resulting in all investment property being classified as Level 3.\n\nThe group's policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time.\n\nDuring the year the group has enhanced the level of market data it uses to support the determination of the observability of valuation inputs, and as a result a significant number of debt securities, totalling \u00a337,103m as at 31 December 2019, transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.",

As part of a change in accounting policy for LGIA universal life and annuity reserves, certain financial investments were reclassified from designated as amortised cost to designated as fair value through profit or loss. Accordingly, the 2019 balances for Debt securities and Accrued interest have been restated to reflect the fair value of those assets.

Unquoted securities include suspended securities, investments in private equity and property vehicles. Untraded debt securities include private placements, commercial real estate loans, income strips and lifetime and retirement interest only mortgages.\n\nIn many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classified within Level 3.\n\nThe group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the group's credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.\n\nFair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker. These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.\n\nThe group's policy is to reassess the categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time.\n\n|                                           | Equity securities 2020 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2020 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2020 \u00a3m   | Total 2020 \u00a3m   | Equity securities 2019 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2019 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2019 \u00a3m   | Total 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| As at 1 January                           | 2,035                       | 19,402                                | 9,107                         | 30,544          | 1,757                       | 13,915                                | 8,608                         | 24,280          |\n| Total gains/(losses) for the year         |                             |                                       |                               |                 |                             |                                       |                               |                 |\n| - in other comprehensive income           | -                           | 2                                     | -                             | 2               | -                           | 20                                    | -                             | 20              |\n| - realised and unrealised gains/(losses)\u00b9 | (85)                        | 1,367                                 | (85)                          | 1,197           | 51                          | 1,384                                 | (86)                          | 1,349           |\n| Purchases / Additions                     | 283                         | 2,491                                 | 1,019                         | 3,793           | 416                         | 5,680                                 | 1,187                         | 7, 2 8 3        |\n| Sales / Disposals\u00b2                        | (451)                       | (1,123)                               | (1,566)                       | (3,140)         | (199)                       | (1,850)                               | (675)                         | (2,724)         |\n| Transfers into Level 3                    | 52                          | -                                     | -                             | 52              | 21                          | 5                                     | 73                            | 99              |\n| Transfers out of Level 3                  | (32)                        | (87)                                  | -                             | (119)           | (10)                        | (11)                                  | -                             | (21)            |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements\u00b3          | (1)                         | (95)                                  | -                             | (96)            | (1)                         | (70)                                  | -                             | (71)            |\n| Change in accounting policy4              | -                           | -                                     | -                             | -               | -                           | 329                                   | -                             | 329             |\n| As at 31 December                         | 1,801                       | 21,957                                | 8,475                         | 32,233          | 2,035                       | 19,402                                | 9,107                         | 30,544          |\n\n- 1. The realised and unrealised gains and losses have been recognised in Investment return in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n- 2. Disposals include \u00a3926m of Investment property and \u00a3234m of Equity securities that relate to the sale of the Mature Savings business, which completed on 7 September 2020.\n- 3. The 2019 balance has been represented to separate foreign exchange from realised and unrealised gains/(losses).\n- 4. As part of a change in accounting policy for LGIA universal life and annuity reserves, certain financial investments were reclassified from designated as amortised cost to designated as fair value through profit or loss. Accordingly, the 2019 balance for Other financial investments has been restated to reflect the fair value of those assets. Further details on the change in accounting policy are provided in Note 1 (iv).\n\n## Asset valuation approach at 31 December 2020\n\nWhile recognising the volatility within asset markets, our approach to the valuation of assets as at 31 December 2020 was substantially consistent with our usual processes, policies and methodologies. However, we have applied increased focus on the valuation of those assets more directly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly Level 3 assets. Given the diversity of our portfolio, the impact has been varied with certain asset classes and market sectors more exposed to the impact of Covid-19 than others. In assessing the valuation of such assets, in line with applicable standards and guidance (including compliance with Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEV) guidelines), we have both projected the short-term impact on earnings and cash flows of the current market volatility, while continuing to review the assets' ability to deliver longer-term returns aligned to their investment cases.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nLevel 3 equity securities amount to \u00a31,801m (2019: \u00a32,035m), of which the majority is made up of holdings in investment property vehicles and private investment funds. They are valued at the proportion of the group's holding of the Net Asset Value reported by the investment vehicles. Other equity securities are valued by a number of third party specialists using a range of techniques which are often dependent on the maturity of the underlying investment but can also depend on the characteristics of individual investments. Such techniques include transaction values underpinned by analysis of milestone achievement, and cash runway for early/start-up stage investments, discounted cash flow models for investments at the next stage of development and earnings multiples for more mature investments.",

        "page_content": "## Other financial investments\n\nLifetime mortgage (LTM) loans amount to \u00a36,036m (2019: \u00a34,733m). They are valued using a discounted cash flow model by projecting best-estimate net asset proceeds and discounting using rates inferred from current LTM loan pricing. The inferred illiquidity premiums for the majority of the portfolio range between 100 and 350bps. This ensures the value of loans at outset is consistent with the purchase price of the loan, and achieves consistency between new and in-force loans. The mortgages include a no negative equity guarantee (NNEG) to borrowers. This ensures that if there is a shortfall between the sale proceeds of the house and the outstanding loan balance on redemption of the loan, the value of the loan will be reduced by this amount. The NNEG on loan redemption is valued as a series of put options, which we calculate using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula. Key assumptions in the valuation of lifetime mortgages include long-term property growth rates, property index volatility, voluntary early repayments and longevity assumptions. The valuation as at 31 December 2020 reflects a long-term property growth rate assumption of RPI + 0.1%, after allowing for the effects of dilapidation. The values of the properties collateralising the LTM loans are updated from the date of the last property valuation to the valuation date by indexing using UK regional house price indices.\n\nPrivate credit loans (including commercial real estate loans) amount to \u00a311,889m (2019: \u00a310,998m). Their valuation is determined by discounted future cash flows which are based on the yield curve of the LGIM approved comparable bonds and the initial spread, both of which are agreed by IHS Markit who also provided independent monthly valuation of comparable bonds. Unobservable inputs that go into the determination of comparators include: rating, sector, sub-sector, performance dynamics, financing structure and duration of investment. Existing private credit investments, which were executed back as far as 2011, are subject to a range of interest rate formats, although the majority are fixed rate. The weighted average duration of the portfolio is 11.0 years, with a weighted average life of 14.0 years. Maturities in the portfolio currently extend out to 2064. The private credit portfolio of assets is not externally rated but has internal ratings assigned by an independent credit team in line with internally developed methodologies. These credit ratings range from AAA to BB.\n\nPrivate placements held by the US business amount to \u00a32,049m (2019: \u00a31,673m). They are valued using a pricing matrix comprised of a public spread matrix, internal ratings assigned to each holding, average life of each holding, and a premium spread matrix. These are added to the risk-free rate to calculate the discounted cash flows and establish a market value for each investment grade private placement. The valuation as at 31 December 2020 reflects illiquidity premiums between 10 and 70bps.\n\nIncome strip assets amount to \u00a31,449m (2019: \u00a31,326m). Their valuation is outsourced to Knight Frank and CBRE who apply a yield to maturity to discounted future cash flows to derive valuations. The overall valuation takes into account the property location, tenant details, tenure, rent, rental break terms, lease expiries and underlying residual value of the property. The valuation as at 31 December 2020 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 2% and 7% and estimated rental values (ERV) between \u00a310 and \u00a3337 per sq.ft.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans amount to \u00a3419m (2019: \u00a3414m) and are determined by incorporating credit risk for performing loans at the portfolio level and for loans identified to be distressed at the loan level. The projected cash flows of each loan are discounted along stochastic risk free rate paths and are inclusive of an Option Adjusted Spread (OAS), derived from current internal pricing on new loans, along with the best observable inputs. The valuation as at 31 December 2020 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 40bps.\n\nOther debt securities which are not traded in an active market have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations. These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.\n\n## Investment property\n\nLevel 3 investment property amounting to \u00a38,475m (2019: \u00a39,107m) is valued with the involvement of external valuers. All property valuations are carried out in accordance with the latest edition of the Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and are undertaken by appropriately qualified valuers as defined therein. Whilst transaction evidence underpins the valuation process, the definition of market value, including the commentary, in practice requires the valuer to reflect the realities of the current market. In this context valuers must use their market knowledge and professional judgement and not rely only upon historic market sentiment based on historic transactional comparables.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties also include an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts, where the uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The valuation as at 31 December 2020 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 2% and 18% and ERV between \u00a31 and \u00a3356 per sq.ft.\n\nThe below table breaks down the investment property by sector.\n\n|                                 | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019\u00b9 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Retail                          | 999       | 1,139      |\n| Leisure                         | 440       | 508        |\n| Distribution                    | 1,142     | 851        |\n| Office space                    | 3,703     | 3,181      |\n| Industrial and other commercial | 1,588     | 1,562      |\n| Accommodation                   | 603       | 454        |\n| Total                           | 8,475     | 7, 6 95    |",

The table below shows the impact of applying these sensitivities on the fair value of Level 3 assets as at 31 December. In light of Covid-19, we have reviewed and reflected changes in those sensitivities, and further disclosure in how these sensitivities have been applied can be found in the sensitivity descriptions following the table.\n\n|                           |                    | Sensitivities           | Sensitivities           |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                           | Fair value 2020 \u00a3m | Positive impact 2020 \u00a3m | Negative impact 2020 \u00a3m |\n| Lifetime mortgages        | 6,036              | 392                     | (426)                   |\n| Private credit portfolios | 14,357             | 1,050                   | (1,050)                 |\n| Investment property       | 8,475              | 711                     | (722)                   |\n| Other investments\u00b9        | 3,365              | 268                     | (289)                   |\n| Total Level 3 investments | 32,233             | 2,421                   | (2,487)                 |\n\nThe sensitivities are not a function of sensitising a single variable relating to the valuation of the asset, but rather a function of flexing multiple factors often at individual asset level. The following sets out a number of key factors by asset type, and how they have been flexed to derive reasonable alternative valuations.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nKey assumptions used in the valuation of the Lifetime mortgage asset are listed in Note 11(iii)(b) and sensitivities are applied to each assumption to arrive at the overall sensitised values in the above table. The most significant sensitivity by value is +/-10% instant reduction in property valuation across the portfolio which, applied in isolation produces sensitised values of \u00a3311m and (\u00a3349m). During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic an increased dispersion in pricing coupled with general market uncertainty resulted in a higher level of uncertainty associated with these assets. While pricing has largely contracted at the balance sheet date continued market uncertainty has been reflected in the sensitivities.\n\n## Private credit portfolios\n\nThe sensitivity in the private credit portfolio has been determined through a method which estimates investment spread value premium differences as compared to the institutional investment market. Individual investment characteristics of each holding, such as credit rating and duration are used to determine spread differentials for the purposes of determining alternate values. Spread differentials are determined to be higher for highly rated and/or shorter duration assets as compared to lower rated and/or longer duration assets. Factors influencing the sensitivities under normal conditions are further adjusted during more volatile market conditions, as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to acknowledge an anticipated wider range of investor value determination. If we were to take an A rated asset in normal market conditions with an estimated premium difference of 15bps (as opposed to 30bps for a similar duration BBB rated asset) this would be increased by 15bps under stressed market conditions. Applied in isolation the additional sensitivity used to reflect the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic produces sensitised values of \u00a3219m and (\u00a3219m).\n\n## Investment property\n\nInvestment property holdings are valued by independent valuers on the basis of open market value as defined in the appraisal and valuation manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). As such, sensitivities are calculated through a mixture of asset level and portfolio level methodologies which make reference to individual investment characteristics of the holding but do not flex individual assumptions used by the independent expert in valuing the holdings. Each method is applied individually and aggregated with equal weighting to determine the overall sensitivity determined for the portfolio. One method is similar to that used in the private credit portfolio as it determines the impact of an alternate property yield determined in reference to credit ratings, remaining term and other characteristics of each holding. In this methodology we would apply a lower yield sensitivity to a highly rated and/or shorter remaining term asset compared with a lower rated and/or longer remaining term asset. If we were to take an AA rated asset with remaining term of 25 years in normal market conditions this would lead to a 15bps yield flex (as opposed to a 35bps yield flex for a BBB rated asset with 30 year remaining term). The methodology which leads to the most significant sensitivity at the balance sheet date is related to an example in case law where it was found that an acceptable margin of error in a valuation dispute is 10% either way, subject to the valuation being undertaken with due care. If this sensitivity were to be taken without a weighting it would produce sensitised values of \u00a3620m and (\u00a3620m).\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic a number of property valuations were provided in the group's interim financial statements as at 30 June 2020 on the basis of 'material valuation uncertainty' as per VPS3 and VPG10 of the RICS Red Book Global. Independent valuers confirmed that the inclusion of 'material valuation uncertainty' clauses does not mean that the valuations cannot be relied upon. Consequently, less certainty and a higher degree of caution should be attached to the valuations provided than would normally be the case. Rather, the clause is used to be clear and transparent with all parties that, in the context of the market conditions, less certainty can be attached to valuations than would otherwise be the case. At half year this was reflected as an addition to the sensitivities applied increasing the range. At the 31 December 2020 balance sheet date all such 'material uncertainty clauses' have been withdrawn by the independent valuers and therefore the additional sensitivity has been removed.\n\nIt should be noted that some sensitivities described above are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.",

        "page_content": "## 13 Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nThe group's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. The group's principal uses of hedge accounting are to:\n\n- (i) Defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur.\n- (ii)   Hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement; and\n- (iii)  Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: a hedge of the exposure to the currency risk of a net investment in a foreign entity.\n\nThe relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction. The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis. Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges (between 80% and 125% effectiveness) with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the current year.\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nWhere the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.\n\nCash inflows and outflows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts - net investment hedges\n\nThe group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in certain overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts. It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, along with the gain or loss on translation of the foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Other derivative contracts - held for trading\n\nThe group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the group's risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship. Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.",

In order to hedge these risks the group has entered into a cross currency interest rate swap, enabling the exposure to be swapped into a fixed rate in its functional currency. These had a fair value liability totalling \u00a374m (2019: \u00a351m) and a notional amount of \u00a31,099m (2019: \u00a31,099m) at 31 December 2020.

Inventories represent house building stock including land, options on land, work in progress and other inventory.\n- 2. Contract assets represent the entity's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer.\n- 3. Other receivables include amounts receivable from brokers and clients for investing activities, collateral pledges, unsettled cash, FX spots and other sundry balances.\n- 4. Assets of operations classified as held for sale relate to the Mature Savings business, the sale of which completed on 7 September 2020.\n\n## (i) Receivables under finance leases\n\nThe group leases certain investment properties to third parties. Under these agreements, substantially all the risks and reward incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee; therefore the contracts have been classified as finance leases. At the lease commencement date, the group derecognises the investment property asset and recognises a receivable asset on its balance sheet to reflect the net investment in the lease, equal to the present value of the lease payments. The group recognises finance income over the lease term to reflect the rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\nThe group acts as a lessor of certain finance leases, which have a weighted average duration to maturity of 30 years as at 31 December 2020. The counterparties, as lessee, are regarded to be the economic owner of the leased assets.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments under the arrangement, together with the present value, are disclosed below:\n\n|               |   Total future payments 2020 \u00a3m | Unearned interest income 2020 \u00a3m   |   Present value 2020 \u00a3m |   Total future payments 2019 \u00a3m | Unearned interest income 2019 \u00a3m   |   Present value 2019 \u00a3m |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Within 1 year |                              10 | (6)                                |                       4 |                              10 | (6)                                |                       4 |\n| 1-2 years     |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 2-3 years     |                              11 | (5)                                |                       6 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 3-4 years     |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 4-5 years     |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| After 5 years |                             210 | (62)                               |                     148 |                             210 | (63)                               |                     147 |\n| Total         |                             261 | (88)                               |                     173 |                             260 | (89)                               |                     171 |",

        "page_content": "## 16 Market risk continued (ii) Currency risk\n\nThe group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies; nearly all such holdings are either backing insurance contracts in the same currency, or are hedged back to GBP.\n\nThe group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. The largest United States dollar currency exposures relate to the group's US business, Legal & General America. The majority of currency exposures relating to euros are held by Legal & General Investment Management (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Legal & General Investment Management Limited. The group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.\n\nBusinesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the group's consolidated shareholders' equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives may be used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the group held 14% (2019: 15%) of its total equity attributable to shareholders in currencies, mainly United States dollar and euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit. The exchange risks inherent in these exposures may be mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.\n\nConsistent with the group's accounting policies, the profits of overseas business units (reported as functional currencies) are translated at average exchange rates and the net assets (reported as functional currencies) at the closing rate for the reporting period. A 10% increase (weakening of foreign currencies) or decrease (strengthening of foreign currencies) in these rates would increase or reduce the profit for the year and net assets as follows:\n\n|                                               | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2020  \u00a3m                                  | 2019  \u00a3m                                  | 2020  \u00a3m                                  | 2019  \u00a3m                                  |\n| Profit for the year\u00b9                          | 18                                        | (1)                                       | (22)                                      | 1                                         |\n| Net assets attributable to USD exposures\u00b9 , \u00b2 | (80)                                      | (47)                                      | 98                                        | 57                                        |\n\n|                                           | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                           | 2020  \u00a3m                                  | 2019  \u00a3m                                  | 2020  \u00a3m                                  | 2019  \u00a3m                                  |\n| Profit for the year\u00b9                      | -                                         | -                                         | -                                         | -                                         |\n| Net assets attributable to EUR exposures\u00b9 | (73)                                      | (103)                                     | 90                                        | 125                                       |",

If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset. Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classified as available for sale.\n\nThe table below includes assets at FVTPL, which provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired and the ageing analysis of financial assets which are past due but not impaired.

The  cost of health related claims depends on both the  incidence of policyholders becoming ill and the duration  over which they remain ill. Higher than expected  incidence or duration would increase costs over the  level currently assumed in the calculation of liabilities. | LGR        | trends in mortality and morbidity having regard to past experience.  Underwriting criteria are defined setting out the risks that are unacceptable  and the terms for non-standard risks presented by the lives to be insured.  Extensive use of reinsurance is made within the UK retail protection  business, placing a proportion of all risks meeting prescribed criteria.  Mortality and morbidity experience is compared to that assumed within  the pricing basis with variances subject to actuarial investigation.  Annuity business is priced having regard to trends in improvements in future  mortality. Enhanced annuities, which are priced taking account of  impairments to life expectancy, are subject to specific underwriting criteria. |\n| For annuity contracts, the group is exposed to the risk  that mortality experience is lower than assumed. Lower  than expected mortality would require payments to be  made for longer and increase the cost of benefits  provided.

In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long-term and short-term insurance business written by the group. However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure. The group's capital model seeks to measure risk correlations, particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme. An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the group's businesses. The group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or reputational damage.",

Other non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the group's operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.\n\nThe group seeks to make prudent assumptions about future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience. Assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.\n\n## (i) Mortality and morbidity\n\nMortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK business are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau (CMIB), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Assumptions include an appropriate allowance for prudence. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.\n\nThe group conducts statistical investigations of its mortality and morbidity experience, the majority of which are carried out at least annually. Investigations determine the extent to which the group's experience differs from that underpinning the standard tables, and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.\n\nFor 2020 reporting the group has concluded that there is insufficient certainty to revise long-term assumptions in response to emerging claims experience relating to Covid-19. For protection contracts, certain short-term allowances have been made to reflect the impact of the higher mortality expected from the pandemic in 2021, based on applying projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation to our insured population.\n\nIn most cases, mortality rates are set separately for sex and smoker status, and the percentage of mortality table will vary for the first 2-5 years of the policy's duration to allow for underwriting selection.\n\n| Mortality tables                          | 2020                                                                          | 2019                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-linked individual assurance business  |                                                                               |                                                                               |\n| UK term assurances\u00b9                       | 99%-101% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                      | 98%-104% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                      |\n| UK term assurances with terminal illness\u00b9 | 63%-95% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                       | 62%-104% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                      |\n| UK term assurances with critical illness\u00b2 | 107%-159% ACL08 Sel 2                                                         | 112%-164% ACL04 Sel 2                                                         |\n| US term assurances\u00b3                       | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                         | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                         |\n| Whole of Life Protection Plan4            | Bespoke Tables based on TM08/TF08,  AM92/AF92 and UK death registrations      | Bespoke Tables based on TM08/TF08,  AM92/AF92 and UK death registrations      |\n| Whole of Life over 504                    | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15 and  Whole of Life Protection Plan  assumptions | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15 and  Whole of Life Protection Plan  assumptions |\n| Annuity business                          |                                                                               |                                                                               |\n| UK annuities in deferment5                | 71.9%-81.9% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                     | 73.1%-82.9% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                     |\n| UK vested annuities6                      |                                                                               |                                                                               |\n| Pension risk transfer                     | 72.7%-81.9% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                     | 73.9%-82.9% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                     |\n| Other annuities                           | 57.6%-105.1% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                    | 58.5%-95% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                       |\n| US annuities7                             | Bespoke tables based on RP-2014  Healthy Annuitant Total table                | Bespoke tables based on RP-2014  Healthy Annuitant Total table                |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## (ii) Valuation rates of interest and discount rates\n\nThe valuation interest rate used to discount the cash flows for the purpose of valuing insurance contract liabilities is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract.\n\nFor annuity business, an explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield. The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults on a prudent basis or, in the case of lifetime mortgage assets, a prudent expectation of losses arising from the No-Negative-Equity Guarantee. These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating. The allowance for risk for government backed bonds equated to 9bps (2019: 9bps) and 45bps for corporate bonds and direct investments (2019: 47bps). This is equivalent to a default provision of \u00a33.5 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a33.2 billion). For lifetime mortgage business, the allowance for risk in respect of lifetime mortgage assets is equivalent to \u00a30.6 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a30.5 billion).\n\nFor UK assurance business, different rates apply depending on whether the liabilities are positive or negative. An appropriate valuation interest rate is applied at all times during the projection, i.e. when liabilities switch from being negative to positive the valuation interest rate will also switch from being high to low. The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.\n\nFor US assurance business, the valuation interest rate is derived by combining the risk free yield curve (based on the USD curve specified by EIOPA for Solvency II) plus a risk adjusted spread addition based on the portfolio of assets LGA invests in. It includes prudent adjustments for default and reinvestment risk.\n\n| Rate of interest/discount rates   | 2020             | 2019             |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| UK life assurances                | 0.72%-2.24% p.a. | 1.07%-2.88% p.a. |\n| UK pension assurances             | 0.25%-2.15% p.a. | 1.00%-2.76% p.a. |\n| US life assurances                | 0.80%-2.40% p.a. | 2.37%-3.05% p.a. |\n| UK annuities - Fixed              | 1.28% p.a.       | 1.93% p.a.       |\n| UK annuities - Index Linked       | (1.85)% p.a.     | (1.28)% p.a.     |\n| US annuities                      | 2.29% p.a.       | 3.09% p.a.       |\n\n## (iii) Persistency\n\nThe group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually. Persistency experience can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.\n\nThe group tries to balance past experience and potential future conditions by making prudent assumptions about expected long-term average persistency levels.\n\nWhere explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.\n\nFor UK term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policy's lifetime (when it is treated as an asset) but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policy's lifetime (when it is treated as a liability). The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level. Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.\n\nFor US term assurance, a single margin is used across guaranteed period durations for a given policy. All US term assurance contracts are assumed to lapse at the end of the guaranteed period. Policies past the guaranteed period as of the valuation date are assumed to lapse on the next premium due date.\n\n| Lapse rates                             | 2020       | 2019       |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| UK Level term                           | 2.3%-25.7% | 2.2%-25.3% |\n| UK Decreasing term                      | 6.1%-14.6% | 6.1%-15.3% |\n| UK Accelerated critical illness cover   | 2.6%-26.4% | 2.6%-26.8% |\n| Pensions term                           | 2.3%-3.8%  | 2.2%-3.8%  |\n| Whole of Life (conventional non profit) | 0.5%-6.1%  | 0.5%-5.3%  |\n| US term - 10 year guarantee period      | 5.7%-6.5%  | 6.1%-6.4%  |\n| US term - 15 year guarantee period      | 3.4%-4.6%  | 3.4%-4.7%  |\n| US term - 20 year guarantee period      | 2.4%-4.9%  | 2.4%-4.6%  |\n| US term - 30 year guarantee period      | 1.7%-5.2%  | 1.8%-5.2%  |\n| US Universal Life                       | 1.9%       | n/a        |\n\n## (iv) Expenses\n\nThe group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.

pre-tax profit and equity, net of reinsurance, under each sensitivity scenario. The current disclosure reflects management's view of key risks in current economic conditions.\n\nIn calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged. In practice, items of the group's experience may be correlated.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses do not take into account management actions that could be taken to reduce the impacts. The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position. A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities. The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.\n\nThe sensitivity of the profit to changes in assumptions may not be linear. They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.\n\nThe change in interest rate test assumes a 100 basis point increase and a 50 basis point decrease in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with the same change in the real yields on variable securities. Valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields, adjusted to allow for prudence calculated in a manner consistent with the base results.\n\nThe inflation stress adopted is a 0.5% p.a. increase in inflation, resulting in a 0.5% p.a. reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield. In addition, the expense inflation rate is increased by 0.5% p.a.\n\nIn the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields remain unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress below.\n\nThe equity stresses are a 25% rise and 25% fall in listed equity market values.\n\nThe property stresses adopted are a 15% rise and 15% fall in property market values including lifetime mortgages. Rental income is assumed to be unchanged. Where property is being used to back liabilities, valuation interest rates move with property yields, and so the value of the liabilities will also move.\n\nThe credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of individual bonds and their outstanding term using Moody's global credit default rates. The credit default stress assumes a +/-10bps stress to the current unapproved credit default assumption, which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities. Other credit default allowances are unchanged. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress above.",

This is the case if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts.\n\nThe group historically had a number of insurance and investment contracts containing discretionary participating features (DPF), referred to as participating contracts. These included with-profits contracts in the UK. Following the completion of the sale of the Mature Savings business on 7 September 2020, the group no longer has any obligations related to such participating contracts.\n\n## Long-term insurance\n\nDeath claims are accounted for on notification of death. Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made. Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted. All other long-term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due. Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.\n\nThe change in the insurance liability reflects the reduction in liabilities due to the payment of claims in the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business. The movement also reflects assumption changes relating to variables such as claims expectations, expenses and the unwind of the previous period's expectations.\n\nUnder current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as permitted by IFRS 4, 'Insurance Contracts'.\n\n## UK\n\nFor non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method. This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs, and contractually guaranteed benefits. For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.\n\n## Overseas\n\nAll annuity and term assurance business written by overseas subsidiaries is recognised and measured in line with those written in the UK. All other long-term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reflect local supervisory principles.\n\n## Liability adequacy tests\n\nThe group performs liability adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of liabilities (less related deferred acquisition costs) is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows. When performing the liability adequacy test, the group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nThe group's insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing. Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured. Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy. Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.\n\nContracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk. Contracts that do not give rise to significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered to be financial reinsurance and are accounted for and disclosed in a manner consistent with financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "## 22 Investment contract liabilities\n\nNon-participating investment contract liabilities are measured at fair value. For unit linked liabilities, fair value is determined by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the group's unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date. For non linked liabilities, fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates an appropriate allowance for credit default risk. As described in Note 21, following the completion of the sale of the Mature Savings business on 7 September 2020, the group no longer has participating contracts on its balance sheet.\n\nClaims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities. The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the year less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.\n\n## (i) Analysis of non-participating investment contract liabilities\n\n|                                                                | Gross 2020 \u00a3m   | Reinsurance 2020 \u00a3m   | Gross 2019 \u00a3m   | Reinsurance 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Total non-participating investment contracts                   | 343,543         | (3)                   | 339,271         | (149)                 |\n| Less: liabilities of operations classified as held for sale 1  | -               | -                     | (18,677)        | 146                   |\n| Non-participating investment contract liabilities              | 343,543         | (3)                   | 320,594         | (3)                   |\n| Expected to be settled within 12 months (net of reinsurance) 2 | 44,878          |                       | 48,035          |                       |\n| Expected to be settled after 12 months (net of reinsurance) 2  | 298,662         |                       | 291,087         |                       |\n\nAmounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.

Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest rate method.\n\nBorrowings comprise core borrowings such as subordinated bond issues and long-term unsecured senior debt and operational borrowings such as commercial paper issuance and bank borrowings under both committed and uncommitted debt facilities, including bank overdrafts. Borrowings secured on specific assets/cash flows are included as non recourse borrowings.\n\n## (i) Analysis by type\n\n|                                                               | Borrowings excluding  unit linked borrowings 2020  \u00a3m   | Unit linked borrowings 2020  \u00a3m   | Total  2020  \u00a3m   | Borrowings excluding  unit linked borrowings 2019  \u00a3m   | Unit linked borrowings 2019  \u00a3m   | Total  2019  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Core borrowings                                               | 4,558                                                   | -                                 | 4,558             | 4,091                                                   | -                                 | 4,091             |\n| Operational borrowings                                        | 1,045                                                   | 10                                | 1,055             | 1,042                                                   | 7                                 | 1,049             |\n| Total borrowings                                              | 5,603                                                   | 10                                | 5,613             | 5,133                                                   | 7                                 | 5,140             |\n| Less: liabilities of operations classified as held for sale 1 | -                                                       | -                                 | -                 | (29)                                                    | -                                 | (29)              |\n| Borrowings                                                    | 5,603                                                   | 10                                | 5,613             | 5,104                                                   | 7                                 | 5,111             |\n\n- 1.

Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\nThe group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas. The assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds which are subject to regular actuarial valuations every three years, updated by formal reviews at reporting dates. The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be consistent or more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits' reporting.\n\nThe liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the Fund and Scheme is not restricted. Plan assets exclude the insurance contracts issued by the group. The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.\n\nThe group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.\n\n## (i) Analysis of provisions\n\n|                                                               | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Retirement benefit obligations                                | 1,165     | 1,107     |\n| Other provisions                                              | 123       | 114       |\n| Total provisions                                              | 1,288     | 1,221     |\n| Less: liabilities of operations classified as held for sale 1 | -         | (1)       |\n| Provisions                                                    | 1,288     | 1,220     |\n\n- 1.

As part of this arrangement, payments to the Fund and Scheme in respect of future accruals ceased from this date and were replaced with a company contribution payment of between 5% and 15% into a defined contribution arrangement. In addition, as part of the closure, the company will contribute an additional \u00a33m per annum until 31 December 2024 towards the deficit.\n\nThe assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long-term pension obligations to past and present employees. Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneficiaries. The trustees' long-term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer-term, control the ongoing operational costs of the schemes and to maximise investment returns for the beneficiaries within an acceptable level of risk.\n\nThe total number of members of the Fund and Scheme was:\n\n|                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employed deferreds | 93     | 140    |\n| Deferreds          | 2,960  | 3,113  |\n| Pensioners         | 3,723  | 3,669  |\n| Total              | 6,776  | 6,922  |\n\nThe group works closely with the trustees to develop an investment strategy for each UK scheme in order to meet the long-term objectives of the trustees as noted above. Each UK scheme has a Statement of Investment Principles which governs the mix of assets and limits for each class of asset. As noted below, the asset mix of the Fund is primarily split between investment funds including Liability Driven Investment (LDI) funds and unit trusts, and equities. The main intention of the use of LDI is to hedge movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rate and inflation expectations.\n\nCertain parts of the liabilities of the Fund and the Scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group. These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes, but at 31 December 2020 the value of these annuities, on an IAS 19 basis, was \u00a31,051m (2019: \u00a3944m).\n\nAdditionally, on 8 December 2020, the Scheme purchased an Assured Payment Policy ('APP') from the group to match the majority of the future expected cash flows of uninsured members of the Scheme. The APP is recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes. The value of the APP is included in the table summarising the plan assets.\n\nOn a gilts flat discount rate measure, including hedging from annuities, the Fund currently aims to hedge around 90% of the impact of changes in interest rate (gilt yields) and inflation expectations on its total liabilities. Similarly, on a gilts flat measure, including hedging from annuities and the APP, the Scheme currently aims to hedge around 90% of the impact of changes in interest rate and inflation expectations on its total liabilities.\n\nThe Fund and Scheme expose the group to a number of risks:\n\n| Risk Detail                       | Risk Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Uncertainty in   benefit payments | The value of the group's liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will primarily depend  on the level of inflation and how long individuals live.                                                                                          |\n| Volatility in   asset values      | The group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in the Fund and Scheme to meet future benefit payments.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Uncertainty in   cash funding     | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the group being required to provide higher levels of cash funding, although changes in  the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In addition, the group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation. |\n\nThese risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Fund and Scheme. The sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite.\n\nAnnuities are purchased to mitigate risks for certain parts of the pension liabilities which passes the risks from the Fund and Scheme onto the group.\n\nFull actuarial valuations are carried out for the Fund and Scheme every three years, updated by formal reviews at each anniversary date between. The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting. The latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 was completed on 1 July 2020. Where the Fund or Scheme are in deficit following the triennial valuations, the group and the trustee agree a deficit recovery plan. Both the Fund and Scheme have formal deficit recovery plans which aim to make good the deficits over a certain period of time. The triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 showed a total funding deficit for both the Fund and Scheme of \u00a3541m. As a result of this, a recovery plan was agreed of \u00a377m per annum from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2020, \u00a398m per annum from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2024 and a one-off catch-up payment of \u00a333m by 31 July 2020.",

The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 90% of worldwide assets of the group's defined benefit schemes.\n\nThe principal actuarial assumptions for the Fund and Scheme were:\n\n|                                                            | Fund and Scheme 2020 %   | Fund and Scheme 2019 %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Rate used to discount liabilities                          | 1.25                     | 2.08                     |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment (pre-2006 service) | 3.59                     | 3.61                     |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions (pre-2006 service)   | 3.63                     | 3.67                     |\n| Rate of general inflation (RPI)                            | 2.97                     | 3.02                     |\n| Post retirement mortality                                  |                          |                          |\n\n2020: 75% / 85% (Male/Female) (Fund) and 70% / 80% (Male/Female) (Scheme) of PCMA/PCFA 00 with improvement at CMI 2018 base date 2015, with initial improvement factor A = 0.14% / 0.19% (Male/Female) (Fund) and 0.17% / 0.26% (Male/Female), smoothing factor Sk = 7.5, long-term rates 1.5% p.a. males and 1.0% p.a. females; and tapering linearly down to nil between ages 90 and 120.\n\n2019: 75% / 85% (Male/Female) (Fund) and 70% / 80% (Male/Female) (Scheme) of PCMA/PCFA 00 with improvement at CMI 2017 base date 2015 with initial improvement factor A = 0.14% / 0.19% (Male/Female) (Fund) and 0.17% / 0.26% (Male/Female), smoothing factor Sk = 7.5, long-term rates 1.5% p.a. males and 1.0% p.a. females, and tapering linearly down to nil between ages 90 and 120.\n\nThis equates to average life expectancy as follows:\n\n|                                                                |   Fund and Scheme 2020 years |   Fund and Scheme 2019 years |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Normal retirement age                                          |                         60   |                         60   |\n| Male life expectancy at retirement age                         |                         87.5 |                         87.7 |\n| Female life expectancy at retirement age                       |                         88.8 |                         89   |\n| Male life expectancy at 20 years younger than retirement age   |                         89.6 |                         89.8 |\n| Female life expectancy at 20 years younger than retirement age |                         90.1 |                         90.4 |",

A premium of \u00a350m (2019: \u00a378m) was paid from the assets of the Fund and the Scheme to purchase these annuities. These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes and so the actuarial remeasurement recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes allowance for this premium payment as well as annuity receipts over 2020 of \u00a353m (2019: \u00a355m).\n\nThe effect on the defined benefit obligation of the Fund and Scheme of assuming reasonable alternative assumptions in isolation is shown below (net of annuities and APP). Opposite sensitivities are broadly symmetrical, but larger sensitivities are not necessarily broadly proportionate due to, for example, the existence of maxima and minima for inflation linked benefits. These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. This is unlikely in practice - for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Fund and Scheme.\n\n|                                                        | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1 year increase in longevity                           | (92)      | (78)      |\n| 0.1% decrease in the rate used to discount liabilities | (27)      | (32)      |\n| 0.1% increase in the rate of general inflation (RPI)   | (14)      | (16)      |",

The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.\n\nRepurchase agreements are valued based on the discounted cash flows expected to be paid, using an observable market interest rate, in line with the value of the underlying security.\n\nCollateral repayable on short position reverse repurchase agreements and other financial liabilities balances, including FX spots, broker and other payables, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these liabilities approximates their fair value.\n\nTrail commission represents a liability for the present value of future commission costs on distribution agreements with intermediaries, recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.

The group has elected to make use of the recognition exemptions as permitted by the standard in respect of short-term leases (lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. Such leases are not recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but the group recognises the associated lease payments as an expense over the lease term.\n\nAs a lessee, the group recognises leases on the balance sheet as 'right-of-use' assets and lease liabilities. The right-of-use assets are either classified as property, plant and equipment or investment property.\n\nThe right-of-use assets' value is initially recognised as the calculated value of the lease liabilities, initial direct costs and incentives received. The right-of-use assets are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the cost model in IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment' or as investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'. The group also assesses right-of-use assets classified as property, plant and equipment for impairment when such indicators exist.\n\nThe initial measurement of the lease liabilities is made up of the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, including fixed lease payments and excluding lease incentive receivables. The group uses the incremental borrowing rate as a discount rate for calculating the lease liabilities. The lease liabilities are unwound over the term of the lease giving rise to an interest expense. Additionally, the liabilities are reduced when lease payments are made. The group reassesses the carrying amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets if certain events occur that modify the original assumptions used to calculate the lease balances upon initial recognition.\n\nExtension and termination options are included in various leases across the group. These are generally used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the group and not by the respective lessor.\n\nThe table below describes the nature of the group's leasing activities by type of right-of-use asset recognised on balance sheet within property, plant and equipment:\u00b9\n\n| Carrying amount                      | Office   buildings 2020  \u00a3m   | IT 2020   \u00a3m   | Vehicles  2020  \u00a3m   | Total 2020   \u00a3m   | Office   buildings 2019  \u00a3m   | IT 2019   \u00a3m   | Vehicles 2019   \u00a3m   | Total 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| As at 1 January                      | 189                           | 46             | 3                    | 238               | 214                           | 58             | 5                    | 277               |\n| Additions                            | 7                             | 1              | 1                    | 9                 | 4                             | -              | -                    | 4                 |\n| Depreciation for the period          | (27)                          | (12)           | (1)                  | (40)              | (22)                          | (12)           | (2)                  | (36)              |\n| Disposals 2                          | -                             | -              | -                    | -                 | (5)                           | -              | -                    | (5)               |\n| Decrease due to currency translation | (2)                           | -              | -                    | (2)               | (2)                           | -              | -                    | (2)               |\n| As at 31 December                    | 167                           | 35             | 3                    | 205               | 189                           | 46             | 3                    | 238               |\n\n- 1.

Extension and termination options are included in various leases across the group and are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the group and not by the respective lessor.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the group had committed to no additional leases which had not yet commenced (2019: \u00a3102m).\n\nIncome from sub-leasing right-of-use assets is presented within Investment return (see Note 31).\n\n## 27 Management of capital resources Solvency II\n\nThe group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates. At a group level, Legal & General had to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).\n\nThe group calculates its Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Partial Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. Capital requirements for a few smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The group's US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis following the PRA's approval to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.\n\nThe table below shows the 'shareholder view' of the group Own Funds, Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Surplus Own Funds, based on the Partial Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP) (recalculated as at 31 December 2020 as agreed with the PRA). The TMTP incorporates estimated impacts of end December 2020 economic conditions and changes during 2020 to the Internal Model and Matching Adjustment. This is in line with group's management of the capital position on a dynamic TMTP basis.\n\nThe Solvency II results are estimated and unaudited.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, and on the above basis, the group had a surplus of \u00a37.4bn (2019: \u00a37.3bn) over its Solvency Capital Requirement, corresponding to a Solvency II capital coverage ratio on a 'shareholder view' basis of 177% (2019: 184%). The shareholder view of the Solvency II capital position is as follows:\n\n|                                  | 2020 \u00a3bn   | 2019 \u00a3bn   |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Unrestricted tier 1 Own Funds    | 12.3       | 12.4       |\n| Restricted tier 1 Own Funds\u00b9     | 0.5        | -          |\n| Tier 2 Subordinated liabilities\u00b2 | 4.5        | 3.9        |\n| Eligibility restrictions         | (0.2)      | (0.2)      |\n| Solvency II Own Funds\u00b3           | 17.1       | 16.1       |\n| Solvency Capital Requirement     | (9.7)      | (8.8)      |\n| Solvency II surplus              | 7.4        | 7. 3       |\n| SCR coverage ratio4              | 177%       | 184%       |\n\n- 1.

Tier 2 subordinated liabilities include new debt issue of \u00a30.5bn during the year.\n- 3. Solvency II Own Funds allow for a Risk Margin of \u00a36.1bn (2019: \u00a35.9bn) and TMTP of \u00a35.6bn (2019: \u00a35.7bn).\n- 4. SCR Coverage ratio is based on unrounded inputs.",

This is reflected by reducing the group's Own Funds and the group's SCR by the amount of the SCR for the final salary pension schemes.\n\nOn a 'proforma basis', which includes the contribution of the With-profits fund (2019 only) and the final salary pension schemes, the coverage ratio at 31 December 2020 is 175% (31 December 2019: 179%).\n\nOn 6 December 2017, the group announced the sale of its Mature Savings business to ReAssure Limited. ReAssure Limited assumed the economic exposure of the business from 1 January 2018 via a risk transfer agreement. The formal transfer of the business completed on 7 September 2020.

The group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.\n\n## Capital measures\n\nThe group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business. The measures used by the group include:\n\n## Accounting and Economic bases\n\nManagement use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.\n\nThe group maintains a risk-based capital model that is used to calculate the group's Economic Capital position and support the management of risk within the group. This modelling framework, suitably adjusted for regulatory constraints, also meets the needs of the Solvency II regime. Our Economic Capital model has not been reviewed by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), nor will it be.\n\n## Regulatory bases\n\nThe financial strength of the group's insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements (see below).",

        "page_content": "## Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements\n\nIn each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities. The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year. This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.\n\nThe required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance company's liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance company's liabilities and risk exposures. The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below:\n\n## Group regulatory basis\n\nThe group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements calculated using the group's Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The group capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The group's capital requirements in respect of its US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis, following PRA approval of the group's application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.\n\n## UK regulatory basis\n\nAt the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA. All material EEA insurance firms, including Legal and General Assurance Society Limited, and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited (LGIM's insurance subsidiary) are required to hold eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on an Internal Model basis. These firms, as well as the non-EEA insurance firm (Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited (LGRe) based in Bermuda), contribute over 93% of the group's SCR.\n\n## US regulatory basis\n\nRequired capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital (RBC) based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile. The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.\n\n## Bermudan regulatory basis\n\nBermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet 120% of the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR). The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework; capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying specified stresses to the assets and liabilities. The individual risk elements (excluding operational risk) are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.",

Group central expenses and debt costs are reported separately. Transactions between reportable segments are on normal commercial terms, and are included within the reported segments.\n\nContinuing operations exclude the results of the Mature Savings and the General Insurance divisions (General Insurance is in respect of 2019 only), which have been classified as discontinued following the group's announcement to sell these businesses to ReAssure Limited and Allianz respectively. The sale of the Mature Savings business completed on 7 September 2020, whilst that of the General Insurance business completed on 31 December 2019.\n\nReporting of assets and liabilities by reportable segment has not been included, as this is not information that is provided to key decision makers on a regular basis. The group's assets and liabilities are managed on a legal entity rather than reportable segment basis, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nFinancial information on the reportable segments is further broken down where relevant in order to better explain the drivers of the group's results.\n\n## (a) Profit/(loss) for the year\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2020                     | LGR \u00a3m   | LGIM \u00a3m   | LGC \u00a3m   | LGI \u00a3m   | Group  expenses and  debt costs\u00b9 \u00a3m   | Total  continuing  operations \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Operating profit/(loss) #                               | 1,731    | 404       | 275      | 189      | (415)                                 | 2,184                              |\n| Investment and other variances                          | 19       | (3)       | (299)    | (459)    | 24                                    | (718)                              |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -        | -         | -        | -        | (36)                                  | (36)                               |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 1,750    | 401       | (24)     | (270)    | (427)                                 | 1,430                              |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (230)    | (63)      | (8)      | 58       | 94                                    | (149)                              |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 1,520    | 338       | (32)     | (212)    | (333)                                 | 1,281                              |\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2019                     | LGR \u00a3m   | LGIM\u00b2 \u00a3m   | LGC \u00a3m   | LGI \u00a3m   | Group  expenses and  debt costs \u00a3m   | Total  continuing  operations \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Operating profit/(loss) #                               | 1,569    | 394        | 363      | 314      | (365)                                | 2,275                              |\n| Investment and other variances                          | 43       | (9)        | 91       | (234)    | (58)                                 | (167)                              |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -        | -          | -        | -        | (24)                                 | (24)                               |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 1,612    | 385        | 454      | 80       | (447)                                | 2,084                              |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (234)    | (75)       | (75)     | 12       | 75                                   | (297)                              |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 1,378    | 310        | 379      | 92       | (372)                                | 1,787                              |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## (ii) Revenue\n\nRevenue comprises of the following:\n\n## Net premiums earned\n\nRevenue from insurance and investment contracts has been described in section (e) of this note.\n\n## Investment return\n\nInvestment return has been described in Note 31 of this report.\n\n## Fees from fund management and investment contracts*\n\nThe group generates revenue from acting as the investment manager for clients. Fees charged on investment management services are based on the contractual fee arrangements applied to assets under management and recognised as revenue as the services are provided.\n\nThe group's income from investment contracts is primarily derived from fees for administration and managing of funds in pension plans. Revenue generated on investment contracts is recognised as services are provided. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price. In the instances of performance fees where revenue is subject to meeting a certain performance threshold, such revenue is not recognised until the condition has been met, and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of amounts would occur. Variable costs directly related to securing new contracts are capitalised and amortised over the estimated period over which the revenue is earned.\n\nTransaction fees are charged to implement trades for clients. Such fees are charged at the time the transaction takes place and are based on the size of the underlying contract.\n\n## House building*\n\nHouse building revenue arises from the sale of residential properties and land, and is recognised net of discounts and sales incentives. Sales of private houses are recognised on legal completion. Following the implementation of IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', the sale proceeds of part exchange properties are also included in revenue. Sales of social housing, where multiple units are developed and sold under a contractual agreement with a single customer, typically a housing association, are recognised over time in accordance with construction progress. Sales of land and commercial property are recognised on unconditional exchange, namely when contracts are exchanged or missives concluded and, where appropriate, construction is complete. The transaction price is determined using extensive research and expert judgement, current market values and regional variations.\n\nWarranties are provided on all properties and range from 2-10 years. Due to their features, these do not represent separate performance obligations.\n\n## Professional services fees*\n\nThe group's professional services fees revenue arises from professional services provided by employed surveyors and third party providers, panel management fees and administration fees. These fees are based on fee scales or contracts. Revenue is recognised when the service has been rendered.\n\nIn addition, the group derives professional fees from facilitation of mortgage arrangements and related products such as conveyancing. These are based on an agreement/contract and could be tiered based on volume. The obligation in such instances is satisfied on completion of the mortgage/service, at which point the revenue is recognised. There is no significant judgement applied on the timing or amount of fee recognised.\n\n## Insurance broker*\n\nFees are charged on each performance obligation offered to the customer as per agreed structure. Revenue for placement services is recognised at the point in time when the intermediary has satisfied its performance obligation, that is when the terms of the insurance policy have been agreed contractually by the insurer and policyholder, and the insurer has a present right to payment from the policyholder. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price.\n\n- *  Contracts are either expected to last one year or less, or reflect the right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. As permitted under IFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to any unsatisfied contracts is not disclosed.",

        "page_content": "## 32 Tax\n\nThe tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.\n\n## Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders\n\nThe total tax expense shown in the group's Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and shareholders. This has been apportioned between that attributable to policyholders' returns and equity holders' profits. This represents the fact that the group's long-term business in the UK pays tax on policyholder investment return, in addition to the corporation tax charge charged on shareholder profit. The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the group pays on the profits that it makes.\n\nFor this apportionment, the equity holders' tax on long-term business is estimated by applying the statutory tax rate to profits attributed to equity holders. This is considered to approximate the corporation tax attributable to shareholders as calculated under UK tax rules. The balance of income tax associated with UK long-term business is attributed to income tax attributable to policyholders' returns and approximates the corporation tax attributable to policyholders as calculated under UK tax rules.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nTax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nFor tax this includes the determination of liabilities/recoverables for uncertain tax positions and estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.\n\nAs the group operates internationally, it is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required. This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice. The directors have assessed the group's uncertain tax positions and are comfortable that the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonable possible alternative outcome in the next financial year would not have a material impact to the results of the group.\n\n## Tax rates\n\nThe table below provides a summary of the standard corporate income tax rates of the main territories we operate in.\n\n|         | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| UK      | 19.0%  | 19.0%  |\n| USA     | 21.0%  | 21.0%  |\n| Bermuda | 0.0%   | 0.0%   |\n| Ireland | 12.5%  | 12.5%  |",

The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings. Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.\n\n## (i) Description of plans\n\nThe group provides a number of equity settled share-based long-term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.\n\nThe Savings Related Share Option Plan (ShareSave) allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over three and/or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the group. The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date. Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nNil Cost Options can be granted to senior managers under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), based upon individual and company performance. Pre the 2014 award, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period was dependent on the group's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). New performance conditions attached to awards from 2014 result in the number of options that vest being equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and Earnings per Share (EPS)/Dividend per Share (DPS) growth. In addition, the awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years. Further changes were made to the performance conditions for awards granted in 2018. The number of options that vest in respect of these awards is equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and EPS growth (subject to Solvency II objectives). The majority of awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds in year three, four and five. Awards granted to executive directors and Persons Delivering Managerial Responsibilities vest after three years but any options that vest will not become exercisable until year five.\n\nThe Share Bonus Plan (SBP) awards conditional shares, restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined awards of CSOP options and nil-paid options. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends. Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments. Conditional Share awards, which include awards to executive directors, do not have voting or dividend rights.\n\nUnder the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee Share Plan (ESP), UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis. The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first \u00a320 of the employees' contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between \u00a320 and \u00a3125. There is currently no match on contributions between \u00a3125 and \u00a3150. From time to time, the group may make an award of free shares. Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years. The fair value of awarded shares is equal to the market value on award date.",

The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every five years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and the coupon payment of \u00a37m is recognised directly in equity. The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to shareholders. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the issuer at the prevailing conversion price.\n\nThe notes are treated as restricted tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.\n\n## 38 Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent third party interests in direct equity investments, including private equity, and property investment vehicles which are consolidated in the group's results.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, non-controlling interests primarily represent third party ownership in Thorpe Park Holdings, a mixed residential/commercial retail space in which the group holds 50%.\n\nThe decrease in non-controlling interests during the year primarily reflects the deconsolidation of property investment vehicles following the sale of the Mature Savings business.\n\nNo other individual non-controlling interests are considered to be material on the basis of the year end carrying value or share of profit or loss.\n\n## 39 Other liabilities\n\n|                                                               | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accruals                                                      | 410       | 431       |\n| Deferred income                                               | 2         | 49        |\n| Other                                                         | 344       | 384       |\n| Total other liabilities                                       | 756       | 864       |\n| Less: liabilities of operations classified as held for sale 1 | -         | (60)      |\n| Other liabilities                                             | 756       | 804       |\n| Due within 12 months 2                                        | 715       | 772       |\n| Due after 12 months 2                                         | 41        | 92        |\n\n- 1.

An APP is an investment contract product sold by LGR which, issued to a pension scheme, provides the scheme with a fixed or inflation linked schedule of payments to match the scheme's expected liabilities.\n\nAt inception a premium of \u00a3397m was paid by the Scheme to LGAS, and LGAS and the Scheme recognised an investment contract liability and an APP plan asset respectively of the same amount. As at 31 December 2020, LGAS recognised a liability related to the APP transaction with the Scheme of \u00a3396m which is included in the group's non-participating investment contract liabilities. The Scheme holds a transferable plan asset of the same amount which does not eliminate on consolidation.\n\n- \u00b7 Loans outstanding from related parties at 31 December 2020 of \u00a389m (2019: \u00a383m), with a further commitment of \u00a314m.\n- \u00b7 The group has total other commitments of \u00a31,207m to related parties (2019: \u00a31,213m), of which \u00a3772m has been drawn at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3749m).",

The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them. Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them. The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.\n\nVarious group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time. The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities. The provisions made are regularly reviewed. It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.\n\nGroup companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals. Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies' liabilities under the group pension fund and scheme. LGAS has provided indemnities, a liquidity and expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities liquidity facility in respect of the liabilities of group companies to facilitate the group's matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.",

In line with the requirements of IAS 12, the impact of the change in rate has not been reflected in the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2020 and will be recognised once it has been substantively enacted by the UK Parliament. The estimated impact of the change in tax rate would be an increase in the deferred tax liability of c.\u00a350m.\n\nThe Solvency II balance sheet and capital position recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the taxable differences between the IFRS and Solvency II balance sheets.

A complete list of the group's subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and significant holdings is provided in Notes 45 and 46.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benefits. Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control. The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The basis by which subsidiaries are consolidated in the group financial statements is outlined in the basis of preparation (Note 1).\n\nThe particulars of the company's subsidiaries, mutual funds and partnerships that have been consolidated as at 31 December 2020 are listed below. The main territory of operation of subsidiaries incorporated in England and Wales is the UK. For overseas subsidiaries the principal country of operation is the same as the country of incorporation. All subsidiaries have a 31 December year end reporting date and are 100% owned, unless stated otherwise. The registered office of all subsidiaries in England and Wales is One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA, United Kingdom, and in Ireland is Dillon Eustace, 33 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, unless otherwise noted. All subsidiaries are held through intermediate holding companies unless noted that they are held direct by the company. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe group reassesses the appropriateness of the consolidation of an investee whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there has been a change in the relationship between the group and the investee which affects control.",

        "page_content": "## 47 Interests in structured entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominating factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights might relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangement. The group has interests in investment vehicles which, depending upon their status, are classified as either consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities, consisting of traditional asset backed securities, together with securitisation and debentures and Collateralised Debt.\n- \u00b7 Obligations (CDOs).\n- \u00b7 Investment funds, largely being unit trusts.\n- \u00b7 Specialised investment vehicles, analysed between Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles (ICAVs), Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Societes d'Investissement a Capital Variables (SICAVs), Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF) ICAVs, and Property unit trusts.\n\nAll of the group's holdings in the above vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle's offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles. The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle, including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset based fee and a performance related incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (a) Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe group has determined that where it has control over an investment vehicle, that investment is a consolidated structured entity.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThere were no material critical accounting estimates used or judgements made by management in the preparation of these financial statements.\n\nThe following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:\n\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based Payment' (details of the number and weighted-average exercise price of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined).\n- \u00b7 The requirement of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement', where equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group.\n- \u00b7 The following paragraphs of IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements':\n- -10(d) (statement of cash flows)\n- -16 (a statement of compliance with all IFRS)\n- -38 in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) (outstanding shares comparative)\n- -38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements)\n- -38B to D (additional comparative information)\n- -111 (cash flow statement information)\n- -134 to 136 (capital management disclosures).\n- \u00b7 IAS 7, 'Statement of Cash Flows'.\n- \u00b7 IFRS 7, 'Financial Instrument Disclosures'.\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective).\n- \u00b7 The requirements in IAS 24, 'Related Party Disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group and key management compensation.\n\nThe company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 394 and 396 of the Companies Act 2006 adopting the exemption of omitting the income statement conferred by Section 408 of that Act.\n\nThe company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See Note 1 of the Group consolidated financial statements for further information on the directors' assessment of the going concern basis.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value. Subsequently, they can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification depends on two criteria:\n\n- (i) The business model within which financial assets are managed; and\n- (ii)   Their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n\nA debt instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets the following conditions:\n\n- (i) It is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- (ii) The contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\nA debt security is measured at FVOCI if it meets the following conditions:\n\n- (i) It is held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets; and\n- (ii)   The asset's cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nMovements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses and interest revenue which are recognised in the income statement. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\nAssets that are held at FVTPL include derivative assets which are held for trading (HFT) and financial assets that fail both the business model and SPPI tests. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe company has no equity instruments other than investments in subsidiaries.\n\nLoans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Company /financial statements continued\n\n## 1 Accounting policies continued\n\n## Impairment\n\nFor financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI the company reviews the carrying value of its assets at each balance sheet date. For such assets, the company determines forward looking expected credit losses (ECL), based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. In these cases, ECLs are based on the 12-month ECL, which is the ECL that results from a possible default up to 12 months after the reporting date. The company uses relevant quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on historical experience, and informed credit assessment including forward-looking information in order to evaluate the credit-worthiness of each security at each reporting date, to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination occurred. Should this be the case, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.\n\nECLs are calculated by considering the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The PD is determined by reference to third party information on available companies, or using qualitative information available to the company, and depends on whether a financial asset requires determination of a 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL. The LGD is determined with reference to any exposure reducing instruments such as collateral or liquid assets that the counterparty may have. The EAD is determined as the amount of the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date.\n\n## Investment income\n\nInvestment income includes dividends and interest. Dividends receivable from group companies are recognised in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved at the general meeting or paid. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\n## Distributions\n\nDividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the company.\n\n## Interest expense\n\nInterest expense reflects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.\n\nChanges in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.\n\nA net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates. Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Pension costs\n\nThe company participates in the group defined benefit schemes which are recognised on the Balance Sheet of Legal & General Resources Limited. These are multi-employer defined benefit schemes for which the company's share of the underlying assets and liabilities cannot be separately identified. Therefore the company's cost of participation has been treated as that of a defined contribution scheme for reporting purposes.\n\nIn addition to these schemes the company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. The company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred. Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the balance sheet.\n\nThe assets of the defined benefit schemes and the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries. The fair value of the equity instruments granted is spread over the vesting period of the instrument and treated as a capital contribution to the respective subsidiary. The total capital contribution is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The capital contribution to the subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase in the investment in the parent company's financial statements.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimate, if any, in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period. On vesting or exercise, the difference between the accumulated capital contribution and the actual cost to the company is transferred to retained earnings. Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium. Any capital contribution is subsequently recharged to the respective subsidiary as incurred and the corresponding cost of investment is reduced.\n\n## 2 Dividends\n\n|                                                            | Dividend 2020 \u00a3m   | Per share 2020 p   | Dividend 2019 \u00a3m   | Per share 2019 p   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Ordinary dividends paid and charged to equity in the year: |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| \u00b7  Final 2018 dividend paid in June 2019                   | -                  | -                  | 704                | 11.82              |\n| \u00b7  Interim 2019 dividend paid in September 2019            | -                  | -                  | 294                | 4.93               |\n| \u00b7  Final 2019 dividend paid in June 2020                   | 754                | 12.64              | -                  | -                  |\n| \u00b7  Interim 2020 dividend paid in September 2020            | 294                | 4.93               | -                  | -                  |\n| Total dividends                                            | 1,048              | 17.57              | 998                | 16.75              |\n| Ordinary share dividend proposed 1                         | 754                | 12.64              | 753                | 12.64              |\n\n## 3 Directors' emoluments and other employee information\n\nFull disclosures of Legal & General Group Plc directors' emoluments are contained within those parts of the Directors' Report on Remuneration which are described as having been audited.

The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995; the latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 was completed on 1 July 2020.\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme was, with a few exceptions (principally transfers from the Fund), closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007; the latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 was completed on 1 July 2020.\n\nThese schemes operate within the UK pensions' regulatory framework.\n\nThere were no contributions prepaid or outstanding at either 31 December 2020 or 31 December 2019 in respect of these schemes.\n\nThe Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015. The sponsoring employer is Legal & General Resources Limited and a deficit in respect of these schemes for the year ended 31 December 2020 of \u00a370m (2019: \u00a3115m) is recognised on that company's Balance Sheet.

Further details on the Subordinated borrowings of the company are provided in Note 23 of the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 13 Share capital and share premium\n\nA summary of the company's ordinary share capital, share premium and options over the company's ordinary share capital are disclosed in Note 36 of the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 14 Restricted tier 1 convertible notes\n\nOn 24 June 2020, Legal & General Group Plc issued \u00a3500m of 5.625% perpetual restricted tier 1 contingent convertible notes. The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every five years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and the coupon payment of \u00a37m is recognised directly in equity. The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to shareholders. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Issuer at the prevailing conversion price.\n\nThe notes are treated as restricted tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.",

The Company's Articles of Association were last amended at its Annual General Meeting held on 26 May 2016.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has adopted a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and these have been followed during 2020.\n\n## Powers of directors\n\nThe directors (as detailed on pages 58 and 59) may exercise all powers of the company subject to applicable legislation and regulation and the company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Appointment and replacement of directors\n\nWith regards to the appointment and replacement of directors, the company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the company or by the Board, in each case subject to the provisions of the company's Articles of Association. The company may, by way of special resolution, remove any director before the expiration of his or her period of office. The company's Articles of Association (in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code) require all the directors to retire from office at each Annual General Meeting of the company.\n\n## Share capital\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the company's issued share capital comprised 5,967,358,713 ordinary shares each with a nominal value of 2.5 pence. Details of the ordinary share capital can be found in Note 36 to the group consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, the company was granted authority by shareholders to purchase up to 596,555,907 ordinary shares, being 10% of the issued share capital of the company as at 31 March 2020. In the year to 31 December 2020, no shares were purchased by the company. This authority will expire at the 2021 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, the directors were given the power to allot shares up to an amount of \u00a349,712,992, being 33% of the issued share capital of the company as at 31 March 2020. This authority will also expire at the 2021 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nFurther resolutions are proposed, as set out in the Notice of AGM, that will, if approved by shareholders, authorise the directors to issue shares up to the equivalent of 10% of the company's issued share capital as at 31 March 2021 for cash without offering the shares first to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings.\n\nDetailed explanatory notes to these resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.\n\nOther than the above, the directors have no current intention of issuing further share capital and no issue will be made which would effectively alter control of the company without prior approval of shareholders in a general meeting.\n\n## Interests in voting rights\n\nInformation on major interests in shares provided to the company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) of the UK Listing Authority is published via a Regulatory Information Service and on the company's website: legalandgeneralgroup.com. As at 31 December 2020, the company had been advised of the following significant direct and indirect interests in the issued share capital of the company:\n\n|                | Number  of ordinary  shares of 2.5p   |   % of   capital 1 | Total   interest  in issued  share capital   |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| BlackRock Inc. | 298,315,445                           |                  5 | Indirect                                     |\n\nNo material changes to the interests have been disclosed between 31 December 2020 and 9 March 2021.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe company may, by ordinary resolution in a general meeting, declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The directors propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2020 of 12.64 pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim dividend of 4.93 pence per ordinary share paid to shareholders on 24 September 2020, will make a total dividend for the year of 17.57 pence (2019: 17.57 pence). Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 27 May 2021 to shareholders on the share register on 16 April 2021 provided that the Board of directors may cancel payment of the dividend at any time prior to payment in accordance with the Articles of Association, if it considers it necessary to do so for regulatory capital purposes.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nDetails of related party transactions are set out in Note 41 to the group consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Rights and obligations attaching to shares\n\nThe rights and obligations relating to the company's ordinary shares are set out in the Articles of Association. A copy of the Articles of Association can be requested from the Company Secretary at the company's registered office.\n\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. In a vote on a show of hands, every member present in person or every proxy present, who has been duly appointed by a member, will have one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. These rights are subject to any special terms as to voting upon which any shares may be issued or may at the relevant time be held and to any other provisions of the company's Articles of Association. Under the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association, directors have the power to suspend voting rights and, in certain circumstances, the right to receive dividends in respect of shares where the holder of those shares fails to comply with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe Board can decline to register a transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. In addition, registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules and where the number of joint holders exceeds four. The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless:\n\n- a)  the instrument of transfer is duly stamped and is left at the company's registered office or such other place as the Board may from time to time determine, accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it relates and such evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transfer or to make the transfer.\n- b)  the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; and\n- c)  the number of joint holders does not exceed four.\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, all or any of the rights attaching to an existing class of shares may be varied from time to time, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any treasury shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.\n\nShares acquired through the employee share plans rank equally with all other ordinary shares in issue. Zedra Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited, as trustee of the Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust, held 0.55% of the issued share capital of the company as at 8 March 2021 in trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior executives and employees of the group. The trustee of Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust has waived the right of that trust to receive dividends on unallocated shares it holds. The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the trustee. The trustee may vote or abstain from voting, or accept or reject any offer relating to shares, in any way it sees fit, without incurring any liability and without being required to give reasons for its decision. Under the rules of the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan (the 'Plan'), eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the company. Plan shares are held in trust for participants by Link Market Services Trustees Limited, which held 0.26% of the issued share capital of the company as at 8 March 2021. Voting rights are exercised by the trustees on receipt of the participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the trustees, no vote is registered. In addition, the trustees do not vote on any unawarded shares held under the Plan as surplus assets.\n\nThe company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are no agreements between the company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) in the event of a takeover bid, except for those relating to normal notice periods. The rules of the company's share plans contain provisions under which options and awards to participants, including executive directors, may vest on a takeover or change of control of the company or transfer of undertakings. The company has a committed \u00a31 billion bank syndicated credit facility which is terminable if revised terms cannot be agreed with the syndicate of banks in a 30-day period following a change of control. As at 9 March 2021, the company has no borrowings under this facility. There are no change of control conditions in the terms of any of the company's outstanding debt securities. The terms of the company's agreements with its banking counterparties, under which derivative transactions are undertaken, include in some instances the provision for termination of transactions upon takeover/ merger depending on the rating of the merged entity. The company does not have any other committed banking arrangements, either drawn or undrawn, which incorporate any unilateral change of control conditions.\n\n## Use of financial instruments\n\nInformation on the group's risk management process is set out on pages 40 to 47. More details on risk management and the financial instruments used are set out in Notes 16 to 18 of the group consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Indemnities\n\nThe company has agreed to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each of the directors against any liability incurred by a director in respect of acts or omissions arising in the course of their office. Qualifying pension scheme indemnities (as defined in section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) apply, to the extent permitted by law, to certain directors of the companies of the company's pension schemes. The indemnities were in force throughout 2020 and remain so. Copies of the deeds containing the relevant indemnity are available for inspection at the company's registered office and will also be available at the AGM.\n\n## Requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.4\n\nInformation to be included in the annual report and accounts under Listing Rule 9.8.4 may be found as follows:\n\n| Relevant Listing Rule   |   Page |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| LR 9.8.4R (12)          |    249 |\n| LR 9.8.4R (13)          |    249 |\n\n## Political donations\n\nNo political donations were made during 2020.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe Directors' report is prepared for the members of the company and should not be relied upon by any other party or for any other purpose. Where the Directors' report includes forward-looking statements, these are made by the directors in good faith based on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this report. Such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties underlying such forward-looking statements.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe company has arranged appropriate directors' and officers' liability insurance for directors. This is reviewed annually.",

Our policies support the employment, promotion and career development of disabled persons, as well as supporting employees who become disabled during the course of their employment. We make reasonable adjustments, as required under the Equality Act 2010, for disabled employees, including seeking redeployment in the event that reasonable adjustments are not possible. We offer appropriate training, including training in relation to equality, and will make adjustments to this training where required.\n\n## Independent auditors\n\nThe company's auditors have expressed their willingness to continue in office and the Audit Committee has recommended their reappointment to the Board. Resolutions to reappoint KPMG LLP as auditor to the company and to authorise the directors to determine their remuneration are proposed for the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nThe Directors' report on remuneration on pages 88 to 113 provides details of the interests of each director, including details of current incentive schemes and long-term incentive schemes, the interests of directors in the share capital of the company and details of their share interests, as at 9 March 2021.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Company intends to hold this year's AGM on Thursday, 20 May 2021 at 10am at the Company's offices at One Coleman Street, London, EC2R 5AA. Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting and any special arrangements that will be in place in light of the UK government's prevailing restrictions regarding Covid-19 will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts (Group and parent company), including the Directors' report on remuneration and the financial statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom (UK) Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) (UK Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosures Framework'), and applicable law. Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss of the group and the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.\n- \u00b7 State whether they have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union ('IFRSs as adopted by the EU').\n- \u00b7 Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent.\n- \u00b7 Assess the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- \u00b7 Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' report on remuneration comply with the Companies Act 2006, as regards to the group financial statements and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.\n\nThey are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.",

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.\n\n## How to avoid share fraud\n\nHave you been:\n\n- \u00b7 Contacted out of the blue.\n- \u00b7 Promised tempting returns and told the investment is safe.\n- \u00b7 Called repeatedly; or\n- \u00b7 Told the offer is only available for a limited time? If so, you might have been contacted by fraudsters.\n\n## 1.  Reject cold calls\n\nIf you've been cold called with an offer to buy or sell shares, chances are it's a high risk investment or a scam. You should treat the call with extreme caution. The safest thing to do is to hang up.\n\n## 2.  Check the firm on the FS register at fca.org.uk/register\n\nThe Financial Services Register is a public record of all the firms and individuals in the financial services industry that are regulated by the FCA.\n\n## 3.  Get impartial advice\n\nThink about getting impartial financial advice before you hand over any money. Seek advice from someone unconnected to the firm that has approached you.\n\nIf you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at fca.org.uk/ scamsmart where you can find out more about investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nIf you have lost money to investment fraud, you should report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk.\n\nIf you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Find out more at fca.org.uk/scamsmart.\n\n## General information\n\nCapital gains tax: for the purpose of calculating UK capital gains tax, the market value on 31 March 1982 of each share was 7.996 pence after adjusting for the 1986 capitalisation issue and the 1996 and 1999 sub-divisions, but not reflecting any rights taken up under the 2002 rights issue.\n\nClose company provisions: The company is not a close company within the terms of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.\n\nRegistered office: One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA.

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nAn alternative performance measure (APM) is a financial measure of historic or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined under IFRS or the regulations of Solvency II. APMs offer investors additional information on the company's performance and the financial effect of 'one-off' events and the group uses a range of these metrics to provide a better understanding of its underlying performance. The APMs used by the group are listed in this section, along with their definition/explanation, their closest IFRS measure and reference to the reconciliations to those IFRS measures.\n\n## Group adjusted operating profit\n\n## Definition\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes and exceptional items. It therefore reflects longer term economic assumptions for the group's insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGC's trading businesses (which reflects the IFRS profit before tax). Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets are reported below group adjusted operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit also excludes the yield associated with assets held for future new pension risk transfer business from the valuation discount rate. Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the period, such as mergers and acquisitions, disposals and start-up costs, are also excluded from group adjusted operating profit.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit was previously described as 'operating profit'. In order to maintain a consistent understanding of the group's performance the term 'operating profit' will continue to be used throughout the annual report and accounts as a substitute for group adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary operating profit information - section (i).\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n## Definition\n\nROE measures the return earned by shareholders on shareholder capital retained within the business. ROE is calculated as IFRS profit after tax divided by average IFRS shareholders' funds (by reference to opening and closing shareholders' funds as provided in the IFRS Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year).\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nCalculated using:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit attributable to equity holders\n- \u00b7 Equity attributable to owners of the parent\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nCalculated using profit attributable to equity holders of \u00a31,607m (2019: \u00a31,834m) and average equity attributable to the owners of the parent of \u00a39,270m (2019: \u00a38,974m).\n\n## Assets under Management\n\n## Definition\n\nFunds which are managed by our fund managers on behalf of investors. It represents the total amount of money investors have trusted with our fund managers to invest across our investment products.\n\n## Closest IFRS measures\n\n- \u00b7 Financial investments\n- \u00b7 Investment property\n- \u00b7 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 40- Reconciliation of Assets under management to Consolidated Balance Sheet financial investments, investment property and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Net release from operations\n\n## Definition\n\nRelease from operations plus new business surplus/(strain). Net release from operations was previously referred to as net cash, and includes the release of prudent margins from the back book, together with the premium received less the setup of prudent reserves and associated acquisition costs for new business.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary operating profit information - sections (i) and (ii).\n\n## Adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders\n\n## Definition\n\nThe APM measures profit before tax attributable to shareholders incorporating actual investment returns experienced during the year and the pre-tax results of discontinued operations.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary operating profit information - section (i).",

Advisory assets are beneficially owned by GIA's clients and all investment decisions pertaining to these assets are also made by the clients. These are different from Assets under Management (AUM) defined below.\n\n## Alternative performance measures (APMs)\n\nAn alternative performance measure is a financial measure of historic or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined under IFRS or the regulations of Solvency II.\n\n## Annual premium\n\nPremiums that are paid regularly over the duration of the contract such as protection policies.\n\n## Annuity\n\nRegular payments from an insurance company made for an agreed period of time (usually up to the death of the recipient) in return for either a cash lump sum or a series of premiums which the policyholder has paid to the insurance company during their working lifetime.\n\n## Assets under administration (AUA)\n\nAssets administered by Legal & General which are beneficially owned by clients and are therefore not reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Services provided in respect of assets under administration are of an administrative nature, including safekeeping, collecting investment income, settling purchase and sales transactions and record keeping.\n\n## Assets under management (AUM)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Back book acquisition\n\nNew business transacted with an insurance company which allows the business to continue to utilise Solvency II transitional measures associated with the business.\n\n## Bundled DC solution\n\nWhere investment and administration services are provided to a scheme by the same service provider. Typically, all investment and administration costs are passed onto the scheme members.\n\n## Bundled pension schemes\n\nWhere the fund manager bundles together the investment provider role and third-party administrator role, together with the role of selecting funds and providing investment education, into one proposition.\n\n## CAGR\n\nCompound annual growth rate.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nA measure of the ability of an individual, organisation or country to repay debt. The highest rating is usually AAA and the lowest Unrated. Ratings are usually issued by a credit rating agency (e.g. Moody's or Standard & Poor's) or a credit bureau.\n\n## Deduction and aggregation (D&A)\n\nA method of calculating group solvency on a Solvency II basis, whereby the assets and liabilities of certain entities are excluded from the group consolidation. The net contribution from those entities to group Own Funds is included as an asset on the group's Solvency II balance sheet. Regulatory approval has been provided to recognise the (re)insurance subsidiaries of LGI US on this basis.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme (DB scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan in which an employer/sponsor promises a specified monthly benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.\n\n## Defined contribution pension scheme (DC scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan where the pension benefits at retirement are determined by agreed levels of contributions paid into the fund by the member and employer. They provide benefits based upon the money held in each individual's plan specifically on behalf of each member. The amount in each plan at retirement will depend upon the investment returns achieved and on the member and employer contributions.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are not a separate asset class but are contracts usually giving a commitment or right to buy or sell assets on specified conditions, for example on a set date in the future and at a set price. The value of a derivative contract can vary. Derivatives can generally be used with the aim of enhancing the overall investment returns of a fund by taking on an increased risk, or they can be used with the aim of reducing the amount of risk to which a fund is exposed.\n\n## Direct investments\n\nDirect investments, which generally constitute an agreement with another party, represent an exposure to untraded and often less volatile asset classes. Direct investments also include physical assets, bilateral loans and private equity, but exclude hedge funds.\n\n## Dividend cover\n\nDividend cover measures how many times over the net release from operations in the year could have paid the full year dividend. For example, if the dividend cover is 3, this means that the net release from operations was three times the amount of dividend paid out.\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nEPS is a common financial metric which can be used to measure the profitability and strength of a company over time. It is the total shareholder profit after tax divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS uses a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary continued\n\n## Eligible Own Funds\n\nEligible Own Funds represents the capital available to cover the group's Solvency II Capital Requirement. Eligible Own Funds comprise the excess of the value of assets over liabilities, as valued on a Solvency II basis, plus high quality hybrid capital instruments, which are freely available (fungible and transferable) to absorb losses wherever they occur across the group. Eligible Own Funds (shareholder view basis) excludes the contribution to the group's solvency capital requirement of with-profits funds and final salary pension schemes.\n\n## Employee satisfaction index\n\nThe Employee satisfaction index measures the extent to which employees report that they are happy working at Legal & General. It is measured as part of our Voice surveys, which also include questions on commitment to the goals of Legal & General and the overall success of the company.\n\n## ETF\n\nLGIM's European Exchange Traded Fund platform.\n\n## Euro Commercial paper\n\nShort-term borrowings with maturities of up to 1 year typically issued for working capital purposes.\n\n## FVTPL\n\nFair value through profit or loss. A financial asset or financial liability that is measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet reports gains and losses arising from movements in fair value within the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the profit or loss for the year.\n\n## Full year dividend\n\nFull year dividend is the total dividend per share declared for the year (including interim dividend but excluding, where appropriate, any special dividend).\n\n## Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\n\nThese are a widely accepted collection of guidelines and principles, established by accounting standard setters and used by the accounting community to report financial information.\n\n## Gross written premiums (GWP)\n\nGWP is an industry measure of the life insurance premiums due and the general insurance premiums underwritten in the reporting period, before any deductions for reinsurance.\n\n## Group adjusted operating profit*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## ICAV - Irish Collective Asset-Management Vehicle\n\nA legal structure investment fund, based in Ireland and aimed at European investment funds looking for a simple, tax-efficient investment vehicle.\n\n## Index tracker (passive fund)\n\nIndex tracker funds invest in most or all of the same shares, and in a similar proportion, as the index they are tracking, for example the FTSE 100 index. Index tracker funds aim to produce a return in line with a particular market or sector, for example, Europe or technology. They are also sometimes known as 'tracker funds'.\n\n## International financial reporting standards (IFRS)\n\nThese are accounting guidelines and rules that companies and organisations follow when completing financial statements. They are designed to enable comparable reporting between companies, and they are the standards that all publicly listed groups in the UK are required to use.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nThese are measures by which the development, performance or position of the business can be measured effectively. The group Board reviews the KPIs annually and updates them where appropriate.\n\n## LGA\n\nLegal & General America.\n\n## LGAS\n\nLegal and General Assurance Society Limited.\n\n## LGC\n\nLegal & General Capital.\n\n## LGI\n\nLegal & General Insurance.\n\n## LGI new business\n\nNew business arising from new policies written on retail protection products and new deals and incremental business on group protection products.\n\n## LGIA\n\nLegal & General Insurance America.\n\n## LGIM\n\nLegal & General Investment Management.\n\n## LGR\n\nLegal & General Retirement, which includes Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI) and Legal & General Retirement Retail (LGRR).\n\n## LGR new business\n\nSingle premiums arising from annuity sales and back book acquisitions (including individual annuity and pension risk transfer), the volume of lifetime mortgage lending and the notional size of longevity insurance transactions, based on the present value of the fixed leg cash flows discounted at the LIBOR curve.\n\n## Liability driven investment (LDI)\n\nA form of investing in which the main goal is to gain sufficient assets to meet all liabilities, both current and future. This form of investing is most prominent in final salary pension plans, whose liabilities can often reach into billions of pounds for the largest of plans.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nAn equity release product aimed at people aged 60 years and over. It is a mortgage loan secured against the customer's house. Customers do not make any monthly payments and continue to own and live in their house until they move into long-term care or on death. A no negative equity guarantee exists such that if the house value on repayment is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan, any shortfall is borne by the lender.",

        "page_content": "## Matching adjustment\n\nAn adjustment to the discount rate used for annuity liabilities in Solvency II balance sheets. This adjustment reflects the fact that the profile of assets held is sufficiently well-matched to the profile of the liabilities, that those assets can be held to maturity, and that any excess return over risk-free (that is not related to defaults) can be earned regardless of asset value fluctuations after purchase.\n\n## Mortality rate\n\nRate of death, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and calculating liabilities for future policyholders of life and annuity products, which contain mortality risks.\n\n## Net release from operations*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## New business surplus/strain\n\nThe net impact of writing new business on the IFRS position, including the benefit/cost of acquiring new business and the setting up of reserves, for UK non profit annuities, workplace savings, protection and savings, net of tax. This metric provides an understanding of the impact of new contracts on the IFRS profit for the year.\n\n## Open architecture\n\nWhere a company offers investment products from a range of other companies in addition to its own products. This gives customers a wider choice of funds to invest in and access to a larger pool of money management professionals.\n\n## Overlay assets\n\nOverlay assets are derivative assets that are managed alongside the physical assets held by LGIM. These instruments include interest rate swaps, inflation swaps, equity futures and options. These are typically used to hedge risks associated with pension scheme assets during the derisking stage of the pension life cycle.\n\n## Pension risk transfer (PRT)\n\nPRT represents bulk annuities bought by entities that run final salary pension schemes to reduce their responsibilities by closing the schemes to new members and passing the assets and obligations to insurance providers.\n\n## Platform\n\nOnline services used by intermediaries and consumers to view and administer their investment portfolios. Platforms usually provide facilities for buying and selling investments (including, in the UK products such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) and life insurance) and for viewing an individual's entire portfolio to assess asset allocation and risk exposure.\n\n## Present value of future new business premiums (PVNBP)\n\nPVNBP is equivalent to total single premiums plus the discounted value of annual premiums expected to be received over the term of the contracts using the same economic and operating assumptions used for the new business value at the end of the financial period. The discounted value of longevity insurance regular premiums and quota share reinsurance single premiums are calculated on a net of reinsurance basis to enable a more representative margin figure. PVNBP therefore provides an estimate of the present value of the premiums associated with new business written in the year.\n\n## Purchased interest in long-term business (PILTB)\n\nAn estimate of the future profits that will emerge over the remaining term of life and pensions policies that have been acquired via a business combination.\n\n## Real assets\n\nReal assets encompass a wide variety of tangible debt and equity investments, primarily real estate, infrastructure and energy. They have the ability to serve as stable sources of long-term income in weak markets, while also providing capital appreciation opportunities in strong markets.\n\n## Release from operations\n\nThe expected release of IFRS surplus from in-force business for the UK non profit Insurance and Savings and LGR businesses, the shareholder's share of bonuses on with-profits business, the post-tax operating profit on other UK businesses, including the medium term expected investment return on LGC invested assets, and dividends remitted from LGA. Release from operations was previously referred to as operational cash generation.\n\n## Retirement Interest Only Mortgages\n\nA Retirement Interest Only (RIO) mortgage is a standard retirement mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term\n\nNo repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe aggregate level and types of risk a company is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities in order to achieve its business objectives.\n\n## Single premiums\n\nSingle premiums arise on the sale of new contracts where the terms of the policy do not anticipate more than one premium being paid over its lifetime, such as in individual and bulk annuity deals.\n\n## Solvency II\n\nThe Solvency II regulatory regime is a harmonised prudential framework for insurance firms in the EEA. This single market approach is based on economic principles that measure assets and liabilities to appropriately align insurers' risk with the capital they hold to safeguard the policyholders' interest.\n\n## Solvency II capital coverage ratio\n\nThe Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis divided by the group solvency capital requirement. This represents the number of times the SCR is covered by Eligible Own Funds.\n\n## Solvency II capital coverage ratio (proforma basis)\n\nThe proforma basis Solvency II SCR coverage ratio incorporates the impacts of a recalculation of the Transitional Measures for Technical Provisions and the contribution of with-profits funds and our defined benefit pension schemes in both Own Funds (2019 only) and the SCR in the calculation of the SCR coverage ratio.",

This incorporates the impacts of a recalculation of the Transitional Measures for Technical Provisions based on end of period economic conditions. The shareholder view basis does not reflect the regulatory capital position as at 31 December 2020. This will be submitted to the PRA in May 2021.\n\n## Solvency II new business contribution\n\nReflects present value at the point of sale of expected future Solvency II surplus emerging from new business written in the period using the risk discount rate applicable at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Solvency II risk margin\n\nAn additional liability required in the Solvency II balance sheet, to ensure the total value of technical provisions is equal to the current amount a (re)insurer would have to pay if it were to transfer its insurance and reinsurance obligations immediately to another (re)insurer. The value of the risk margin represents the cost of providing an amount of Eligible Own Funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement (relating to non-market risks) necessary to support the insurance and reinsurance obligations over the lifetime thereof.\n\n## Solvency II surplus\n\nThe excess of Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis over the SCR. This represents the amount of capital available to the company in excess of that required to sustain it in a 1-in-200 year risk event.\n\n## Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)\n\nThe amount of Solvency II capital required to cover the losses occurring in a 1-in-200 year risk event.\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\nTSR is a measure used to compare the performance of different companies' stocks and shares over time. It combines the share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total return to the shareholder.\n\n## Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP)\n\nThis is an adjustment to Solvency II technical provisions to bring them into line with the pre-Solvency II equivalent as at 1 January 2016 when the regulatory basis switched over, to smooth the introduction of the new regime. This will decrease linearly over the 16 years following Solvency II implementation but may be recalculated to allow for changes impacting the relevant business, subject to agreement with the PRA.\n\n## Unbundled DC solution\n\nWhen investment services and administration services are supplied by separate providers. Typically the sponsoring employer will cover administration costs and scheme members the investment costs.\n\n## With-profits funds\n\nIndividually identifiable portfolios where policyholders have a contractual right to receive additional benefits based on factors such as the performance of a pool of assets held within the fund, as a supplement to any guaranteed benefits. An insurer may either have discretion as to the timing of the allocation of those benefits to participating policyholders or may have discretion as to the timing and the amount of the additional benefits.\n\n## Yield\n\nA measure of the income received from an investment compared to the price paid for the investment. It is usually expressed as a percentage.",
