The magnitude and severity of the protracted COVID-19 pandemic induced an unimaginable economic crisis that impacted countries, economies, businesses, operations, and livelihoods worldwide.\n\nCDL was not spared. The Group reported a net loss of $1.9 billion principally due to a one-off impairment of $1.8 billion on Sincere Property Group (Sincere Property) - our joint venture (JV) investment in China. This translates to 93% of our total investment in this JV.  This investment was envisaged to be our strategic platform in the world's second largest economy. Unfortunately, several factors hindered the progress. These included the challenges imposed by the pandemic; China's unprecedented 'three red lines' policy to cap borrowings by real estate developers placed further strain on liquidity; the partnership also experienced differences in processes and operations.\n\nWith travel restrictions, border closures and a subdued outlook, the Group made impairment losses on hotels and investment properties; and allowance for foreseeable losses for development projects.\n\nExcluding these impairments and foreseeable losses, the Group would have registered a profit before tax of $120.8 million for FY 2020.\n\nThe unprecedented write-downs underscore our prudent approach to ensure that the CDL Group is unimpeded as we chart a post-COVID-19 corporate recovery.\n\nIn 2021, the Board and Management will adjust our strategies and evaluate each opportunity to overcome the challenges in this fast-evolving macro environment. With the Group's solid underlying fundamentals, a geographically diversified portfolio and a healthy balance sheet, we aim to turnaround our Group's performance going forward.\n\nThrough every crisis in the past 58 years, the Group has responded to disruptions with agility, recovered and emerged stronger. This storm is no exception, and we endeavour to sustain our track record.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RENEWAL: FORGING OUR NEXT CHAPTER OF GROWTH\n\nThe start of 2021 has brought a cautious optimism with the global rollout of vaccines and signs of improvement in pandemic containment. Cities are attempting to resume a gradual process to normalcy. Even as the full impact on recovery unfolds, our current priority is to reposition and grow our business.\n\nWhile Singapore will always be our home ground for investments, we must build a geographically diversified portfolio to weather cyclical changes and structural shifts to remain relevant. We have expanded into China (since 2010), UK (since 2013), Japan (since 2014), Australia (since 2015) and Vietnam (since 2019) for property development. We will continue to evaluate each market closely and seize opportunities as they arise. We have amassed a global portfolio with total assets amounting to $23.7 billion, with 50% of the assets in Singapore and the remaining spread across overseas markets.\n\nWe remain a sizeable owner and operator of hotels worldwide. With good progress on the vaccine programme and effective implementation of surveillance and control measures, I believe we will see the turnaround of the hospitality sector with the return of international travel. There is pent-up demand as people are eager to regain their freedom to travel. Our Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) hotels are also beginning to see green shoots in the UK, US, China and Australasia markets. Following the privatisation of M&C in late 2019 and the COVID-19 economic downturn, we restructured M&C, streamlined our operations and will continue to strengthen our management team in 2021. M&C is poised for a post-COVID recovery of its hotel operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEVEN AS THE FULL IMPACT ON RECOVERY UNFOLDS, OUR CURRENT PRIORITY IS TO REPOSITION AND GROW OUR BUSINESS, BY SEIZING THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM&C's privatisation has allowed us greater flexibility to holistically review M&C's portfolio to unlock value at the right time. While the Group is under no pressure to divest any of our hotels, we receive unsolicited offers for our assets from time to time. Some of these assets can potentially be redeveloped into alternative uses and can result in a significant gain on disposal due to the Group's generally low book costs. In the same vein, we will also continue to seek expansion opportunities in markets where we would like to establish a presence. As part of our capital recycling initiatives, the Group will explore these divestment and acquisition opportunities as they arise to enhance shareholder value.\n\nGoing forward, we will also continue to remain prudent with our non-cash and non-recurring impairments. The pandemic and unprecedented structural shifts and policy changes in China have adversely impacted Sincere Property, which continues to face liquidity challenges. A special working group, formed in December 2020, is diligently exploring all options to restructure the platform and address the liquidity issues as a priority without further financial exposure to the Group. The Board also engaged Deloitte China to assist this special task force.\n\nIn February 2021, we acquired a majority stake in Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park in China's high-growth 'Silicon Valley', a heavily negotiated deal that required much time and\n\neffort. This marked the first corporate action by the special working group. The situation remains fluid and much work is still ongoing as China's property tightening measures remain stringent.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nCOVID-19 has shaken the world and reshaped our business. Our strength and growth would not have been possible without the trust and support of all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers, business associates and partners and look forward to your continued support in our journey as we navigate through these unprecedented times.\n\nDuring the year, we bade farewell to our outgoing Directors, Mr Kwek Leng Peck, Ms Tan Yee Peng and Mr Koh Thiam Hock. We also renewed our board bench by welcoming five new Independent Non-Executive Directors - Mr Colin Ong, Mr Daniel Desbaillets, Mr Chong Yoon Chou, Ms Carol Fong and Mr Philip Lee. Each of them brings to the table different skill sets and industry experience. To our new fellow Directors, I am grateful for your strong and effective stewardship, counsel, and guidance in our endeavours to grow our Group to its fullest potential.\n\nTo our shareholders, we appreciate your confidence and support amid these challenging times. Although the Group did not declare a mid-year dividend as part of our cash preservation focus, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 8.0 cents per share as well as a special final ordinary dividend of 4.0 cents per share, bringing the total full-year dividend to 12.0 cents per share.\n\nFinally, to the Management and staff, thank you for your unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment in the past year. You have shown resilience and tenacity in navigating the unexpected business disruption. As our Group continues to expand our global footprint, we must adopt fresh perspectives, change our mindsets and harness knowledge to meet new business requirements in a globalised economy.\n\nWe have dealt with numerous challenges over the past decades. Together, I am confident that we will steer through this storm. We will glean from the lessons learnt and embrace new opportunities to emerge as an even stronger company.\n\n## KWEK LENG BENG\n\nExecutive Chairman",

In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced out of our comfort zone to adapt to the new business environment. It was a trying time but one in which we also demonstrated our resilience in the way we embraced digitalisation and seized growth opportunities.\n\nAmid the unprecedented disruption, we maintained business continuity in moving residential inventory in Singapore and abroad as well as ensured strength in our core property development and asset management divisions. We continue to build a globally diversified portfolio, enabling us to be more resilient against future storms and market shifts while tapping on various sustainable income streams to ensure strong growth prospects.\n\n## G.E.T. RENEWED\n\nSince 2018, the CDL Group has focused on shaping renewal and transformation, by repositioning our business, sharpening our value proposition and expanding our asset portfolio to deliver greater performance and superior outcomes.\n\nEven in the face of massive disruption in 2020, we continued to build on our G.E.T. ( G rowth, E nhancement and T ransformation) strategy to enhance value and drive growth through initiatives such as land replenishment, portfolio enhancement and fund management.\n\nWhile our financial performance in 2020 has been negatively skewed by non-recurring impairment costs, these figures do not reflect the reality of what the team at CDL has pulled together to achieve during an unprecedented time in modern history.\n\n## Strengthening our Pipeline\n\nIn 2020, we completed around $1.5 billion of strategic acquisitions and investments in Singapore and our key overseas markets. In Singapore, we successfully bid for a prime Government Land Sales (GLS) residential site at Irwell Bank Road in District 9, in January. The acquisition is in line with our selective land replenishment strategy and will allow us to further strengthen our presence of iconic residences within the River Valley and Grange Road area. The exclusive 540-unit luxury development named Irwell Hill Residences, designed by world-renowned architects MVRDV and ADDP, includes features and flexible spaces to cater to home-based work, reflecting the Group's agility to continually adapt our design to suit market trends.\n\nThe Group will continue to actively replenish our land bank through the GLS programme or selective private acquisitions\n\nto ensure a stable launch pipeline, while strengthening our recurring income streams through strategic acquisitions of commercial assets or Private Rented Sector (PRS) projects.\n\n## Portfolio Enhancement Strategy\n\nAsset rejuvenation and portfolio enhancement are key pillars of our G.E.T. strategy. The Group is tirelessly exploring ways to derive more value from our substantial asset portfolio, including asset repositioning, divestment, Asset Enhancement Initiatives (AEIs) as well as suitable redevelopment opportunities.\n\nOne example of asset repositioning is the $70 million AEI of Republic Plaza (RP), our flagship commercial property. Apart from infrastructural upgrades, which included a substantial makeover of RP's main lobby with a 1,800 sq ft digital wall, a refreshed retail enclave housing close to 40 F&B and retail outlets and innovative features such as the CityNexus smart building mobile app in 2019, we introduced a first-of-its-kind contactless lift eCall solution in 2020. We also completed a functional upgrade of City Industrial Building last year and have embarked on upgrading works for Cideco Industrial Complex, which is slated for completion in 2021. These AEIs drive operational efficiency and strengthen recurring incomes.\n\nThe Singapore Government is implementing efforts to rejuvenate the city centre, providing enhanced plot ratios for older assets in the Central Business District (CBD). The depth of our commercial property portfolio - carried at low historical costs - provides unparalleled opportunities for us to replenish our land bank and reimagine the cityscape.\n\nThe Group is progressing with plans to redevelop Fuji Xerox Towers and Central Mall assets under the CBD Incentive Scheme and Strategic Development Incentive Scheme respectively to unlock value in these assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GROWTH\n\nBuild a development pipeline and recurring income streams\n\nEnhance asset portfolio and drive operational efficiency\n\nThe proposed redevelopment of Fuji Xerox Towers - into a 47-storey mixed-used integrated project with office, retail, residential and serviced apartments - can yield a potential uplift in the Gross Floor Area (GFA) by 25% to approximately 655,000 square feet (sq ft). Similarly, we plan to redevelop Central Mall into a mixed-use development comprising office, retail, serviced apartments and hotel components to realise a potential increase in GFA.\n\n## The Next Chapter of Transformation\n\nTo keep pace with macroeconomic changes and stay relevant, we must continue to expand our horizons and transform our business. Since we privatised Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) in late 2019, the hotel group has enjoyed greater flexibility in navigating the changes to the hospitality sector. This has been especially evident given the challenges posed by the pandemic. M&C's focus has been to improve operations and efficiency via better management of hotels as well as the repositioning of assets to unlock value.\n\nIn 2020, the Group divested three non-core hotel assets Millennium Cincinnati in the US, Copthorne Hotel Birmingham in the UK and Copthorne Orchid Hotel & Resort Penang in Malaysia - which brought a combined sales value of $104.8 million and pre-tax divestment gains for CDL of $50.3 million. The divestments are in line with the Group's strategy to extract value from non-core hotel assets, streamline our portfolio and recycle capital, especially after the onset of the pandemic.\n\nApart from the disposal of non-core hotel assets, the Group's strategies to unlock value also include the option to facilitate the acquisition of hotels by CDL Hospitality Trusts, such as the divestment of W Singapore - Sentosa Cove for $324 million in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, we made a painful decision to substantially write-down our strategic investment in Sincere Property, which severely distorted our financial results for the year. Although the terms were favourable at the point when we entered in the deal, circumstances changed significantly thereafter, triggered principally by the prolonged pandemic and unprecedented policy shifts in China. These adversely impacted Sincere Property's operating conditions. Despite the challenges, we must continue to focus on our path of recovery.\n\nThe Group is well-positioned to address near-term challenges and opportunities following the COVID-19 crisis. One such recent initiative saw us acquiring a business park under development in Shenzhen from Sincere Property to improve the liquidity of our joint venture investment in China. We are also constantly refining our strategy, reinforcing our frameworks and future-proofing our business.\n\nThe pandemic has transformed the way we live, work, play and interact. Homes must be multifunctional and conducive to working and studying while workspaces must be adaptive to accommodate safe distancing requirements. To cater to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvarious needs under the new norm, we have been designing our spaces with greater flexibility, efficiency and wellness in mind.\n\n## STANDING TOGETHER\n\nAmid the tough times, we provided support for our tenants, vulnerable individuals, families and communities affected by the pandemic. To help our tenants tide through the crisis in Singapore and overseas in 2020, we provided rental relief totalling over $40 million in property tax and rental rebates. For the community, CDL, together with contributions from our entire Board and the Executive team, donated $400,000 to The Invictus Fund administered by Singapore's Community Chest. We also made a donation to migrant workers at our local development projects, in a dollar-for-dollar match for contributions made by CDL employees, to provide them with necessities during the circuit breaker period in Singapore.\n\nOn the hospitality front, M&C rolled out support programmes to public health authorities and frontline personnel in the UK, US, China, New Zealand and Singapore. M&C's 'We Clean. We Care. We Welcome.' global campaign also included initiatives to ensure guests enjoy a pleasant and safe hospitality experience.\n\nWhile recovery from this crisis is likely to remain patchy with resurgence of infections around the world and concerns about imported cases, we will continue to keep a strong, positive and resilient mindset.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nOn behalf of Senior Management, I wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders, customers, business associates and partners for your unwavering support throughout the harsh year. We are also thankful to our Board of Directors for their invaluable guidance and counsel.\n\nTo our employees, your tireless dedication and efforts amid the challenges of COVID-19 while executing our strategic initiatives have helped the Group to overcome unprecedented market turbulence and fortified our foundations for sustained growth and recovery in the years ahead. Thank you for standing together during this difficult period.\n\nAs  we  continue  to  push  hard,  innovate  and  deliver value to all our stakeholders, we will strengthen our operational resilience and together, we are confident of emerging stronger.\n\n## SHERMAN KWEK\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company has established various corporate policies as necessary which provide a communicable and understandable framework for employees to observe the Company's principles on honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in their relationships with the Company's stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and employees. Further details of these policies are described in the segment entitled 'Corporate Values and Conduct of Business' at the end of this report.\n\n## Board Orientation and Training (Provision 1.2)\n\nEach newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislations and regulations. The new Director will also receive an electronic induction pack containing information and documents relating to the roles, duties and responsibilities of a director (and where applicable, as a member of the Committees), the Group's principal businesses, the Company's Board processes and corporate governance practices, relevant Company policies and procedures as well as a board meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting of the Board and where applicable, the Committees.\n\nThe Company also conducts a comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors pursuant to their appointments to any of the Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group's principal businesses, the Company's governance practices  and  processes,  internal  controls  and  risk management systems, their responsibilities as directors and in the case of appointments to any of the Committees, the roles and areas of responsibilities of such Committees. The induction programme includes meetings with various key executives of the Management to allow the new Directors to be acquainted with the Management team and to facilitate their independent access to the Management team in future. The programme also includes briefings by the Management team on key areas of the Company's operations.\n\nFor a first-time Director who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company, in addition to the induction as detailed above, he or she will be required to also attend certain specific modules of the Listed Entity Director ('LED') Programme conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors ('SID') in order to acquire relevant knowledge of what is expected of a listed company director, this being a mandatory requirement under the SGX-ST Listing Rules. Completion of the LED Programme, which focuses on comprehensive training of company directors on compliance, regulatory and corporate governance matters, should provide the first-time Director with a broad understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company under the requirements of the Companies Act, Chapter 50, the Listing Manual of SGX-ST ('Listing Manual') and the 2018 Code.\n\nThree Directors resigned from the Board in 2020, namely Mr Kwek Leng Peck, a non-executive non-independent Director, and Mr Koh Thiam Hock and Ms Tan Yee Peng, both independent Directors. Between October 2020 and January 2021, five new independent non-executive Directors ('INEDs'), namely Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin, Mr Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets, Mr Chong Yoon Chou, Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina and Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, were appointed.\n\nThe Directors are also provided with updates and/or briefings from time to time by professional advisers, auditors, the Management and the Company Secretaries in areas such as directors' duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices, relevant legislations and regulations, risk management and financial reporting standards. The Directors are also regularly kept informed by the Company Secretaries of the availability of appropriate courses, conferences and seminars including those conducted by the SID, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such training at the Company's expense. The NC and the Board are kept informed of the trainings attended by the Directors during the year. As part of the NC's annual assessment of the skills set of the Board and the Committees, the NC will also recommend further training for the Directors in specific areas, if so required, to supplement the regular updates/briefings provided to the Directors from time to time.\n\nDuring the year, some of the trainings attended by the Directors included the ACRA-SGX-SID Audit Committee Seminar 2020, SID Directors Conference 2020, SID Corporate Governance Roundup 2020, briefings by SID, audit professionals and other consultants in relation to audit committee matters, remuneration committee matters, risk management matters, and topics relating to data protection and cyber security.\n\nIn addition, in-house seminars were also organised in 2020 and conducted by invited external speakers on the following topics:\n\n- 1. Emerging Technology: Innovation, future of work and cyber\n- 2. Geopolitical Risk Landscape\n- 3. ESG Integration: A Pathway to Business Resilience\n\nMembers of the Audit & Risk Committee ('ARC') were also provided with regular briefings from the Company's external auditors on applicable Accounting Standards and Tax Updates during the year.\n\nIn addition to the training courses/programmes and briefing updates, Directors are also at liberty to approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company's operations.\n\n## 83.33% of the Board attended various training seminars and workshops in 2020\n\n## Accounted for more than 86.55 training hours in aggregate\n\n## Board Approval (Provision 1.3)\n\nKey matters which are specifically reserved for approval by the Board include the decisions over the strategic direction, plans and performance objectives of the Group (including its risk appetite); the Group's financial objectives and annual budget; decisions to commence, discontinue or modify significantly any business activity or to enter into or withdraw from a particular market sector which have or may have material impact on the profitability or performance of the Group; corporate or financial restructuring; major funding and investment proposals; decisions over new borrowings or significant amendments to the terms and conditions of existing borrowings other than in the ordinary course of business; adoption of key corporate policies and corporate governance practices and any other matters which require the Board's approval as prescribed under the relevant legislations and regulations as well as the provisions of the Company's Constitution. All issuance of the Group's financial results requires the approval of the Board, including decisions with regard to the Company's dividend policy and payouts.\n\nAligned with the Company's strategy to develop growth platforms in Singapore and key international markets, the Board has put in place an approval matrix with established authority limits in connection with the acquisitions and divestments of the Group's investments for its property development, property investment, asset management and fund management platforms. The approved matrix is revised and updated when necessary, in line with the Group's strategic objectives.\n\nManagement is fully apprised of such matters which require the approval of the Board or the Committees. For operational efficiency, the Company also has a structured approval limits\n\nmatrix which sets out the delegated authority to various levels of Management to approve operating expenditure below the thresholds requiring the Board's approval.\n\n## Delegation by the Board (Provision 1.4)\n\nThe primary functions of the Board are either carried out directly by the Board or delegated to the Committees with clear written terms of reference setting out their compositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board. The Committees established by the Board are the ARC, the NC, the Remuneration Committee ('RC'), the Board Sustainability Committee ('BSC') and the Board Committee ('BC'), all collectively referred to hereafter as the 'Committees'.\n\nEach Committee reports key matters to the Board at Board Meetings and submit its report at least on an annual basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n=\n\nAll terms of reference for the Committees are approved by the Board and reviewed annually to ensure their continued relevance, taking into account the changes in the governance and legal environment.\n\nThe delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees enables the Board to achieve operational efficiency by empowering these Committees to decide, review and make recommendations on matters within their respective written terms of reference and/or limits of delegated authority, without abdicating the Board's overall responsibility.\n\nThe BC comprises five Directors with the majority of its members being non-executive. The BC's principal responsibility is to assist the Board in the discharge of its duties which include, in particular, routine and operational matters, namely assisting the Board in approving banking-related matters such as the opening, closing and maintenance of banking accounts of the Company and the acceptance of up to certain limits of banking facilities extended to the Company, operational matters relating to property development activities and other matters determined by the Board from time to time.\n\nPlease refer to the sections on Principles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 in this report for further information on the activities of the NC, RC and ARC. Information on the activities of the BSC can be found under the 'Sustainability' segment towards the end of this report.\n\n## Board and Board Committees Meetings (Provision 1.5)\n\nMeetings of the Board and Committees are held regularly, with the Board meeting no less than four times a year. Nine Board meetings were held in 2020. At the regular Board meetings,",

Of the four scheduled meetings, two are half-yearly Board meetings, and two are scheduled primarily for the Board to focus on the review of the Company's strategic direction, including specific business strategies, business segmental and geographical allocation of assets, and risk appetite and tolerance limits, where applicable.\n\nOne meeting of the non-executive Directors ('NEDs') and two meetings of the Independent Directors ('IDs'), duly chaired by the Lead Independent Director ('Lead ID'), were held in 2020. Meetings of the NEDs and IDs are convened as often as may be warranted by circumstances. The IDs also meet regularly under the various Committees and the Lead ID is a member in some of these Committees.\n\nThe proposed meetings for the Board and all Committees for each new calendar year are set out in a schedule of meetings, which is notified to all Board members before the start of that calendar year. Additional meetings are convened as and when circumstances warrant. Records of all such meetings, including discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken, are maintained by the Company Secretaries. The Company's Constitution allows for the meetings of its\n\nBoard and the Committees to be held via teleconferencing and videoconferencing. The Board and the Committees may also make decisions by way of circulating written resolutions.\n\nThe attendance of the Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Company ('AGM') and meetings of the Board and the Committees, as well as the frequency of such meetings in 2020, is disclosed in the table below. Directors who were unable to attend any meetings of the Board or the Committees, were provided with the meeting materials and encouraged to raise discussion points or queries with the Board Chairman or respective Committee chairman or the Management. Nonetheless, the Board is of the view that the contribution of each Director should not be focused solely on his/her attendance at meetings of the Board and/or the Committees. A Director's contribution should also extend beyond the confines of the formal environment of such meetings, through the sharing of views, advice, experience and strategic networking relationships which would further the interests of the Company. The Directors also, whether individually or collectively, engage with the Management, heads of the Group's business units and departments and the Group's external consultants in order to better understand the challenges faced by the Group and the input of the Directors, through such engagement, provide invaluable perspective to the Management.\n\n## Directors' Attendance at the AGM, and Meetings of the Board, the Committees, the IDs and the NEDs in 2020 (Provision 1.5)\n\n|                                       | Board                               | ARC                                 | NC                                  | RC                                  | BSC                                 | NEDs                                | IDs                                 | AGM                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Number of meetings held in 2020       | 9                                   | 10                                  | 4                                   | 3                                   | 2                                   | 1                                   | 2                                   | 1                                   |\n| Name of Directors                     | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 | Number of meetings attended in 2020 |\n| Kwek Leng Beng (1)                    | 9/9                                 | N.A.                                | 4/4                                 | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 |\n| Kwek Leng Peck (4)                    | 6/7 (4)                             | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 |\n| Sherman Kwek Eik Tse                  | 9/9                                 | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 |\n| Lim Yin Nee Jenny (1)                 | 9/9                                 | 10/10                               | 4/4                                 | 3/3                                 | N.A.                                | 1/1                                 | 2/2                                 | 1/1                                 |\n| Philip Yeo Liat Kok (1)               | 8/9 (2)                             | N.A.                                | 4/4                                 | 3/3                                 | 2/2                                 | 1/1                                 | 1/2 (3)                             | 1/1                                 |\n| Tan Poay Seng                         | 9/9                                 | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | 1/1                                 | 2/2                                 | 1/1                                 |\n| Ong Lian Jin Colin (7)                | 3/3 (7)                             | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.

The AGM was held via electronic means.\n- (2) Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok was unable to attend one Board meeting for medical reasons.\n- (3) Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok was unable to attend one IDs' Meeting as he had prior engagement.\n- (4) Mr Kwek Leng Peck resigned as a Director on 19 October 2020.\n- (5) Mr Koh Thiam Hock resigned as a Director on 28 December 2020.\n- (6) Ms Tan Yee Peng resigned as a Director on 30 December 2020.\n- (7) Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin was appointed as a Director on 7 October 2020 and a member of the RC on 29 December 2020.\n- (8) Mr Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets was appointed as a Director on 20 November 2020.\n- (9) Mr Chong Yoon Chou was appointed as a Director on 20 November 2020 and a member of the ARC on 29 December 2020. He was invited to attend one ARC meeting prior to his appointment to the ARC.\n- (10) Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina was appointed as a Director and a member of the RC on 29 December 2020.\n\n## Directors' Multiple Board Representations and Time Commitments (Provision 1.5)\n\nWhen considering the re-nomination of Directors for reelection, the NC considers the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple board representations and/or other principal commitments. An analysis of the directorships (which includes directorships by groups and executive appointments) held by the Directors is reviewed annually by the NC. Each Director is also required to confirm annually to the NC as to whether he or she has any issue with competing time commitments which may impact his or her ability to provide sufficient time and attention to his or her duties as a Director of the Company. Based on the analysis, the Directors' annual confirmation and the Directors' commitments and contributions to the Company which are also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Board and Committee meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nThe NC noted that, excluding the directorship held in the Company, the number of listed company board representations currently held by each of the Directors ranged from one to three in number and those held by Mr Kwek Leng Beng are on the boards of the related companies of the Company. The NC has recommended that the maximum number of listed company board representations which each Director of the Company may hold be set at six (6), with a view to providing a guide to address potential competing time commitments that may be faced by Directors serving on multiple listed company boards. The NC may review this guideline from time to time and will also consider the circumstances of individual Directors or potential candidates with multiple listed company directorships above the recommended number to determine their capacity to participate and contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nA policy has also been put in place for Directors to consult the Board Chairman or the chairman of the NC with regard to accepting any new listed company board appointment or principal commitment and notifying the Board of any changes in their external appointments. This would allow the Director to review his or her time commitments with the proposed new appointment and in the case of an independent Director, to also ensure that his or her independence would not be affected.\n\n## Complete, Adequate and Timely Information (Provision 1.6)\n\nPrior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by the Management, containing complete, adequate and timely information to enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings. The Management is in attendance at such meetings,\n\nwhilst the Company's auditors and professional advisers who can provide additional insight into the matters for discussion are invited from time to time to attend the relevant meetings. The Management also provides all Directors with monthly updates on the Company's financial performance including an analysis of the same, with material variances between the comparative periods disclosed and explained. Where the Board's or a Committee's approval is sought, relevant background and explanatory information on the specific matter is provided to enable Directors to understand the issues and to request for further information, as necessary.\n\nDraft agendas for Board and Committee meetings are circulated in advance to the Board Chairman and the Committee Chairman respectively, for them to review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and the Committees are also furnished routine reports, where applicable, from the Management. The Chairman of the ARC, NC, RC and BSC provides an annual report of the respective Committees' activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of meetings of the Committees are circulated to all Board members.\n\n## Access to Management, Company Secretaries and Independent Professional Advice (Provision 1.7)\n\nAll Directors have direct and independent access to the Management. To facilitate this access, all Directors are provided the contact details of the Key Management Personnel and other senior management team members. The contact details of the heads of internal audit and risk management are also provided to the ARC.\n\nThe Directors, whether as a group or individually, are entitled to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and where circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek such independent professional advice.\n\nThe Company Secretaries, whose appointment and removal are subject to the Board's approval, attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees to provide guidance for Board procedures to be followed. The Company Secretaries, together with the Management, also ensure that the Company complies with applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with the Management, the Company Secretaries also advise the Board Chairman, the Board and the Committees on corporate governance matters and assist to implement and strengthen corporate governance practices and processes, including ensuring good information flow within the Board and the Committees and between the Directors and Management, facilitating the induction for newly appointed Directors and newly appointed Committee members, and assisting in the",

On an on-going basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries.\n\n## Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance\n\n## Board Independence (Provisions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)\n\nThe Board currently comprises ten members. All members of the Board, except for the Board Chairman and the Group CEO, are INEDs. Based on the NC's recommendation, the Board has determined eight of them, being more than half of the Board, to be independent ('8 IDs'), thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board capable of exercising objective judgement on the corporate affairs of the Company. No individual or small group of individuals dominate the Board's decision-making. No alternate Directors have been appointed in respect of any of the Directors.\n\nWhen reviewing the independence of the 8 IDs, the NC has considered the applicable SGX Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and the guidelines for independence set out in Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code. As part of the consideration, the NC also took into account the 8 IDs' other directorships, annual declarations regarding their independence, disclosures of interest in transactions in which they have a direct/indirect interest, their ability to avoid any apparent conflicts of interests especially by abstaining from deliberation on such transactions and their ability to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company.\n\nThe 8 IDs are Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny, Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok, Mr Tan Poay Seng, Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin, Mr Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets, Mr Chong Yoon Chou, Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina and Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip. In accordance with SGX Listing Rule 210(5)(d), none of the 8 IDs are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations. None of the 8 IDs have immediate family members who are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations, and whose remuneration is determined by the RC. For purposes of determining independence, the 8 IDs have also provided confirmation that they are not related to the Directors or to any shareholders holding 5% interest in the Company. The NC is satisfied that there is no other relationship which could affect their independence. The Directors undertook a review of their independence, with each ID abstaining from participating in his/her own review by the Board and had concurred with the NC's determination of the independence of the 8 IDs.\n\nMr Philip Yeo Liat Kok and Mr Tan Poay Seng would be due to retire by rotation at the forthcoming AGM to be held in April 2021 ('2021 AGM'). Both Mr Yeo and Mr Tan have served more than nine years on the Board since their appointments as Directors on 11 May 2009 and 2 February 2012 respectively. Mr Tan has informed the Board of his intention to step down as Director upon the conclusion of the 2021 AGM. The Board extends its appreciation to Mr Tan for his dedicated service and contribution to the Board. As recommended by the NC and approved by the Board, with Mr Yeo abstaining from voting at the NC and Board, Mr Yeo has agreed to stay on as an ID until no later than 31 December 2021 and will accordingly seek re-election at the 2021 AGM. This is to maintain a balance of current IDs and the new IDs on the Board.\n\n## Board Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)\n\n## Board Diversity Pledge\n\nThe Board welcomes the push for greater diversity in the boardroom which can provide a more diverse approach to business decision-making and the Company had, on 28 August 2015, supported the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by SID and SGX-ST where the Company pledged its commitment to promote 'diversity as a key attribute of a well-functioning and effective Board' and shared the view 'that a diverse Board will enhance decision making by harnessing the variety of skills, industry and business experiences, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service, and other distinguishing qualities of the members of the Board.'\n\nThe NC reviews the size and composition mix of the Board and the Committees annually. At the recommendation of the NC, the Board had already adopted in 2017 a formal Board Diversity Policy, setting out its policy and framework for promoting diversity on the Board. The Board Diversity Policy is available on the Company's corporate website. The Board recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the Company's achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decision-making process of the Board through the perspectives derived from the various skills, business experience, industry discipline, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service and other distinguishing qualities of the Directors.\n\nWhen reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board and making recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors, the NC will consider all aspects of diversity in order to arrive at an optimum balanced composition of the Board.\n\nThe Board has adopted the NC's initial recommended target to achieve a level of at least 20% female representation on its Board by 2020. With Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny and Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina on the Board, it has continued to achieve its target of 20% female representation.\n\nThe NC noted the recommendation of the Council for Board Diversity for listed companies to have 25% female representation on their boards by 2025 and 30% by 2030. In this regard, the NC will try to ensure that:\n\n- (a)  if external search consultants are used to search for candidates for Board appointments, the brief will include a requirement to present female candidates;\n- (b)  when seeking to identify a new Director for appointment to the Board, the NC will request female candidates to be fielded for consideration;\n- (c)  female representation on the Board be continually improved over time based on the set objectives of the Board; and\n- (d)  at least one female Director continues to be appointed to the NC.\n\nThe final decision on the selection of Directors will be based on merits against objective criteria that complement and expand the skills and experience of the Board as a whole, and having regard to the overall balance and effectiveness of a diverse Board.\n\nThe Board currently comprises business leaders and professionals with real estate, hospitality, financial (including audit, accounting, tax and investment), legal, risk management, fund management and business management qualifications and backgrounds. When reviewing candidates for future Board appointment, the NC will be considering candidates from other disciplines e.g. legal, private equity and information technology, in order to provide more diverse viewpoints and introduce additional skills set to the Board.\n\nThe Board has two female members, and Directors with ages ranging from early-50s to 80 years old, who have served on the Board for different tenures. The members of the Board with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group's business and direction. Further information on the individual Directors' background, experience and skills can be found in the 'Board of Directors' section in the Annual Report 2020 ('AR').\n\n## Board Composition, Diversity and Balance\n\n## Independence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender Diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' Age Group\n\nAs of 7 April 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independent Directors' Length of Service\n\nAs of 7 April 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board will however continue to review opportunities to refresh the Board with a view to expanding the skills, experience and diversity of the Board as a whole.\n\n## NEDs' Participation (Provision 2.5)\n\nNEDs are encouraged to participate actively at Board meetings in the development of the Company's strategic plans and direction, and in the review and monitoring of Management's performance against targets. To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Company's businesses and performance through monthly reports from the Management and have unrestricted access to the Management. They also sit on various Committees established by the Board to provide unbiased and independent views, constructive input and the independent review and monitoring of performance of the Company and Management. One meeting of the NEDs and two meetings of the IDs, chaired by the Lead ID, were held in 2020 without the presence of Management. The NEDs/IDs would also confer among themselves without the presence of Management as and when the need arose. The Lead ID collates the feedback from the NEDs/IDs and communicates the same to the Board and/or the Board Chairman as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roles of the Executive Chairman and the Group Chief\n\n## Executive Officer (Provisions 3.1 and 3.2)\n\nThe roles of Chairman of the Board and the Group CEO are separate to ensure a clear division of responsibilities and increased accountability.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, is also the Executive Chairman. Mr Kwek Leng Beng plays an instrumental role in providing the Company with strong leadership and vision, leading the Board in its review of the Group's strategies for sustainable growth. As the Board\n\nChairman with written terms of reference approved by the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng also promotes and leads the Group in its commitment to achieve and maintain high standards of corporate governance. He bears primary responsibility for the workings of the Board, by ensuring effectiveness in all aspects of its role including setting the agenda for Board meetings with input from Management, ensuring sufficient allocation of time for thorough discussion of key agenda items at Board meetings, promoting an open environment within the Boardroom for constructive debate, encouraging the NEDs to speak freely and contribute effectively, and exercising control over the quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management. At AGMs and other shareholders' meetings, he plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and Management.\n\nAs Executive Chairman, he is the most senior executive in the Company and bears overall executive responsibility for the Group's business. Mr Kwek Leng Beng is assisted by the Group CEO, Mr Sherman Kwek. The Group CEO leads the members of the Management team and is responsible for implementing and reviewing the business direction and strategies for the Group as endorsed by the Board, and for operational performance and organisational excellence. He is the elder son of the Executive Chairman.\n\nThe Board has considered Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Board Chairman and the strengths he brings to such a role by virtue of his stature and experience. Through the establishment of various Committees with power and authority to perform key functions without the undue influence from the Board Chairman, and the putting in place of internal controls for proper accountability and to allow for effective oversight by the Board of the Company's business, the Board ensures that there is appropriate balance of power which allows the Board to exercise objective decision-making in the best interests of the Company. The Board is of the view that Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Board Chairman would continue to facilitate the Group's decision-making and implementation process without diminishing the capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.\n\n## Lead Independent Director (Provision 3.3)\n\nTaking cognisance that the Board Chairman is an Executive Director and thus not independent, the Board has designated a Lead Independent Director who serves as a sounding board for the Board Chairman and also as an intermediary between the NEDs/IDs and the Board Chairman. The current Lead ID is Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny. The role of the Lead ID is set out in the written terms of reference for the Lead ID, which have been approved by the Board. The Lead ID is available to shareholders\n\nshould they have concerns which cannot be resolved or are inappropriate to raise through the normal communication channels of the Board Chairman or the Management. No query or request on any matter which requires the Lead ID's attention was received from shareholders in 2020. Under the chairmanship of the Lead ID, a meeting of the NEDs and two meetings of the IDs were convened in 2020 without the presence of Management or the Board Chairman, and the views expressed by the NEDs and IDs at these meetings were communicated by the Lead ID to the Board Chairman and the Management, as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 4: Board Membership\n\n## NC Composition and Role (Provisions 4.1 and 4.2)\n\nFour out of the five members of the NC, including the NC chairman, are independent Directors. The Lead ID is one of the independent members of the NC.\n\nThe NC's responsibilities as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are to examine Board size, review all Board and Committees composition and membership, board succession plans for the Directors (including the Board Chairman) and the Key Management Personnel, determine each Director's independence annually and as and when circumstances require, evaluate performance of the Board as a whole, its Committees and the individual Directors, review appointments and re-appointment of Directors (including alternate directors, if any) and the reasons for resignations of Directors, review appointments and the reasons for resignations and terminations of the Executive Chairman and the Key Management Personnel which includes the Group CEO, the Group General Manager ('Group GM'), the Group Chief Strategy Officer ('Group CSO'), the Group Chief Investment Officer ('Group CIO') and the Group Chief Financial Officer ('Group CFO'), review and confirm the induction programmes for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors in respect of their appointments to any of the Committees and review the training and continuous professional development programme for the Directors. Four NC meetings were held in 2020. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all NC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the NC conducted a selfassessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('NC Self-Assessment Checklist'). The NC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia, the responsibilities of the NC under its terms of reference and considered also the contributions of NC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at NC meetings.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the NC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Re-Nomination of Directors and Determination of Independence (Provisions 4.3 and 4.4)\n\nThe NC reviews annually the nomination of the relevant Directors for re-election as well as the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-election, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board (which includes their participation and candour at Board and Committee meetings) as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations and/or other principal commitments, and also reviews their independence having regard to the provisions in the applicable SGX Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code. The recommendation of the NC on the annual nomination of the Directors for re-election is submitted to the Board for decision and thereafter tabled at the AGM of the Company for consideration and approval by shareholders.\n\nThe Constitution of the Company provides that not less than one-third of the Directors for the time being, shall retire as Directors at each AGM. All new Directors appointed by the Board shall hold office until the next AGM and are eligible for re-election at the said AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Company, Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok and Mr Tan Poay Seng are due to retire by rotation at the 2021 AGM. Mr Tan had indicated that he will not be seeking re-election at the 2021 AGM. Mr Yeo agreed to offer himself for re-election at the 2021 AGM but would step down as a Director no later than 31 December 2021. Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin, Mr Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets, Mr Chong Yoon Chou, Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina and Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, being Directors who were appointed by the Board prior to the 2021 AGM ('New Directors') , will also retire and have offered themselves for re-election at the 2021 AGM. The NC has considered the contribution and performance of Mr Yeo and the New Directors and recommended to the Board to nominate their re-election at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors (Provision 4.3)\n\nThe NC interviews shortlisted candidates before formally considering and recommending them for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to the Committees. Searches for potential candidates generally take into account recommendations from the Directors and various other sources, including candidates which may be suggested by SID, the Council for Board Diversity and other relevant organisations. Should it be necessary, the NC may consider",

Shortlisted candidates would be required to furnish their curriculum vitae containing information on their academic/ professional qualification, work experience, employment history and experience (if any) as directors of listed companies.\n\nIn reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director appointments, the NC considers:\n\n- (a)  the candidate's track record, experience and capabilities or such other factors including age and gender, as may be determined by the NC to be relevant and which would contribute to the Board's collective skills;\n- (b)  any competing time commitments if the candidate has multiple listed company board representations and/or other principal commitments;\n- (c)  the  candidate's  independence,  in  the  case  of  the appointment of an independent NED; and\n- (d)  the  composition  requirements  for  the  Board  and Committees after matching the candidate's skills set to the requirement of the relevant Committees (if the candidate is proposed to be appointed to any of the Committees).\n\n## Key Information on Directors (Provision 4.5)\n\nPlease refer to the 'Board of Directors' section in the AR for key information on the Directors, including their date of first appointment and latest re-appointment to the Board, their academic/professional qualification, major appointments/ principal commitments, directorships held in listed companies both currently and in the preceding five years, and other relevant information; Additional Information on Directors seeking re-election at the 58th Annual General Meeting'; and the Notice of AGM for information on Directors proposed for re-election at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Succession Planning for the Board, the Board Chairman and Key Management Personnel (Provision 4.1)\n\nThe Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the Key Management Personnel to ensure continuity of leadership. Board renewal is a continuing process and in this regard, the NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees, which includes size and mix, and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board's skills set taking into account the Group's strategy and business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.\n\n## Board Development (Provision 4.5)\n\nThe NC reviews the training and development of the Directors to ensure that Directors receive appropriate development on a continuing basis, to perform their roles on the Board and where applicable, the Committees. The Directors are provided with updates and/or briefings to assist them to properly discharge their duties. The briefings are conducted either internally with invited speakers, or externally, at the Company's expense. A separate programme is established for new Directors, details of which together with details of the internal briefing and updates provided to the Directors in 2020 are set out in the paragraph under the subject heading 'Board Orientation and Training' in this report.\n\nThe Board is kept apprised twice yearly on the list of training programmes attended by the Directors during the year.\n\n## Principle 5: Board Performance Board Evaluation Process (Provision 5.1)\n\nThe Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the various Committees and the contribution by each Director towards the effectiveness of the Board and the Committees. No external facilitator has been used. The NC assesses the Board's performance as a whole annually, using objective and appropriate criteria which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board's role on strategy and performance, the Board's process and governance (including oversight on internal controls and risk management), the Board's competencies and effectiveness and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC, including its recommendation, if any, for improvements, are presented to the Board.\n\nThe NC also undertook an evaluation of the performance of the Committees, specifically the ARC, the RC and the BSC with the assistance of self-assessment checklists completed by these Committees.\n\nThe annual evaluation process for the Board Chairman's and the individual Director's performance comprises two parts: (a) review of background information concerning the Director including his attendance records at Board and Committee meetings; and (b) NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters, which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board.\n\nWhen deliberating on the performance of a particular Director who is also a member of the NC, that member abstains from the discussions in order to avoid any conflict of interests.\n\nThe results of the individual evaluation of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman (who is also a member of the NC), to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-election of retiring Directors. The Board Chairman, as a member of the NC, is fully apprised of the results of the performance evaluation for the individual Directors and would take into consideration such evaluation and act as appropriate on the recommendations of the NC. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.\n\n## Board Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nThe qualitative criteria used by the NC to evaluate the Board covers six key areas relating to Board composition, Board independence, Board's review of the Company's strategy and performance, Board's oversight on the Company's governance, including risk management and internal controls, and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman and Board processes.\n\nThe quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprises performance indicators which include a comparison of the Group's performance (including segmental performance) for the financial period under review against the Group's performance for the corresponding period in previous years, and other indicators such as the Company's share price performance over a historical period.\n\n## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nFactors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance include his abilities and competencies, his objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Committee meetings including his knowledge and contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Group. The performance evaluation of each Director is taken into account in the NC's consideration with regard to their re-election as Director.\n\n## REMUNERATION MATTERS\n\n## Principle 6: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies\n\n## RC Composition and Role (Provisions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4)\n\nThe RC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the RC, are independent. The RC's principal responsibilities, as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are to review and recommend, for the endorsement of the Board, a framework of remuneration for Board and Board Committees' fees and the specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and the\n\nCompany's Key Management Personnel ('KMP'). Further, in consultation with the NC and the Management, the RC also considers the talent management framework so as to align with its review of the overall remuneration framework.\n\nThe Company has in place a remuneration framework (which covers all aspects of remuneration) for the Directors and the KMP. The Company has currently identified the Group CEO, the Group GM, the Group CSO, the Group CIO and the Group CFO, who are the most senior members of the Management team as its KMPs. With the privatisation of M&C, the Company has also included M&C's Executive Directors and the position of the M&C Group Chief Executive Officer as its KMPs. On an annual basis, the RC reviews and recommends the specific remuneration packages for the Directors and the KMPs including the annual increments, year-end variable bonuses to be granted to the Executive Chairman and the KMPs for approval by the Board. The RC also considers the contracts of employment of the KMPs to ensure that they do not contain any unfair or unreasonable termination clauses.\n\nIn 2020, Willis Towers Watson, external remuneration consultants, provided benchmarking data on the remuneration for top executives in regional listed real estate companies of comparable size to the Company and in the top listed companies in Singapore across all industries to help the RC in its consideration and proposal of the appropriate level of remuneration for the Company's KMPs to attract, retain and motivate for sustained performance and value creation. The RC deliberated and in view of the COVID-19 pandemic which significantly affected the performance of the Group, it decided not to adjust the KMPs' remuneration packages for FY 2020. The Company has no relationship with the appointed remuneration consultants other than their engagement to provide such benchmarking data, which could affect the said consultants' independence.\n\nThe Company Secretaries maintain records of all RC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. Three meetings of the RC were held in 2020.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the RC conducted a selfassessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('RC Self-Assessment Checklist'). The RC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia, the responsibilities of the RC under its terms of reference and considered also the contribution of RC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at RC meetings.",

In designing the compensation structure, the Company seeks to ensure that the level and mix of remuneration is competitive, relevant and appropriate in finding a balance between the current and longer term objectives of the Company. In its review of the KMPs' remuneration, the RC links the KMPs' key performance indicators against pre-set targets of the 'Growth' and 'Enhancement' strategies with short-term incentive plan, and against pre-set targets of the 'Transformation' strategy with its long-term incentive plan.\n\nBased on the Remuneration Framework, the remuneration packages for the Executive Chairman and KMPs comprise a fixed component (which includes a 13th month Annual Wage Supplement) and a variable component (which currently comprises short-term incentives in the form of variable bonuses) and, where applicable, fixed allowances and benefitsin-kind determined by the Company's Human Resource policies which apply to all employees. When determining the\n\nfixed and variable components for a KMP, the KMP's individual performance is taken into consideration and remuneration recommendations are reviewed in the light of any guidance from the National Wages Council, competitive market practices and information gathered from market surveys conducted by the Company's Human Resource department with input from external remuneration consultants.\n\nThis is further reviewed along with the Group's performance, taking into consideration specific key performance indicators (involving financial and non-financial indicators) tracked over time using the Company's balanced scorecard system that sets out the targets to be achieved by the Company based on its short and long term objectives, which are cascaded down to the various business units. The Company exercises its discretion and independent judgement in ensuring that the amount and mix of compensation are aligned with the interests of shareholders and promote the long-term success of the Company. The overall level of remuneration is not considered to be at a level which is likely to promote behaviour contrary to the Group's risk profile.\n\nThe Company currently does not discourage Directors from holding shares in the Company but note that there is no requirement under the Company's Constitution for Directors to hold shares in order to be qualified to act as a Director.\n\nWhen reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, which comprise base director's fee and additional fees for services rendered on Committees, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and responsibilities in the Board and Committees and the changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compared the Company's fee structure against industry practices. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review include the frequency of Board and Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review. The RC is mindful that the remuneration for IDs should not be excessive so as to compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise their independence. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.\n\nEach of the Directors receives a base Director's fee. The Lead ID also receives an additional fee to reflect her expanded responsibility. Directors who serve on the various Committees (other than the BC) also receive additional fees in respect of each Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Committees (other than the BC) receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairman of the respective Committees.\n\nThe structure of the fees payable to Directors of the Company for FY 2020 is as follows:\n\n| Appointment                   | Per annum   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| Board of Directors - Base fee | $52,500*    |\n| Audit & Risk Committee        |             |\n| - ARC Chairman's fee          | $90,000     |\n| - ARC Member's fee            | $70,000     |\n| Nominating Committee          |             |\n| - NC Chairman's fee           | $22,000     |\n| - NC Member's fee             | $15,000     |\n| Remuneration Committee        |             |\n| - RC Chairman's fee           | $22,000     |\n| - RC Member's fee             | $15,000     |\n\n## Principle 8: Disclosure of Remuneration\n\n## Disclosure of Remuneration (Provisions 8.1(a) and 8.3)\n\nThe compensation packages for employees including the Executive Chairman and the KMPs, based on the Company's Remuneration Framework, also takes into account amongst other factors, the individual's performance, the performance of the Group and industry practices.\n\nDuring the year, there was no termination, retirement or post-employment benefits granted to any Director or KMP.\n\nDirectors' and Group CEO's remuneration for FY 2020, rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars including a breakdown in percentage terms of the components of the remuneration, is set out below:\n\n|                                       | Fixed Salary*   | Variable  Bonuses*   | Board/  Committee  Fees**   | Other   Benefits   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------|\n|                                       | %               | %                    | %                           | %                  | $'000   |\n| Executive Directors                   |                 |                      |                             |                    |         |\n| Kwek Leng Beng^                       | 80              | -

        "page_content": "## C O R P O R A T E G O V E R N A N C E\n\n## Remuneration of Key Management Personnel (KMP) (Provisions 8.1(b) and 8.3)\n\nFor FY 2020, the KMPs (who are not Directors or the Group CEO) have been identified as follows:\n\n- 1. Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, Group General Manager\n- 2. Mr Kwek Eik Sheng, Group Chief Strategy Officer and also Executive Director of M&C\n- 3. Mr Frank Khoo, Group Chief Investment Officer\n- 4. Ms Yiong Yim Ming, Group Chief Financial Officer\n\nThe aggregate remuneration paid to all of the above top KMPs of the Company in FY 2020, including the Group CEO, is $3,596,000 which amount included directors' fees paid or payable by subsidiaries of the Group. This represents a reduction of approximately 62% from the FY 2019 aggregate remuneration (including directors' fees paid or payable by subsidiaries of the Group). The Executive Chairman and the KMPs had requested to forgo their bonus for FY 2020 in view of the Group's overall poor financial performance and the continued challenges faced by the two big acquisitions under the Transformation initiative, namely Sincere Property Group and Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited. The RC accepted their request to forgo their FY 2020 bonus and acknowledged their time and efforts in steering the Group through the extraordinary times.\n\nAs set out above, the Company has taken the further step to identify its KMPs and provided disclosure of the aggregate remuneration paid to these KMPs for FY 2020. The Company however maintains its view that it is not in its interest to disclose the remuneration of each of its KMP, whether in bands of $250,000 or to the nearest thousand dollars. Having considered the highly competitive human resource environment for personnel with the requisite knowledge, expertise and experience in the Company's business activities, such disclosure of specific remuneration information may give rise to recruitment and talent retention issues. There would be negative impact to the Company if members of the experienced and qualified senior management team are poached, which may affect the ability to both nurture a sustainable talent pool and ensure the smooth continuity in leadership critical for the achievement of the strategic objectives of the Company. The Company believes that shareholders' interest will not be prejudiced as a result of such non-disclosure of the remuneration for each of the Company's KMP, and with the Company's disclosure on the aggregate remuneration of the identified KMPs, shareholders are provided an insight into the level of remuneration paid to the identified KMPs.\n\n## Remuneration of Directors' Immediate Family Members for FY 2020 (Provision 8.2)\n\nThere are no other employees of the Company who are substantial shareholders of the Company or immediate family members of a Director or the Group CEO, and whose remuneration exceeds $100,000 during the year.\n\n## Share Option Schemes (Provision 8.3)\n\nWhilst the Company currently does not have a share option or long-term incentive scheme in place, it will consider the establishment of other forms of longer term incentive as and when appropriate. When such long-term incentive scheme is established in due course with the assistance of external advisers, the Company will consider the inclusion of clawback provisions within the scheme which would give the right to the Company to reclaim incentive components from participants in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company.\n\n## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT\n\n## Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls\n\nThe Company maintains an adequate and effective system of internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology (IT) controls) and risk management systems to safeguard stakeholders' interests and the Company's assets. The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk, including determining the risk strategy, risk appetite and risk limits, as well as the risk policies.\n\nThe boards and their board committees, comprising a majority of independent directors, of the Group's separately listed subsidiaries are responsible for the oversight of their respective groups' corporate governance, and to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of their respective groups' internal controls and risk management systems. The Directors of the Company therefore rely on these boards and board committees to ensure that steps are taken for adoption and implementation of appropriate corporate governance practices, internal controls and risk management systems within their respective groups. Further information on the corporate governance practices, internal controls and risk management systems of the Group's listed subsidiaries can be found in the corporate governance statements of these public listed subsidiaries as published in their respective annual reports.\n\n## Oversight of Risk Management (Provision 9.1)\n\nThe ARC assists the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibility of overseeing the Company's risk management framework and policies and ensuring that Management maintains a sound system of internal controls and risk management.\n\nThe Company's Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') Framework is undertaken by the Risk Management Committee ('RMC'), chaired by Group CEO and comprising the Senior Management team, key functional leaders and heads of business divisions.\n\nThe ARC receives regular reports on the risk management activities of the Company and progress on the ERM framework. Key risks including Tier 1 risks are reviewed and refreshed to ensure relevant emerging risks are being considered and included for proper assessment, monitoring and reporting as appropriate. Based on the reports of the RMC, the ARC is satisfied that significant risks identified are assessed, managed and monitored adequately within the Company's ERM Framework. The ERM Framework includes a periodic review of the risk appetite statements and risk appetite and tolerance limits for these key risks, which statements and limits are considered and endorsed by the ARC and the Board.\n\nHaving regard to the risks to which the Company is exposed, the likelihood of such risks occurring and the risk tolerance accepted by the Company, an internal controls structure has been designed and put in place by the Management to provide reasonable assurance against material financial misstatements, for the safeguarding of assets, for the maintenance of proper accounting records, on the reliability, relevance and integrity of the information (including financial information).\n\nThe Company's approach to risk management is set out in the 'Risk Management' section on pages 59 to 64 of this AR.\n\nAs part of the internal and external audit programmes, the internal and external auditors report to the ARC any audit findings relating to internal controls, and the ARC reviews the adequacy of the actions taken by Management to address the recommendations of the internal and external auditors.\n\nThe ARC also receives regular reports, briefings and updates from the RMC, the Chief Technology Officer, the internal and external auditors and the Management team during its meetings to help the ARC to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's material internal controls that address the Group's financial, operational, compliance and IT controls.\n\n## Assurances from the Key Management Personnel (Provision 9.2)\n\nIn relation to Provision 9.2 of the CG Code and SGX Listing Rule 1207(10), the ARC received:\n\n- (i) written assurance from the Group CEO and the Group CFO that the Group's financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances; and\n- (ii)  written assurance from the Group CEO and the KMPs that the Group's risk management and internal controls systems in place were adequate and effective to address the principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations for FY 2020.\n\nThe above written assurances on the Group's internal controls and risk management systems are provided half yearly and are supported by similar written assurances provided by the heads of the Group's key operating divisions/functions and key operating subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's separately listed subsidiaries have respective boards who are responsible for the oversight of their respective groups' internal controls and risk management systems. Written assurance is received from the senior management team of these listed subsidiaries, on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management systems of their respective groups.\n\nThe integration process with M&C to ensure that key aspects of M&C's governance regime, internal controls and risk management systems to substantially align with those of the Company is still in progress.\n\nThe process of reviewing and strengthening the Group's control environment is an evolving process. When controls should be enhanced, the Board and Management take action to rectify and strengthen the internal controls and risk management systems. The Board and Management will continue to devote resources and expertise towards improving its internal policies and procedures to maintain a high level of governance and internal controls. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against poor judgement in decisionmaking, human errors, losses, fraud and other irregularities.\n\nBased on the work performed by Internal Auditors, the external auditors and the periodic reports from the RMC and Management, as well as the written assurances from the Executive Committee to support the opinion to be given",

During the year, Mr Koh Thiam Hock and Ms Tan Yee Peng stepped down from the ARC following their respective resignations from the Board of the Company. The chairman of the ARC, Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny, together with a newly appointed ARC member, Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, being the majority of the ARC, possess the relevant audit, accounting or related financial management and risk management expertise and experience, whilst the remaining newly appointed member of the ARC, Mr Chong Yoon Chou, has financial and risk management background.\n\nWith the current composition, the ARC is of the opinion that it has the relevant accounting and related financial management expertise and experience to discharge its functions within its written terms of reference which has been approved by the Board.\n\nBased on the terms of reference of the ARC, a former partner or director of the Company's existing auditing firm or auditing corporation should not act as a member of the ARC: (a) within a period of two years commencing on the date of his or her ceasing to be a partner of the auditing firm or director of the auditing corporation; and in any case, (b) for as long as he or she has any financial interest in the auditing firm or auditing corporation. Although two of the ARC members, namely Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny and Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, were previously partners of the Company's existing auditors, KPMG LLP, they have ceased to be partners more than 20 years and 2 years ago respectively, and confirmed that they do not have any financial interest in KPMG LLP. The remaining ARC member does not have any relationship with the Company's existing auditors.\n\n## Powers and Duties of the ARC (Provision 10.1)\n\nThe ARC is authorised by the Board to review or investigate any matters it deems appropriate within its terms of reference and has direct and unrestricted access to the external and internal auditors. It may invite any Director, Management, officer or employee of the Company to attend its meetings. It is also authorised to engage any firm of accountants, lawyers or other professionals as it sees fit to provide independent counsel and advice to assist in the review or investigation\n\non such matters within its terms of reference as it deems appropriate at the Company's expense.\n\nThe principal responsibility of the ARC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's financial reporting process (including reviewing the accounting policies and practices of the Company and the Group on a consolidated basis) and key internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance, IT and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include:\n\n- \u00b7 to review with Management and, where appropriate, with the external auditors the significant financial reporting issues and judgements so as to ensure the integrity of the half yearly and full year financial statements of the Group to be issued by the Company before their submission to the Board and any other announcements relating to the Group's financial performance;\n- \u00b7 to review annually the scope and results of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and in this regard to also review the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group;\n- \u00b7 to make recommendations to the Board on the nomination for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of external auditors, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;\n- \u00b7 to assess the role and effectiveness of the internal audit ('IA') function in the overall context of the Group's internal controls and risk management systems, and to consider the results of their review and evaluation of the Group's internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management policies and systems;\n- \u00b7 to approve the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the Head of IA;\n- \u00b7 to review interested person transactions falling within the scope of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual; and\n- \u00b7 to oversee the establishment and operation of the Company's whistle-blowing policy and arrangements put in place for raising concerns about possible improprieties on matters of financial reporting or any other matters.\n\nIn the review of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, the ARC has discussed with both the Management and the external auditors the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the business segments in which the Group operates, and the accounting principles that were applied and their judgement of items that might affect the integrity of the financial statements. The following significant matters impacting the financial statements were discussed with Management and the external auditors:\n\n## Significant Matters How the ARC reviewed these matters and what decisions were made\n\nAccounting for the Group's investment in HCP Chongqing Property Development Co Ltd and its subsidiaries ('HCP Group')\n\n## Accounting for the Group's acquisition of HCP Group\n\nThe Group acquired a 63.75% equity interest in HCP, an investment holding company for approximately $0.9 billion. This gives the Group an indirect 51.01% ownership in Chongqing Sincere Yuanchuang Industrial Co., Ltd. ('Sincere Property'). The Group had accounted for the investment in HCP as a business combination and an investment in a joint venture. Where an acquisition is accounted for as a business combination, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent liabilities (purchase price allocation or 'PPA').  Significant judgement is involved in estimating the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nThe ARC reviewed the approach and methodology applied in the PPA exercise and the key assumptions adopted in arriving at the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities. The ARC took into account Management's reliance on the valuation reports of the independent valuers to determine the fair values of the underlying properties held by HCP Group as well as Management's assessment based on available information, of the significant estimates including the recoverability of receivables and contingent liabilities.\n\nThe ARC also considered the findings of the external auditors on the PPA assessment performed by Management, including their assessment of the appropriateness of valuation methodologies and underlying key estimates and  assumptions applied in estimating the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of HCP Group.\n\nThe ARC was satisfied with the accounting treatment of the acquisition of HCP Group as a joint venture, and the PPA approach, including the valuation methodology and estimates used for the PPA assessment, were considered appropriate and reasonable.\n\n## Accounting for the Group's impairment of equity investment in HCP Group\n\nThe ARC noted that the PPA exercise gave rise to a resultant goodwill of $0.9 billion and the Group impaired the investment in HCP Group fully as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe ARC reviewed Management's assessment of the recoverable amount and any consequential loss on the equity investment in HCP.  The review included the review of the financial position of HCP Group, which took into consideration the fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities of HCP Group, the challenging macro-economic environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit tightening measures imposed on China's real estate sector and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property.\n\nThe ARC also discussed Management's assessment of the impairment in HCP Group with the external auditors.\n\nThe ARC was satisfied with the impairment assessment undertaken by Management in impairing the equity investment in HCP Group fully.",

The Group had considered the probability that the corporate guarantee would be enforced and recognised a provision for the full amount of the guarantee.\n\nThe ARC reviewed Management's assessment of the probability of the guarantee being enforced, taking into consideration the financial position of HCP Group, the non-repayment of certain loans and bonds upon maturity post 31 December 2020 by Sincere Property, and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property.\n\nThe ARC was satisfied with the assessment adopted by Management in recognising a provision for the full amount of the guarantee.\n\nThe accounting for the Group's investment in HCP Group was also an area of focus for the external auditors. The external auditors have included these matters as a key audit matter in their audit report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. Refer to pages 108 to 111 of the AR.\n\nThe ARC reviewed the selection criteria used by the Management in identifying hotel assets for impairment assessment.\n\nThe ARC reviewed the Management's approach and methodology applied in assessing the valuation of the hotel assets conducted by external valuers, except for M Social Hotel which was valued by an internal valuer. The review included the review of the key assumptions applied in the valuation of hotel assets such as forecasted cashflows, occupancy rates, average room rate growth, discount rates and terminal rates in the valuation model.\n\nThe ARC noted that the valuation reports obtained from the external valuers for certain hotels also highlighted that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty, and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to their valuations than would normally be the case. Although there are signs of improvement and the availability of the COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic continues to significantly impact the hospitality sector. Continued uncertainty of the tourism industry and the on-going travel restrictions are expected to prolong the recovery of the accommodation sector. The external valuers have therefore also recommended to keep the valuation of these properties under frequent review.\n\n## Significant Matters How the ARC reviewed these matters and what decisions were made\n\n| Valuation of development   | The ARC was satisfied with the valuation process and the valuers are members of recognised professional  bodies for valuers and have considered their own independence in carrying out their work. The valuation  methodologies used are in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions  used are comparable to the range of market data, taking into consideration the uncertainty arising  from the COVID-19 pandemic.  The valuation of the hotel assets was also an area of focus for the external auditors. The external                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| properties                 | The ARC noted the COVID-19 pandemic has increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook,  government policies and market sentiments, which might exert downward pressure on property prices  in countries where the Group holds development properties for sale. These factors could lead to future  trends in these markets departing from known trends from past experience, thereby resulting in a  significant impact on the future selling price estimates.  Consequently, there is a risk that the carrying  values of unsold development properties could exceed the actual selling prices, resulting in unforeseen  losses when these properties are sold. |\n|                            | The ARC considered the approach and methodology applied in assessing the net realisable values of  development properties, especially for development properties with low profit margins. Where appropriate,  the ARC inquired of Management the basis of valuation and the strategy to sell the unsold units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                            | future selling prices by comparing these to recent transacted prices or prices of comparable properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                            | located in the vicinity of the Group's development projects.

The Head of IA's primary reporting line is to the ARC. The appointment, resignation and dismissal of the Head of IA is reviewed and approved by the ARC. The ARC also provides input on the annual performance appraisal of the Head of IA and reviews his compensation within the compensation policies of the Company. The ARC meets the Head of IA at least once annually without the presence of Management. The Head of IA has unfettered access to the ARC, the Board and Management as well as the Group's documents, records, properties and personnel relevant for the performance of audits.\n\nIA operates within the framework stated in its IA Charter which is approved and reviewed by the ARC on an annual basis. The standards of the IA Charter are consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), an international professional association with global headquarters in United States of America. The Head of IA is a Certified Internal Auditor and the IA function is a corporate member of the Institute of Internal Auditors Singapore (IIAS), an affiliate of the IIA. Processes are in place to ensure that the professional competence of the IA staff is maintained and upgraded through continuing professional education programmes which comprises technical and non-technical training for the development of the IA staff.",

        "page_content": "## C O R P O R A T E G O V E R N A N C E\n\n## Role and Activities of IA\n\nThe primary role of IA is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management processes of the Company, reviewing the internal controls of the Company to ensure prompt and accurate recording of transactions and proper safeguarding of assets and reviewing the Company's compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies of the Company.\n\nThe ARC approved the annual IA plan and received regular reports during 2020 on the progress of the audit work under the IA plan. All IA reports are given to a designated member of the ARC, the KMPs and the Heads of the relevant business divisions, with a summary report provided to the ARC at the ARC meetings. IA observations on internal control, operational and human lapses and recommendations to address them were also reviewed and discussed at ARC meetings. The ARC was satisfied that recommendations made were dealt with by the Management in a timely and appropriate manner, with outstanding exceptions or recommendations being closely monitored and reported back to the ARC.\n\nThe ARC reviewed the effectiveness and adequacy of the IA function through a review of the IA activities on a regular basis as well as its annual assessment of the IA function. The assessment was adapted from the framework recommended in the Guidebook for Audit Committees in Singapore Singapore Edition, issued in 2014. The evaluation framework is comprehensive and covers IA organisation, resources and continuing training, audit plans work scope, quality of reports and recommendations, IA Charter and IA internal control assessment. Based on the assessment, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the IA function and that the IA function is currently adequately resourced and has appropriate independent standing within the Group to perform its functions effectively.\n\n## Provision 10.5\n\nThe ARC held ten meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all ARC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. The ARC meets with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of Management, annually.\n\nThe ARC members keep themselves abreast of changes to accounting standards and tax and other issues which may have a material impact on financial statements. These included the following trainings attended in 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 ACRA-SGX-SID Audit Committee Seminar 2020: Looking Beyond the Veneer of Numbers\n\n- \u00b7 KPMG Singapore Budget 2020 Business Leaders Forum\n- \u00b7 AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: Managing Risks in a Digital World - The New Corporate Headache\n- \u00b7 AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: The Approaching Storm Know your Sea Worthiness\n- \u00b7 AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: Into the Storm - Minimise and Repair the Damage\n- \u00b7 AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: Leveraging Analytics & Technology for Internal Control and Fraud Prevention\n- \u00b7 AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: Reviewing Financial Statements and Selecting Auditors\n- \u00b7 SID Audit Committee Chairmen's Conversation\n- \u00b7 SID Virtual Conference 2020\n- \u00b7 Cyber Security & Data Protection First Aid Kit\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 Embedding Resilence Webinar: Navigating Liquidity\n- \u00b7 COVID-19  Embedding  Resilence  Webinar:  Risk Management (With a Focus on Fraud and Cyber Risks)\n\nFor the financial year under review, the ARC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('ARC Self-Assessment Checklist').\n\nThe ARC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia, the responsibilities of the ARC under its terms of reference, and also considered the contribution of ARC members to the ARC's deliberation and decision-making process.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the ARC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITORS\n\nTaking cognisance that the external auditors should be free from any business or other relationships with the Group that could materially interfere with their ability to act with integrity and objectivity, the ARC undertook a review of the independence of KPMG LLP ('KPMG') and gave careful consideration to the Group's relationships with them during 2020. In determining the independence of KPMG, the ARC reviewed all aspects of the Group's relationships with them including the policies, processes and safeguards adopted by the Group and KPMG to protect and preserve audit independence. The ARC also considered the nature and volume of the provision of the non-audit services in 2020 and the corresponding fees to ensure that such non-audit fees did not impair or threaten the audit independence. It was noted\n\nthat the fees for non-audit services did not exceeded 50% of the aggregate amount of all fees paid/payable to KPMG in 2020. Based on the review, the ARC is of the opinion that KPMG is, and is perceived to be, independent for the purpose of the Group's statutory financial audit.\n\nDetails of the fees paid and/or payable by the Group in respect of audit and non-audit services for FY 2020 are set out below:\n\n|                           | $'million   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Audit fees paid to:       |             |\n| - auditors of the Company | 3.2         |\n| - other auditors          | 6.1         |\n| Non-audit fees paid to:   |             |\n| - auditors of the Company | 1.6         |\n| - other auditors          | 1.8         |\n\nIn reviewing the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment for the financial year ending 31 December 2021, the ARC had considered the adequacy of the resources and experience of KPMG and the audit engagement partners assigned to the audit, the size and complexity of the audit exercise for the Group, and the number and experience of the supervisory and professional staff assigned to the Group's audit through a review of the curriculum vita of the KPMG audit team. The ARC had also considered the quality of discussions with the findings raised by KPMG, including the Audit Quality Indicators presented. Ms Lo Mun Wai was appointed the Group's engagement partner-in-charge from the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nKPMG has confirmed that they are registered with ACRA. The Company is thus in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 (read with Rule 716) of the Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its auditors.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the ARC has recommended to the Board the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment as external auditors at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Whistle-blowing Policy (Provision 10.1(F))\n\nCDL has in place a whistle-blowing policy and procedure where employees of the Company can raise in confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, concerns on possible improprieties relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters or other matters without fear of reprisals in any form. The ARC has the responsibility of overseeing this policy which is properly administered with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining procedures for the confidential submission of reports and the identity of the whistle-blower concerned will not be disclosed if so requested by the whistle-blower who lodged the report. Investigations of such reports will be handled on a confidential basis to the extent permissible or deemed appropriate under the circumstances and involve persons who need to be involved in order to properly carry out the investigation and will, on a best efforts basis, be carried out in a timely manner.\n\nIn order to facilitate and encourage the reporting of such matters, the whistle-blowing policy, together with the dedicated whistle-blowing communication channels (email and postal address as well as toll-free telephone contact numbers in various countries) are available on the Company's website and intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe whistle-blowing policy and procedures are reviewed by the ARC from time to time to ensure that they remain current.\n\nFor more information on the said policy and procedures, please refer to the Company's website at www.cdl.com.sg.\n\n## INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Company had obtained shareholders' approval at its Annual General Meeting held on 24 June 2020 ('2020  AGM') for the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies not listed on SGX-ST or an approved exchange, over which the Company, its subsidiaries and/or interested persons have control, to enter into transactions within the categories of Interested Person Transactions set out in the Company's Letter to Shareholders dated 26 March 2020, with such persons within the class or classes of Interested Persons as described in the said circular, provided that such transactions are entered into in accordance with the review procedures set out in the said circular (the 'IPT Mandate'). The IPT Mandate is subject to annual renewal by the shareholders. Given that such Interested Person Transactions are expected to occur with some degree of frequency and may arise at any time, and to allow the Group to undertake such transactions in an expeditious manner, shareholders' approval will be sought at the 2021 AGM of the Company for the renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\nThe ARC has confirmed that an independent financial adviser's opinion is not required for the renewal of the IPT Mandate as the methods or procedures for determining the transaction prices of the IPTs conducted under the IPT Mandate have remained appropriate since shareholders approved the renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2020 AGM, and the methods or procedures continue to be sufficient to ensure that these IPTs will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders.",

The shareholders' loans referred herein have been extended by all the joint venture parties or shareholders in proportion to their respective equity interest in the joint venture and on the same terms and conditions, including the interest rate, if any, accrued or to be accrued on the shareholders' loans.\n\nThe above interested person transactions were carried out on normal commercial terms and were not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders.\n\n## SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT\n\n## Principle 11: Shareholder Rights and Conduct of General Meetings\n\nBeing committed to good corporate practices, the Company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably. To facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights, the Company ensures that all material information relating to the Company and its financial performance is disclosed in an accurate and timely manner via SGXNET and uploaded at the Company's corporate website.\n\n## General Meetings (Provisions 11.1, 11.2, 11.3)\n\nAll shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy. The rules for the appointment of proxies, including information that voting will be conducted by way of poll, are set out in the notice of general meetings. In accordance with the Constitution of the Company, shareholders who are not relevant intermediaries may appoint not more\n\nthan two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings in their absence, and shareholders who are relevant intermediaries may appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. The proxy forms must be deposited at such place or places specified in the notice or document accompanying the notice convening the general meetings at least seventy-two hours before the time set for the general meetings.\n\nThe Company provides for separate resolutions at general meetings on each substantial issue, including treating the reelection of each Director as a separate subject matter. Detailed information on each item in the AGM agenda is provided in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM in the AR.\n\nAt general meetings of the Company, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and are encouraged to ask the Directors and the Management questions regarding matters affecting the Company.\n\n## 2020 AGM and 2021 AGM\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 situation, the 2020 AGM was convened and held by electronic means on 24 June 2020 pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020 (the 'Order').\n\nAlternative Arrangements relating to attendance at the AGM via electronic means (including arrangements by which the meeting can be electronically accessed via 'live' audio-visual webcast or 'live' audio only stream), submission of questions to the Chairman of the Meeting in advance of the 2020 AGM, addressing of substantial and relevant questions prior to the AGM and voting by appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy at the AGM, were put in place for the 2020 AGM. The mode of the convening and conduct of the 2021 AGM are dependent on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore nearer the date of the 2021 AGM. Shareholders would be notified by the Company in advance of the 2021 AGM.\n\nThe Board Chairman and the chairmen of the ARC, NC, RC and BSC and the external auditors were present virtually at the 2020 AGM.\n\n## Voting at General Meetings (Provision 11.4)\n\nShareholders are given the opportunity to vote at general meetings either in person or in absentia by way of appointed proxy (proxies). However, as the authentication of shareholder identity information and other related integrity issues still remain a concern, the Company has decided, for the time being, not to implement voting in absentia by electronic means.\n\nPursuant to Rule 730A(2) of the Listing Manual, all resolutions to be proposed at the 2021 AGM and at any adjournment thereof shall be put to the vote by way of poll.\n\nIn support of greater transparency and to allow for a more efficient voting system, the Company has been conducting electronic poll voting instead of voting by show of hands since the 2012 AGM and will continue to do so in respect of all resolutions proposed at the 2020 AGM. With electronic poll voting, shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting will be entitled to vote on a 'one-share, one-vote basis. The voting results of all votes cast in respect of each resolution will also be instantaneously displayed on screen at the meeting. The detailed results setting out the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages will be announced via SGXNET after the 2021 AGM. An external firm is appointed as scrutineers for the AGM voting process, which is independent of the firm appointed to undertake the electronic poll voting process.\n\n## Minutes of General Meetings (Provision 11.5)\n\nThe Company also maintains minutes of its general meetings, which include the key comments and queries raised by shareholders and the responses from the Board, Management and/or the external auditors. The minutes of the general meetings are available on the Company's corporate website, and the Company will also furnish the general meeting minutes to any shareholder upon request.\n\n## Dividend Policy (Provision 11.6)\n\nThe Company has formalised its dividend policy which aims to provide a return to shareholders at least once a year through the payment of dividends, after taking into account the Group's financial performance, short and long term capital requirements, future investment plans, general global and business economic conditions and any regulatory factors. The Board endeavours to maintain a balance between meeting shareholders' expectations and prudent capital management with a sustainable dividend policy. The Board will review the dividend policy from time to time and reserves the right to modify, amend and update the policy.\n\n## Principle 12: Engagement with Shareholders\n\nThe Company notifies its investors in advance of the date of release of its financial results via SGXNET. For FY 2020, results for the half year were released via SGXNET within 45 days of the end of 30 June 2020 whilst the full year results were released within 60 days from the financial year end. In presenting the Group's financial results, the Board aims to provide investors with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and financial position with a commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industry in which it operates.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the Group CEO and the Group CFO provided assurance to the ARC and the Board on the integrity of the half year unaudited financial statements and the Board in turn provided a negative assurance confirmation in respect of the unaudited financial statements for the half year in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Company ensures that investors are notified of all material information in an accurate and timely manner. Should there be an inadvertent disclosure made to a select group, the Company will release the same information as promptly as possible via SGXNET. The financial statements and other presentation materials presented at the Company's general meetings, including material and price-sensitive information, are disseminated and publicly released via SGXNET on a timely basis.",

In addition, the Company leverages on other communication platforms such as its e-publication, City News (www.cdl.com.sg/citynews) and social media channels (LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram) to provide latest updates on the Group's business and performance milestones. Investors can subscribe to email alerts on the CDL website or follow its social media channels to receive updates on its latest news.\n\nFrom time to time, the Board Chairman and the Company's Management hold briefings with analysts and the media to coincide with the release of the Group's half-year and fullyear financial results. Media presentation slides are also released on SGXNET and on the Company's website. A live video webcast was arranged for investors at the analysts/ media briefing for the full year 2020 results in February 2021. In addition, the Management takes an active role in investor relations, meeting local and foreign fund managers regularly as well as participating in investor roadshows and conferences both locally and overseas. The Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, is responsible for managing the Group's investor relations programmes, including the communications with the financial community, research analysts and relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Investor Relations Policy (Provisions 12.2 and 12.3)\n\nThe Company is committed to building investor confidence and trust through effective open, two-way communication with shareholders and the investment community. The Company's Investor Relations (IR) Policy, available on the CDL corporate website (www.cdl.com.sg), sets out the process and mechanism to engage its stakeholders, including the channel of communication through which shareholders and investors may pose queries and through which the Company may respond. The IR Policy outlines the principles and framework in which the Company communicates and engages with investors, analysts and other IR stakeholders to provide balanced, clear and pertinent information. To provide investors with a better understanding of the Group's business and growth drivers, regular updates on the Group's strategies, operations and financial performance are available across multiple platforms.\n\nFurther information on the Company's investor relations policy and activities can be found on pages 65 and 66 of the AR.\n\n## Principle 13: Engagement with Stakeholders\n\nThe Company undertakes a comprehensive materiality assessment every two years, which is facilitated by a third party, to determine the key economic, environmental, social and governance issues ('EESG') that are important to the Company's stakeholders. A validation of the key EESG issues is performed between each study. These issues form the materiality matrix upon which targets, metrics, initiatives and progress are reviewed by the Management team, reported to the BSC and the Board for approval, before they are published annually in the Company's Integrated Sustainability Report ('ISR').\n\nWhile the last comprehensive study was conducted in 2019, CDL recognised the need to conduct a special assessment in 2020 with more extensive scope and depth to identify the shifting priorities and expectations of its stakeholders in the 'new normal' caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe process started with an extensive macro scanning exercise to determine the list of material risks and opportunities relevant to CDL's business for sustained growth. Engagement with internal and external stakeholders were then conducted through online surveys, followed by interviews with selected senior-level stakeholders to extract deeper insights, such as their perspectives on how COVID-19 has impacted them, the relevance of sustainability to business resilience, and how CDL can continue to remain competitive and sustainable in the post-COVID environment.\n\nWith the fast-changing business landscape and externalities, the latest materiality assessment will help to sharpen CDL's sustainability strategy and focus resources on areas that are deemed most material to its business. The findings are important to support the scope of the Company's ISR.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, CDL publishes an online Sustainability Report on its microsite at www.cdlsustainability.com. This voluntary initiative that started in July 2017 updates stakeholders of CDL's  progress towards key goals and targets set under its Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint, and sets benchmarks for the transparency and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\nThe BSC assists the Board in the review and consideration of the Company's sustainability issues and approach to sustainability reporting. The BSC comprises four Directors, with the Group CEO in the chair and three other independent Directors. The BSC's terms of reference sets out, inter alia, the objectives, roles and responsibilities of the BSC. It also includes the BSC's purview over matters relating to the Company's ESG strategy, ESG targets, the sustainability reporting framework and also the Company's policies, practices and performance on its material ESG factors which are significant and contribute to the Company's performance, business activities, and/or reputation as a global corporate citizen.\n\nThe annual ISR provides a comprehensive account of CDL's ESG strategy, and performance. It is dedicated to reporting on CDL's sustainability efforts that address the social and environmental impacts pertinent to the Company's business and operations. CDL's ISRs are prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, Comprehensive option since ISR 2017. Previous ISRs were aligned with GRI's G4 Guidelines. To address the more demanding and diverse expectation of stakeholders, CDL has embraced the International Integrated Reporting Council's ('IIRC') Integrated Reporting approach since 2015, SDG Reporting since 2016, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') framework since 2018, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards for Real Estate Sector since 2020. For ISR 2021, CDL has added the Climate Disclosures Standards Board ('CDSB') framework to CDL's unique blended reporting framework. This aims to report the Company's climate strategy and efforts to strengthen its natural capital. The Company will be issuing its ISR 2021 concurrently with AR 2020. These ISRs are available on both CDL's corporate website and the dedicated sustainability microsite.\n\nFurther information on the Company's approach to stakeholder engagement and its materiality assessment can be found on pages 67 to 79 of the AR.\n\n## CORPORATE VALUES AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS\n\nThe Board and Management are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has in place an internal code of business and ethical conduct crystallising the Company's business principles and practices with respect to matters which may have ethical implications.\n\nThe code, which provides a communicable and understandable framework for employees to observe the Company's principles such as honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in their relationships with customers, suppliers and amongst employees, is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe code provides guidance on issues such as:\n\n- \u00b7 conflicts of interest and the appropriate disclosures to be made;\n- \u00b7 the Company's stance against corruption and bribery;\n- \u00b7 compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment and the conservation of energy and natural resources;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the Company's policies and procedures, including those on internal controls and accounting;\n- \u00b7 safeguarding and proper use of the Company's assets, confidential information and intellectual property rights, including the respect of the intellectual property rights of third parties; and\n- \u00b7 competition and fair dealing in the conduct of the Company's business, in its relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and towards its employees.\n\nIn line with the Board's commitment to maintain high ethical standards which are integral to its corporate identity and business, the Company has the following three key corporate policies in place:\n\n- (i) Anti-Corruption Policy & Guidelines which sets out the responsibilities of the Group companies and of each employee in observing and upholding CDL's 'zerotolerance' position against all forms of corruption, bribery and extortion and provides information and guidance to employees on how to recognise, address, resolve, avoid and prevent instances of corruption, bribery and extortion which may arise in the course of their work.",

These policies have been translated into Mandarin and Thai for dissemination to employees of the Group in the People's Republic of China and in Thailand.\n\nThe Company's policy on how it manages and protects personal data in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements are set out in the CDL Personal Data Policy.\n\nThe Company has also set out the following sustainability policies which are available on the Company's corporate website:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy - Established in 2003, the EHS Policy sets the strategic direction for all departments and employees towards creating a 'Safe & Green' corporate culture by adhering to regulatory compliance, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring a safe, fair and inclusive workplace.\n- \u00b7 Human Rights Policy - Sets out the Company's commitment in upholding fundamental principles of human and workplace rights in places where the Company operates. Beyond compliance to the local government's policies and regulations in protecting human rights, CDL is committed to respecting human rights in all aspects of its stakeholder engagement such as equitable employment practices, non-discrimination, welfare and fair compensation, as well as workplace health and safety within its developments.\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Policy - In line with CDL's corporate social responsibility strategy and commitment to 'Conserving as We Construct' since 1995, the Company is dedicated to achieving low carbon operations. Since 2018, CDL has set a Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi')-validated carbon emissions reduction target of 59% by 2030, against baseline of 2007, to limit global temperature rise below 2\u00b0C. Raising the bar on the Company's decarbonisation efforts, CDL\n\nbecame the first real estate developer in Singapore and the first real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to sign on to the WorldGBC's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in February 2021, committing to achieving net zero operational carbon by 2030 for its new and existing wholly-owned assets and developments under its direct operational and management control. Recognising that a sizeable proportion of the Company's carbon footprint extends beyond its business operations and direct control, the Company actively engages its supply chain and stakeholders to mitigate climate impact and to add value to the communities in which it operates.\n\n- \u00b7 Green Building Policy - CDL is committed to incorporating decarbonisation, innovation, inclusivity, and health and well-being into the design and operation of its buildings. To provide a safe, healthy and inclusive environment for its employees, customers, and workers, it is crucial to proactively adopt smart and sustainable building technologies. The 3S Framework built on the three thrusts - Smart, Sustainable, Super Low Energy - will drive CDL's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint and environmental impact to help achieve the Paris Agreement global climate targets.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity Policy - CDL supports Singapore's 'City in Nature ' vision towards higher living standards while co-existing with flora and fauna. The Company aims to minimise and mitigate the impacts of its developments on natural habitats and to protect wildlife biodiversity.\n\n## INTERNAL CODE ON DEALINGS IN SECURITIES\n\nThe Company has in place an internal code on securities trading which sets out the implications of insider trading and provides guidance and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the Company's securities by its Directors and employees. These guidelines prohibit dealing in the Company's securities (a) on short-term considerations, (b) while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive information in relation to such securities, and (c) during the 'closed period', which will be one month before the date of announcement of the Company's half year and full-year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. The Directors and employees of the Company are notified in advance of the commencement of each 'closed period' relating to dealing in the Company's securities. The internal code on securities trading is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\n## R I S K MANAGEMENT\n\n## MANAGING RISKS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES AND MAXIMISE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nManaging risk is an integral part of the Group's business and we continually strive towards having the best risk management practices appropriate for our business. The Group's risk management framework provides the principles and guidance for the Group's risk management activities.\n\n## CDL's ERM Framework\n\n## Four (4) key pillars that serve as the foundation of ERM execution and implementation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the year, the Group's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function implemented several initiatives targeted at strengthening the aspects of people and process which are key elements to our risk management framework. Some of the notable initiatives include:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhanced and continued to conduct compliance training sessions covering anti-money laundering / counterterrorism financing, cyber threat and data privacy, to raise the level of awareness and understanding, as well as improve the capabilities of our first line of defence against such risks.\n- \u00b7 Completion of a Group-wide fraud risk assessment and review exercise, which involves reviewing the robustness of our internal controls in mitigating the Group's exposure to fraud risks, and enhancing the Group's Fraud Policy and Guidelines.\n- \u00b7 Enhancement of the data handling and protection policies, and tightening the controls and security measures, in line with the amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act.\n- \u00b7 Updated the control self-assessment programme, with the assessment focusing on risk drivers of identified key risks, to facilitate early identification of control gaps and areas for improvement.\n- \u00b7 Proactive monitoring and response to developments related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including adapting our business continuity plans and measures appropriately to minimise any operational disruptions as well as safety of our stakeholders.\n\nThe Group's ERM Framework and initiatives are also rolled out to subsidiary companies and affiliates to ensure that risk management practices are aligned, and all material risk factors are duly considered and adequately addressed. The Group's ERM function facilitates the alignment process and provides guidance through training and knowledge-sharing sessions to raise employees' risk awareness and embrace the Group's risk culture.\n\n## RISK STRATEGY\n\nOur risk strategy is based on the belief that risk management is the responsibility of all employees and that it must be integrated into strategy formulation, capital allocation, decision making, and day-to-day operations. The fostering of strong and sustainable 'self-driven' risk culture is guided by defined principles that underpin the ERM operating model.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\n- \u00b7 Line managers are to own risks and be accountable.\n- \u00b7 Risk management activities are to hinge not only on processes and systems, but equally on a right mindset and attitude.\n- \u00b7 Risk management is to be benchmarked against global best practices.\n\n## RISK CULTURE\n\nWith the belief that effective risk management requires a strong 'risk aware' culture to reinforce 'doing the right thing' naturally, our Management is fully committed to fostering a strong risk-centric culture through setting the appropriate tone at the top and demonstrating strong support for risk management. Risk awareness and accountability are embedded in our culture through our governance structure that ensures appropriate oversight and accountability for effective management of risks throughout the Group, further supported by risk management principles that are embedded in all our decision-making and business processes.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nThe risk appetite set defines the extent of risks the Group is able and willing to take on to achieve our strategic and business objectives. The purpose of establishing a risk appetite framework is not to limit risk-taking, but to ensure that the Group's risk profile remains within tolerable boundaries as opportunities are maximised. The risk appetite statements, along with the accompanying risk tolerance limits in both quantitative and/or qualitative terms, are reviewed annually.\n\nThe Board has approved the following risk appetite statements:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group will continue to focus on business activities in identified core markets. Apart from the core markets, the Group will otherwise not be overly exposed to any other single country.",

From acquisition to divestment, all investments undertaken should not have potential loss exposure that could significantly threaten the Group's going concern assumption.\n- \u00b7 The Group will avoid any situations and/or actions that may result in negative impact on our reputation and branding. Should such situations arise, they will be managed aggressively to preserve our reputation and brand image.\n- \u00b7 The Group will maintain adequate liquid assets to cover planned cash outflows and will not take speculative positions on interest rates and foreign exchange.\n- \u00b7 The Group strives to maintain a 'zero-tolerance' position in relation to environmental, health and safety breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as criminally dishonest acts such as fraud, corruption, bribery and extortion.\n- \u00b7 The Group will minimise operational and IT risk, subject to cost-benefit trade-off.\n\nThe Management Risk Committee monitors the Group's risk profiles and regulatory compliance status on a quarterly basis.\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group's risk governance structure comprises three lines of defence that illustrates how specific duties related to risk and controls are assigned and coordinated within the Group, to facilitate timely risk identification, escalation, and provision of Board assurance.\n\n## First Line of Defence - Risk Owners -\n\nThe line managers of respective business and support functions are accountable and responsible for implementing and executing effective controls to manage the risks arising from their business activities. This includes establishing adequate managerial and supervisory controls to ensure compliance with policies, risk appetite, threshold limits and effective risk controls, and to highlight gaps, inadequacy of processes and unexpected risk events.\n\n## Second Line of Defence - ERM & Internal Audit -\n\nThe ERM function is responsible for designing, implementing and improving the risk management framework as part of the ERM and control assurance programme. The Internal Audit department provides independent assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management framework. Both functions are also responsible for the independent review and monitoring of the Group's risk profile and for highlighting any significant gaps and risk issues to the Management Risk Committee.\n\n## Third Line of Defence - Board Oversight -\n\nThe Board is responsible for the governance of risk across the Group, while ensuring that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) assists the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibility of overseeing the Group's risk management framework and policies. The Risk Management Committee surfaces significant risk issues for discussion with the ARC and the Board, to keep them fully informed in a timely and accurate manner. All ARC members, including the Chairman of the ARC, are independent non-executive directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group adopts an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process that enables systematic identification and prioritisation of all material risks. An integral part of the process towards effective risk management is the continuous communication and consultation with internal and external stakeholders. This enables the Group to understand the importance of risk management, to appreciate the decisions that are taken within the Group, and to implement the best policies and practices necessary for the benefit of the Group.\n\n## MATERIAL RISKS TO THE GROUP\n\nThe Group categorises its risk profiles into four key areas: Strategic, Treasury and Financial, Operational and Compliance, and Information Technology. These risks vary widely, with many being beyond the Group's control. The Group is committed to mitigate risk exposure through appropriate risk management strategies and adequate internal controls. Close monitoring and control processes, including the use of appropriate key risk and key performance indicators, are implemented to ensure the risk profiles are managed within the Group's risk appetite and tolerance limits.\n\n## Strategic Risk\n\nA large part of the Group's strategic risks comprise market-driven forces, evolving business landscapes, changing customer demands and disruptive innovations. The Group remains vulnerable to uncertainties in the major economies, the looming impact of COVID-19, implications from geopolitical developments, keen competition and pressure in the real estate and hospitality industry.\n\n## Market and Competition\n\nGiven the geographical diversity of our business, the Group is exposed to various levels of event risks in major economies, as well as in key financial and property markets. The Group's principal business operations, comprising property development, property investment and hotel operations, face significant competition across the diverse markets in which they operate, and the failure to compete effectively in terms of price, market positioning, product quality, and levels of service could adversely affect the Group's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Brand and Reputation\n\nThe Group's reputation is one of its most valuable assets, playing a major part in the continued success of the business. The assessment of reputational risk, due to the nature of this type of risk, is constantly evolving and dependent on numerous factors at any given point in time. It is therefore impossible to define all matters and circumstances which may pose reputational risk, or to set out all the considerations which should be applied as part of the decision-making process.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThe Group recognises climate change as one of the long-term key global risks that can potentially impact its assets, revenue, operations, supply chain, product design and stakeholder engagement, and  investor  communication.  Aside from physical risks arising from climate change, regulatory transition risks can result in stricter emission standards, increased carbon tax and water pricing, and stricter building design requirements. The Group prioritises ESG communication and reporting to proactively manage rising stakeholder capitalism, investor and consumer activism. In the face of climate change, climate-proofing its buildings for a low-carbon future is key to the Group's growth strategy.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring macroeconomic trends, market conditions, and developments, and formulating responses and pre-emptive strategies accordingly.\n- b) Leveraging on our market analytics and project delivery expertise to introduce quality products and innovative solutions to meet the evolving customer demands.\n- c) Strengthening our brand and competitiveness through product differentiation, market positioning, operational efficiency, transformation through innovation and creating new revenue generating platforms, as well as leveraging on a portfolio of distribution channel partners.\n- d) Diversifying portfolio across geographies, focusing on core markets and cities where the Group has operational scale, and where underlying economic fundamentals are more robust.\n- e) Distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services by focusing on delivering a seamless customer experience, including our loyalty programme, direct booking channels, and consumer-facing technology platforms and services, from the competition.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Undertaking active monitoring of both traditional and social media platforms, aggressively and promptly responding to and managing any undesirable situation(s) that may arise.\n- b) Raising the profile of our brands through marketing campaigns and strategic partnership to build brand equity.\n- c) Focusing on a customer-centric approach, and monitoring customer satisfaction closely through surveys, gathering of feedback, inspections and other forms of engagement.\n- d) Establishing brand standards that are designed to maintain a level of product consistency based on the brand collection to which a hotel belongs, whilst allowing flexibility in order to maintain the personality of the property.\n- e) Striving to avoid any situations and/or actions that could result in a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Implementing robust climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to accelerate efforts towards a low-carbon business model, such as setting validated carbon emissions reduction targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and pledging net zero operational carbon for CDL's managed buildings in Singapore by 2030.\n- b) Pushing the envelope in innovative green building technologies to enhance the resilience of our portfolio of assets against physical and transition risks posed by climate change. The Group continues to explore new frontiers in innovation and sustainable investing.\n- c) Disclosing CDL's management of climate-related risks using internationally recognised frameworks/ assessments, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) guidance documentation.\n- d) Completing two climate change scenario analyses in 2019 and 2020 as a means of testing the Group's strategic resilience against different plausible and science-based climate scenarios (4 o C vs 2 o C and 2 o C vs 1.5 o C).\n- e) Conducting a Supply Chain Risk study in 2019, and subsequently expanding it in 2020, to better prepare for the increasing physical and social challenges impacting the Group's supplies of materials and workers.\n- f) Raising the bar on proactive, transparent and prompt ESG communication and reporting via digital platforms.",

The Group adopts a rigorous project management process to ensure that project cost, quality and time objectives are met, and also has in place stringent pre-qualification and tendering procedures to appoint well-qualified vendors. Regular site visits are also conducted to closely monitor the progress of projects and manage potential risks of delays, poor workmanship and cost overruns.\n- c) Benchmarking our quality assurance processes against all industry standards. We voluntarily subscribe to the BCA Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) and Quality Mark (QM) Assessment System.\n\n## Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)\n\nThe Group is committed to be a socially and environmentally responsible organisation that  advocates  a  'Safe  and  Green' corporate culture. In this regard, it is of paramount importance that we maintain high environment, health and safety standards across the Group, particularly at the ground level.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs we seek new avenues of growth, a key differentiator alongside access to innovation will be the ability to attract and retain talent, including new skills and capabilities to stay future-ready. The loss of some or all our key executives or the inability to attract or retain the right people, could materially and adversely affect our business in the medium to long-term.\n\n## Data Privacy\n\nThe Group recognises that data privacy breaches  may  undermine  customer confidence and result in litigation from customers and/or regulatory fines and penalties.\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to applicable laws and regulations of the markets in which we operate in, such as anti-bribery, corruption, money laundering, terrorism financing, competition and data privacy, along with all other laws and regulations applicable to licensing and conducting of sales, leasing, construction, property development, asset management and hotel operations.\n\nIn  addition,  various  aspects  of  hotel operations  are  required  to  achieve compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ('PCI-DSS'), and failure to do so could result in penalties and/or withdrawal of credit card payment facilities.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Recognising customer and guest safety with the utmost priority.\n- b) Maintaining an integrated ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 EHS Management System (EHSMS) across our operations in Singapore (corporate office, managed buildings and construction sites), to manage the environmental impact of our operations and the safety, health and well-being of employees and workers.

While infectious diseases topped the chart in the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2021, climate change related crises-to which no one is immune-remain as catastrophic threats to humanity. 1\n\nGlobally, COVID-19 has accelerated the trend towards a more sustainable approach  to  investing.  With Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) indices and funds outperforming their peers, companies with strong ESG performances are proven to be better prepared to survive, adapt and thrive. Corporate boards and management are expected to intensify their focus on ESG issues as more investors are allocating capital with an ESG lens.\n\nAmidst the unprecedented disruptions posed by the pandemic, CDL's early integration of ESG best practices has served as a strong foundation for the Company to recover better and stronger.\n\nRecognised as a global sustainability leader and green building pioneer in Singapore's real estate sector, CDL has continued to raise the bar on ESG practices to be more resilient and future ready. Major disruptions such as a pandemic can hit companies with little lead time, and the ability to anticipate and tackle change is critical for survival and sustained growth. CDL's Integrated Sustainability Report 2021, aptly titled 'Advancing Change Resilience', will be substantiated with the Company's concrete actions taken in 2020 and its strategic plan moving forward.\n\n## 2020 IN REVIEW - ADVANCING CHANGE RESILIENCE\n\n## Standing Together with Stakeholders through COVID-19\n\nCDL's tenants in Singapore and overseas were significantly impacted by COVID-19, facing operating challenges and cash\n\nflow constraints. To help them tide over this difficult period, CDL committed over $40 million in property tax and rental rebates. Tenants facing severe cash flow issues were also offered more flexibility in rental payments. As CDL's valued partners, the Company will continue to engage them closely to help support and sustain their businesses.\n\nTo support vulnerable communities during the onset of COVID-19, CDL launched several community initiatives, including donating more than $400,000 to The Invictus Fund administered by Singapore's Community Chest. Through an internal fundraiser, CDL raised $88,000 for close to 1,500 migrant workers at its development projects, to provide them with necessities during Circuit Breaker.\n\n## Creating Safe and Healthy Spaces\n\nWith increased demands for safety and wellness by its building users, CDL implemented robust safety measures across  its  managed  properties, complementing  governmental guidelines when Singapore entered Circuit Breaker in April 2020.\n\nBesides conducting regular compliance checks on safe management measures across its properties, CDL has also deployed various technologies, including autonomous  Ultraviolet-C  (UVC) disinfection robots, automated thermal scanners, and indoor air quality sensors to create healthier and smarter buildings.\n\nThis  has  helped  create  a  safe environment for building occupants while increasing operational efficiency and minimising exposure risk for frontline cleaning staff. In December 2020, CDL launched the first-of-itskind contactless lift eCall solution at Republic Plaza using its proprietary smart building app, CityNexus, in collaboration with Otis Singapore.\n\n## More Robust ESG Policies and Guidelines for Greater Alignment in the Value Chain\n\nCDL's existing Human Rights Policy, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy, and Supplier Code of Conduct have been enhanced to align with the heightened standards and expectations of organisational practices within the Company and its suppliers. Building upon CDL's long-established EHS policy and green procurement guidelines, the  Company formalised a Green Building Policy to provide greener, safer, healthier and more inclusive environments for its building users.\n\nCDL also strengthened its longstanding commitment to biodiversity protection and  urban  greenery-including voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessment (BIA) on greenfield sites before construction since 2010-by formulating a dedicated Biodiversity Policy in 2020 that takes reference from National Parks Board's (NParks) and Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) new BIA guidelines.\n\n## Continued Recognition by Prominent Sustainability Rankings and Awards\n\nCDL's effective ESG integration has achieved a strong track record in leading global sustainability ratings and rankings. These include its longstanding inclusion in FTSE4Good Index Series (since 2002), MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes (since 2009 and 'AAA' rating since 2010), and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (since 2011).\n\nThe Company's continued progress in 2020 is widely recognised by prominent global rankings, including the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World by Corporate Knights, of which CDL was ranked the world's top  real  estate  company  for  two consecutive years in 2020 and 2021. It was also accorded Global Sector Leader (Diversified-Office/Retail-Listed)\n\n- 1 The Global Risks Report 2021 is based on the Global Risks Perception Survey 2020 and completed by over 840 members of the World Economic Forum's diverse leadership communities.",

This makes CDL the only company in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to score 'A' for corporate climate action for three consecutive years and water security for two consecutive years. Additionally, CDL was named one of the world's 50 Sustainability & Climate Leaders in a documentary hosted by Bloomberg.\n\n## Singapore Sustainability Academy A Hub for Sustainable Development Advocacy\n\nConceptualised and developed by CDL, the Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA) is the first ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility in Singapore dedicated to advocacy and capacity building for climate action and the collective achievement of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An extensive partnership involving six government agencies and 15 industry and non-governmental organisation partners, the SSA has become a hallmark of CDL's community engagement,  and  is  recognised as Singapore's leading knowledge and networking hub for sustainable development.\n\nDue to COVID-19, the SSA has gone virtual since April 2020 to continue promoting sustainable lifestyle practices through various workshops and forums open to Singapore and beyond. Last year, the Virtual SSA platform reached out to over 1,200 participants from over 25 countries, including Malaysia, Nigeria, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United States.\n\n## STRONG LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY\n\nCDL has established the longest history amongst Singapore companies to have a dedicated Sustainability department, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer  (CSO).  The  CSO  reports directly to the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC), which comprises three independent directors, and CDL's Executive Director and Group CEO. The BSC has direct advisory supervision on  CDL's  sustainability  strategy, material ESG issues, workplans and performance targets. It convenes at least twice annually to discuss CDL's sustainability plans and review its performance.  Throughout the year, the CSO updates the BSC on global and local ESG trends and CDL's ESG initiatives. The BSC is promptly updated on CDL's ESG performance through quarterly reports from the management.\n\nThe CSO chairs the Sustainability Committee, which comprises members across all departments and operational units in CDL. Heads of departments and their line managers are held accountable for their ESG performances, which are linked to their remuneration and appraisal.\n\nIn addition to annual sustainability reporting, CDL publishes an online quarterly  sustainability  report  at www.cdlsustainability.com .  This voluntary disclosure, since July 2017, has set benchmarks for the transparency and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF TOP 15 MATERIAL ESG ISSUES\n\nTo  address  changing  stakeholder expectations  and  to  future-proof its  business,  CDL  conducted  a comprehensive materiality study in 2020 ahead of schedule (the last biennial study was conducted in 2019).

For the definition of Major and Minor IR, please refer to the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) website .\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND PERFORMANCE\n\nCDL effectively enhances its natural capital by implementing robust policies and practices to mitigate its environmental impact. Under the company-wide Sustainability Committee, the Environment Sub-Committee identifies significant environmental aspects and manages impact that results from CDL's corporate operations, property development and facilities management activities. The Company continually tracks its material environmental aspects, which include carbon emissions, energy use, water use, and waste and resource management. The following charts detail CDL's environmental performance of its operations in Singapore excluding hotel properties, unless otherwise stated. Figures stated in the charts may not add up due to rounding of decimals.\n\n## Total Carbon Emissions from CDL's Operations in Singapore: Corporate Office, Managed Buildings and Construction Sites (Tonnes CO 2 e)\n\nIn accordance with Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, Scope 2 emissions are calculated using both locationbased and market-based methods. The  figures  shown  in  brackets represent  calculations  using  a market-based method and includes the reduction in emissions from the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total Carbon Emissions from CDL's Operations in Singapore and Six Key Subsidiaries (Tonnes CO 2 e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As affirmation of CDL's proactive human resource policies and practices, CDL was named one of the 'Best Companies to Work for in Asia' in 2020 by Business Media International's human resources publication, HR Asia.\n\nAs one of Singapore's earliest corporate signatories to pledge support to the UN Global Compact (UNGC), CDL has been upholding the principles on human rights and labour in its human resource practices. In addition, CDL has been a signatory of the Employers' Pledge of Fair Employment Practices with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices since 2008.\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety\n\nThe occupational health and well-being of CDL employees, as well as workers at construction sites and managed properties, is vital for CDL's long-term business viability.\n\nAs a result of various safety initiatives and engagement programmes with its builders and their workers, major and minor incident rates at CDL's\n\nmanaged buildings and construction sites remained well below the industry average in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, there was zero reportable injury 13 ,  fatality,  and  occupational disease involving employees at CDL's corporate office.\n\n## Job Creation and Employment\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, CDL hired a total of 415 employees for its operations headquartered in Singapore where most of its business in property development and  asset  management  is  based, excluding hotel properties.\n\n## Employee Retention\n\nCDL's successful employee engagement is evident from its employees' length of  service.  The  average  tenure  of CDL Corporate Office's employees is about 8.8 years and more than 54% of its employees have been with CDL for over five years. CDL Corporate Office's employee resignation rate of 7% continued to remain significantly lower than the national average of 18% in 2020. CDL experienced an involuntary turnover rate of about 4.1%, of which 1.2% is due to retirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee Turnover Rate (%) at CDL's Corporate Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Computation of annual employee turnover is based  on  cumulative  monthly  attrition  rate derived from the number of resignations for the month / headcount for the month.\n- + Extrapolated from MOM's website.\n\n## Training and Development\n\nIn 2020, CDL invested over $450,000 in training and development for its Corporate Office, more than 2.5 times the amount spent in 2019, and over 16,800 training hours were clocked. An average of 5.8 training days was achieved across the workforce. Due to WFH arrangements, CDL expanded its suite of online learning offerings for its workforce.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nCDL is committed to providing equal opportunities throughout employment. Its recruitment process adheres to strict guidelines on non-discrimination and fair treatment, regardless of gender, ethnicity,  religion,  or  age.  Women made up a significant 68% of CDL Corporate Office's workforce and 55% of department heads.

The Company has been actively initiating and providing sustained support to programmes that deliver  lasting  and  positive  impact, focusing on these key themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting Environmental Awareness and Zero Waste\n- \u00b7 Advocating  Best  Practices  in Sustainability\n- \u00b7 Empowering Youths and Women as Sustainability Champions\n- \u00b7 Supporting Singapore's Arts Scene\n- \u00b7 Caring for the Less Fortunate\n\n## Employee Volunteerism\n\nSince 1999, CDL's dedicated employeeled volunteering body, City Sunshine Club (CSC), has actively reached out to the less fortunate and underprivileged. CSC organises festive outings for its adopted beneficiaries, as well as monthly food distribution drives where employees distribute household necessities to low-income elderly living in rental flats. In 2020, the pandemic made it challenging to organise and participate in outreach events. Nonetheless, while adhering to social distancing measures, CDL employees achieved a participation rate of 28.4% and clocked more than 320 volunteer manhours.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nWith climate risk taking prominence in the market and the pandemic sparking renewed  interest  in  ESG-focused companies, investors are pivoting to conscious investing. Of note, in January 2021, BlackRock vowed to support the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 and sooner, issuing a blunt warning to 1,000 global chief executives of carbonintensive companies to lift their carbon game or be divested 14 . This followed its December 2020 announcement that it will come down even more harshly on climate offenders from 2021, as seen in BlackRock's new investment stewardship document.\n\nAs the world navigates uncharted waters in the wake of the pandemic and climate crisis,  the  Singapore  government announced its enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution and its LongTerm Low-Emissions Development Strategy to secure Singapore's future as a climate-resilient nation. Businesses are expected to play their part, and CDL certainly aims to intensify its climate action in 2021 to help achieve both global and national goals.\n\nIn the global race to a low-carbon future, CDL will remain steadfast in fulfilling its commitment to Decarbonisation, Digitalisation  &  Innovation,  and Disclosure.\n\n## Decarbonisation - Commitment to Green Buildings and a Low-Carbon Economy\n\nIn 2021, CDL was the first real estate developer in Singapore and the first major real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to sign the WorldGBC's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. By  joining  the  Commitment,  the Company is dedicated to achieving net zero operational carbon by 2030 for  its  new  and  existing  whollyowned  assets  and  developments under  its  direct  operational  and management control.\n\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, CDL will strive to reduce its carbon emissions, including retrofitting  its  managed buildings to further enhance energy efficiency and accelerating the transition to renewable energy. Plans are currently underway to roll out BCA Green Mark SLE-certified buildings in Singapore by 2023.\n\nIn  deepening  its  ambitious decarbonisation goals, CDL is reviewing its SBTi-validated GHG reduction targets to align with a 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenariocompliant  business  model.  This complements CDL's pledge of support to the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C led by the UNGC, SBTi and We Mean Business coalition, of which CDL was one of the pioneering 87 companies to sign on to the campaign in September 2019.\n\nAs a signatory to the WorldGBC's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, CDL is also a member of EP100, pledging to improve its energy productivity by deploying energy efficient technologies and practices.\n\nComplementing CDL's target to achieve net zero for its buildings by 2030, a new Smart, Sustainable and Super Low Energy (3S) Green Building Framework was established. An expansion of CDL's green procurement guidelines, this holistic framework is aligned with the BCA SLE building requirements, as well as international standards for advancing health and well-being in buildings.\n\nTo accelerate the sustainability agenda in Singapore, the Singapore Green Plan was unveiled on 10 February 2021. It entails a multi-ministry and 3P effort to  drive  ambitious  and  collective action through interventions such as increased carbon tax, stricter green building, energy efficiency and waste reduction policies. CDL has been a staunch supporter of the Singapore government's green initiatives. The Company will continue to work closely with like-minded partners as Singapore ramps up its sustainability drive.\n\n## Digitalisation & Innovation Driving Cutting-edge Green Building Technology Applications\n\nRiding on CDL's firm commitment to technological advancement and its recognition of innovation as one of the Company's top-voted material ESG issues since 2017, a dedicated Green Building & Technology Application team was set up in 2020. This aims to support the Company's intensifying efforts in the search and application of innovative solutions.\n\nWorking together with the Enterprise Innovation Committee, the team will contribute to the Company's strategy to apply cutting-edge technology to reduce its carbon footprint in the way it designs, builds, and manages assets. CDL is also set to advance circularity solutions in the years ahead, including studying the feasibility of adopting carbonabsorbing construction materials, as part of the Company's efforts to reduce embodied carbon.\n\n## Accelerating Healthy, Green and Smart Buildings\n\nToday, incorporating health considerations in a building's design is not just a luxury, but also a necessity. In 2020, 'Healthy Buildings' emerged as a new material issue and 'Occupational Health, Safety and Well-being' was rated as the top material issue for CDL.\n\nThrough CDL's Green Building Policy, CDL will continue to place a strong focus on the health performance of its buildings by designing buildings with the following thrusts: (i) create liveable and healthy buildings through thoughtful and intentional spaces by placing health and wellness at the centre of design and construction; (ii)  develop healthy and low-carbon buildings using materials that are safe and made with low embodied carbon; (iii)  promote  biophilic  design  by increasing connectivity to the natural environment through more exposure\n\nto greenery and nature; and (iv) create safe and accessible spaces for users of all abilities, which puts users' needs as a priority.\n\n## Disclosures - Unlocking Financial Value with Global Growth of ESG Investing\n\nThe  asset  management  industry weathered the COVID-19 crisis stronger than  many  in  2020.  Assets  under management worldwide rose to USD110 trillion. The robust performance of ESG funds and indices have fuelled the shift towards ESG investing stronger than ever. At the start of 2021, three quarters of institutional investors in Europe declared their plan to boycott non-ESG products within the next two years. One third of all assets under management in the US were held in sustainable investments 15 .\n\nGiven CDL's strong commitment to ESG integration for over two decades and its proven track record in sustainability, the Company is in a strong position to benefit from the fast-growing global sustainable investment and finance. Over  the  last  six  to  nine  months, engagement with sustainable investors and asset managers was exceptionally active. The trend is expected to continue. CDL looks forward to interacting with more investors to share CDL's ambitious ESG goals and business strategies set under the CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint.\n\nSustainable finance is seeing rapid growth in Asia over the last few years.

        "page_content": "## F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W\n\nWith the protracted COVID-19 global pandemic adversely impacting its business and operations and a challenging operating real estate environment in China, the Group reported a loss after tax and non-controlling interest of $1.9 billion for FY 2020 (FY 2019: PATMI of $564.6 million). Excluding one-off, non-cash impairments of $1.78 billion for losses attributable to its joint venture (JV) investment in Sincere Property Group (Sincere Property) in China, impairment losses for CDL's hotels and investment properties of $99.5 million and allowance for foreseeable losses for development projects of $35.0 million, the Group would have registered a profit before tax of $120.8 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $805.5 million).\n\nRevenue for FY 2020 declined by 38.5% to $2.1 billion (FY 2019: $3.4 billion). While all segments were impacted, the Group's hotel operations segment accounted for 81% of the decline, as the pandemic continued to spread with resurgence in some cities even amid border restrictions, lockdowns and other measures to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nThe Group registered a pre-tax loss of $1.8 billion for FY 2020 (FY 2019: Pre-tax profit of $754.1 million), largely attributable to its $1.8 billion investment in and loans to Sincere Property, which distorted the Group's FY 2020 results.\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\nRevenue decreased by $170.8 million to $965.9 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $1,136.7 million). This segment reported a pre-tax loss of $739.8 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: pre-tax gain of $378.1 million).\n\nProjects that contributed to both revenue and profit in FY 2020 include Whistler Grand,  The  Tapestry,  Amber  Park, Gramercy Park, New Futura, Hong Leong City Center (HLCC), Hongqiao Royal Lake, Park Court Aoyama The Tower, Phase 1 of Teddington Riverside in Borough of  Richmond  upon  Thames  and  100 Sydney Street project in Chelsea. Sales of residential properties in New Zealand and units in Zenith Residences by M&C also contributed to the Group's revenue and pre-tax profit for this segment. In accordance with the Group's policy of equity accounting for the results of its JVs, whilst\n\nrevenue from JV developments such as South Beach Residences, Boulevard 88, The Jovell and Forest Woods had not been consolidated into the Group's total revenue, the Group's share of profit arising from these JV developments had been included in pre-tax profit.\n\nThe decrease in revenue for FY 2020 was attributable to lower recognition of profits progressively for projects due to the slower construction progress due to COVID-19, and FY 2019 contribution included a larger contribution from high-end projects which commanded higher profit margins such as New Futura and Gramercy Park. The decrease is slightly offset by higher progressive contribution from Whistler Grand and Amber Park due to higher percentage of completion achieved, higher contribution from the Teddington Riverside and maiden contribution from 100 Sydney Street in London, UK.\n\nThe substantial pre-tax loss recognised for FY 2020 was due to losses attributable to the Group's investment in Sincere Property. Excluding the impact of Sincere Property, this segment would have reported a pre-tax gain of $219.8 million for FY 2020.\n\nThe decrease in pre-tax profit for FY 2020 (excluding the impact of Sincere Property) was in tandem with the decrease in revenue, coupled with thinner margins for The Tapestry, Whistler Grand and Amber Park, the main contributors for FY 2020. In addition, there was lower share of profit from South Beach Residences, a joint venture project due to lower sales volume, and lower returns recognised from the sales of units in the Ivy and Eve project in Australia which was fully sold in 2019. In addition, the Group made an allowance for foreseeable losses of $35.0 million on its development properties, vis-\u00e0-vis a $6.5 million write-back in FY 2019.\n\n## HOTEL OPERATIONS\n\nRevenue for this segment decreased $1,064.6 million to $640.4 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $1,705.0 million). This segment reported a pre-tax loss of $573.4 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $6.6 million).\n\nExcluding the impact of Sincere Property, this segment would have reported a pre-tax loss of $466.8 million for FY 2020.\n\nThe  prolonged  COVID-19  pandemic continues to have a profound impact on the Group's hotel operations. Widespread travel restrictions and lockdowns of cities since March 2020 had resulted in an unprecedented collapse in global tourism and travel. In the second half of the year, while some nations see recovery in the hospitality sector due to gradual lifting of travel restrictions and implementation of domestic travel initiatives, others such as the United States and United Kingdom experience a resurgence of the outbreak, triggering  second  and  subsequent lockdowns. The hotels results were also impacted by the civil unrest in the United States regarding racial injustice and travel strikes in Paris.\n\nImpairment losses made by the Group of $87.0 million (FY 2019: $58.2 million) on its hotel properties during the year also contributed to the loss for this segment.\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nRevenue for this segment decreased by $76.7 million to $361.4 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $438.1 million). This segment reported a pre-tax loss of $575.0 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: pre-tax gain of $332.9 million).\n\nThe decrease in FY 2020 revenue was largely due to rental rebates provided to retail tenants, as well as lower revenue for hotels under the master lease structure for CDLHT Group, where operations were severely impacted by the pandemic.\n\nThe substantial pre-tax loss recognised for FY 2020 was due to losses attributable to the Group's investment in Sincere Property. Excluding the impact of Sincere Property, this segment would have reported a pre-tax profit of $135.8 million for FY 2020.\n\nExcluding the loss attributable to Sincere Property, pre-tax profit for this segment for FY 2020 declined mainly due to lower divestment gains recognised, impairment losses recognised on investment properties and higher financing cost incurred. In July 2020, the Group (through CDLHT Group) completed the sale of Novotel Clarke Quay to a joint venture consortium held by the Group and CapitaLand Limited and recognised a gain of $107.9 million on the sale. The Group also recognised a gain of\n\n$9.4 million on the divestment of Novotel Brisbane in October 2020. Divestment gains in FY 2019 was higher where the Group realised deferred gain on sale of investment properties of $153.9 million and $52.6 million of distributions from Golden Crest upon the successful unwinding of the PPS 2 platform. The Group also recognised a $10.5 million gain from the divestment of a vacant land parcel at Jervois Road in July 2019.\n\nDuring the year, based on assessment done by external valuers, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $12.0 million on two\n\ninvestment properties located in Italy and the Maldives. On the other hand, the Group wrote back $2.4 million of impairment loss on two investment properties located in the Maldives in FY 2019.\n\n## OTHERS\n\nRevenue, comprising mainly income from building maintenance contracts, project management, club operations, laundry services and dividend income, decreased by $8.2 million to $140.6 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $148.8 million). The decrease was due to lower project management fees and club income earned.\n\n## Revenue by Business Segment ($ Million)\n\nProfit Before Tax by Business Segment* ($ Million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPre-tax profit increased $47.7 million to $97.4 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $49.7 million). Despite a marginal decrease in revenue, pre-tax profit for FY 2020 increased mainly due to higher contribution derived from FSGL's property financing business, backed by higher income from refinancing loans. In addition, the Group also recognised a $23.5 million divestment gain on Sceptre Hospitality Resources and lower mark-to-market loss on certain quoted securities held by the Group.\n\n## Revenue By Business Segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Profit Before Tax by Business Segment* (%)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Asymptomatic in nature yet lethal in  its  impact,  the  pandemic was a rude awakening as governments and businesses grappled with relentless challenges  on  public  health  and safety, protecting the social fabric while also trying to revitalise an ailing economy laden with deep uncertainties. The magnitude and ferocity of the impact were unprecedented.\n\nThe  Group  had  to  embrace  these disruptions and swiftly adapt to the changes. From the mobilisation of evolving  safe  distancing  measures, strengthening its digital platforms, helping its stakeholders tide over this challenging period, to pivoting new ways of doing business - the Group worked diligently to reposition its business model.\n\nBeyond the pandemic, 2020 posed other unprecedented structural and policy challenges beyond the Group's control. Two of the Group's largest investments - its Sincere Property Group (Sincere Property) joint venture (JV) and whollyowned hospitality subsidiary, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) - bore the brunt of the combined impact, affecting their liquidity and operations, respectively.\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Singapore\n\nECs, with a total sales value of $1.8 billion (FY 2019: 1,554 units with a total sales value of $3.3 billion).\n\nSingapore's economy contracted by 5.4% in 2020, a reversal from the 1.3% growth recorded in 2019. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has forecasted a gradual recovery for the Singapore economy, although the outlook remains uneven across sectors. Singapore's economic growth for 2021 is expected to be within a range of between 4% and 6%, against the backdrop of external uncertainties and risks. The hardest hit sectors such as aviation and tourismrelated trades are expected to continue to see contraction due to global travel restrictions and weak external demand.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  challenging environment, the residential market remained relatively resilient, registering a price increase of 2.2% for 2020, based on data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). This was largely due to pent-up demand, following the lifting of Circuit Breaker movement restrictions, and supported by a low interest rate environment.\n\nFor the whole of 2020, private home sales increased slightly by 0.7% as developers sold a total of 9,982 units (excluding Executive Condominiums or ECs), compared with 9,912 units sold in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, the Group and its JV associates sold 1,318 residential units including\n\nOverall, the sales are comparable with 2019, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic in 1H 2020. The lower sales value was due to more upgrader and mid-segment projects like Whistler Grand, Piermont Grand and Penrose sold, compared to sales from higher-end projects like New Futura, Boulevard 88 and Amber Park in the previous year.\n\nFor the year under review, the Group launched  Penrose,  a  566-unit  JV project located at Sims Drive, near Aljunied MRT station, in September. The response was overwhelming, with over 60% of the units sold during the launch weekend, making it one of the best-selling launches in 2020. The project is now 74% sold at an average selling price (ASP) of over $1,570 per square foot (psf)*. Projects launched in 2019 also continued to sell well.\n\nForest Woods, the Group's 519-unit JV project located near Serangoon MRT station, obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) in November 2020. This project is now fully sold.\n\nTo replenish its land bank, in January 2020, the Group successfully tendered for  a  137,634  square  feet  (sq  ft) Government Land Sales (GLS) prime site at Irwell Bank Road for $583.9 million (or $1,515 psf per plot ratio).\n\n## Healthy Uptake for Existing Inventory of Projects Launched in 2019\n\n| Project Location   | Boulevard 88 # Orchard Boulevard   | Amber Park Amber Road   | # Haus on Handy Handy Road   | Piermont Grand # Sumang Walk   | Nouvel 18 ~ Anderson Road   | Sengkang Grand  Residences # Sengkang Central   |            |            |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Tenure             | Freehold                           | Freehold                | 99 years                     | 99 years                       |                             | Freehold                                        | 99 years   |            |\n| Equity Stake (%)   | 40%                                | 80%                     | 100%                         | 60%                            |                             | -                                               |            | 50%        |\n| Units Units Sold*  | 154 107                            | 592 265                 | 188 39                       | 820 714                        | 156 71                      |                                                 | 680        | 358        |\n| ASP*               | > $3,770 psf                       | > $2,470 psf            | > $2,840 psf                 | >                              | $1,100 psf                  | >                                               | $3,380 psf | $1,730 psf |\n\n- * As at 21 February 2021\n- # JV project\n- ~ Divested project marketed by CDL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSingapore's  residential  market continues to show signs of recovery. New private home sales in January 2021 surged to their highest for the month in eight years, as developers successfully rolled out several new launches. To ensure that the Group has sufficient stock in the pipeline, it is preparing to launch two new projects this year.\n\nThe first is Irwell Hill Residences, conveniently located near Great World shopping mall and the upcoming Great World MRT station. This prime District 9 development will comprise two elegant 36-storey towers with a total of 540 units. It is expected to be launched in Q2 2021.\n\nThe second project slated for launch in 2H 2021 is the residential component of the Liang Court JV redevelopment project with a 48-storey and a 24-storey tower with a total of 696 units (CanningHill Piers). The mixed-used integrated development will also comprise a 21-storey Moxy hotel (475 keys), a 20-storey Somerset serviced residence (192 keys) and a 2-storey commercial podium (CanningHill Square). Located in the heart of Clarke Quay, the site has a coveted dual frontage facing the Singapore River and Fort Canning Hill. When completed, the development will have a direct connection to the Fort Canning MRT station of the Downtown line.  The  timely  redevelopment  of this mature asset and rejuvenation of the river promenade beside it will complement the revitalisation of the Singapore River planning area.\n\nTo capitalise on the Government's initiatives to rejuvenate older assets in the CBD with enhanced plot ratios, the Group is progressing with plans to redevelop its Fuji Xerox Towers with a potential uplift of 25% GFA. Located near Tanjong Pagar MRT station and the upcoming Prince Edward MRT station, the proposed redevelopment will  comprise a 47-storey mixeduse  integrated  development  with residential, office, retail and serviced apartment uses. The asset offers great potential, stemming from its prime location at the gateway to the Greater Southern Waterfront masterplan by the Government.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL\n\n## Australia\n\nThe  Group's  Brickworks  Park development, consisting of 222 units of apartments and townhouses located in Alderley, North Brisbane, will be launched in two stages. Stage 1 was soft launched in September 2020. To date, 35 units out of the 132 released have been sold*.\n\nThe Marker, a 198-unit JV residential project located on Spencer Street, West Melbourne, has exchanged contracts on 77% of the apartments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Group's collaboration with  Waterbrook  Lifestyle  for  a retirement village project in Bowral in New South Wales, has exchanged contracts on 74% of the 77 townhouses launched.\n\n## Japan\n\nAll 160 units at Park Court Aoyama The Tower in Tokyo, a freehold JV residential project, have been handed over to buyers as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## UK\n\nExpanding into UK's Private Rented Sector (PRS) sector, the Group has obtained full planning permission for its freehold site in Leeds. It plans to develop a 665-unit for-rent residential project with retail space located within the site's attractive heritage arches beneath a viaduct. Construction has commenced and expected to complete in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

HCP Cayman holds a 100% equity interest in HCP HK, which in turn holds an 80.01% interest in Sincere Property. This represented the Group's expansion into the China property market as the Group continues to hold a long-term view of its investments in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and remains confident of the PRC's strong fundamentals and ability to rebound.\n\nThis  followed  the  initial  strategic investment  in  Sincere  Property announced  in  May  2019  for  RMB 5.5  billion,  comprising  a  24% stake  and  interest-bearing  loans. The  Group's  intention  to  invest Sincere Property started back in 2019 with  the  engagement  of  HSBC  as financial advisors for this investment. The Group also appointed legal advisors and a reputable accounting firm for the legal, tax and financial due diligence of\n\nthe significant companies within the Sincere Property Group as part of its due diligence process.\n\nIn June 2019, the Group subscribed for US$230 million ($305 million) of USD bonds issued by Sincere Property. The bonds have a 3-year term maturing on 27 June 2022.\n\nGiven the adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the global uncertainty, CDL took the opportunity to renegotiate the terms for its investment into Sincere Property in April 2020 and the purchase consideration of $882 million (RMB 4.39 billion) was based on an agreed valuation of Sincere Property at RMB 8.6 billion. In addition, the Group has a call option to acquire an additional 9.0% effective equity interest in Sincere Property, which is exercisable at the Group's discretion within a 6-month period commencing on the later of the first business day after the expiry of 18 months from acquisition completion of the acquisition price payment date or 1 July 2022, at the same valuation of RMB 8.6 billion.\n\nThe unaudited financial statements of Sincere Property prepared under PRC GAAP as at 30 April 2020 reported a Net Asset Value (NAV) of RMB 15.4 billion (Audited NAV under PRC GAAP as of 31 December 2019: RMB 16.0 billion).\n\nIn 1H 2020, the Group carried out a preliminary purchase price allocation (PPA) (prior to the completion of the audit of the acquisition balance sheet of HCP Cayman). The Revalued Net Asset Value (RNAV) of the net identifiable assets of HCP Cayman were valued at  RMB 9 billon based on Sincere Property's unaudited April 2020 financial statements adjusted for valuations of its properties based on draft valuation reports by Cushman and Wakefield. Accordingly, the Group recognised the following in 1H 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 $43.2 million of negative goodwill for its 51.01% effective joint controlling interest  in  Sincere  Property  in 1H 2020.\n- \u00b7 a mark to market fair value gain on the call option of $7.7 million.\n- \u00b7 share of loss of $41 million arising from equity accounting Sincere Property.\n\nIn  June 2020, the Group advanced a RMB 650 million working capital ($132 million) loan to Sincere Property.\n\nOn 2 July 2020, the joint venture holding company of Sincere Property, HCP HK, took a loan from a financial institution of RMB 1.5 billion ($283 million). Both the ultimate shareholders of HCP HK, being the Group and the founder of Sincere Property, provided guarantees and securities for this loan.\n\nIn September 2020, the Group provided a liquidity support undertaking for a tranche of Sincere Property bonds due in October 2020. The total amount of the bonds principal and interest due was RMB 1.512 billion, for which the full amount was called upon in October 2020. RMB 0.19 billion was subsequently repaid by Sincere Property, leaving the balance owing at RMB 1.322 billion ($269 million).\n\nIn addition, the Group further equity accounted for another $35 million share of loss arising from Sincere Property in Q3 2020.\n\nAccordingly, the share of loss that was equity accounted by the Group up to YTD September 2020 amounted to $76 million.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group provided a short term RMB 18.8 million loan ($4 million) to Sincere Property which was repaid on 24 February 2021.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, Sincere Property has faced immense liquidity headwinds, exacerbated by the 'three red lines' policy announced by Chinese authorities to curb lending to real estate developers. Since late 2020, the Group has commenced a strategic review which involves restructuring the platform. The Group's special working group will work with Sincere Property, with the assistance of Deloitte China, to improve liquidity and restructure its existing loans and liabilities. The operating environment remains volatile and fluid. The special working group is exploring all options in formulating its recovery plan while limiting any additional financial exposure by the Group.\n\nOn  22  February  2021,  the  Group announced its first major corporate action to improve the liquidity of Sincere Property: the acquisition of equity interests in a Shenzhen technology park project, Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park ( \u6df1\u5733\u9f99\u5c97\u533a\u542f\u8fea\u534f\u4fe1\u79d1\u6280\u56ed ), which  provides  the  Group  with  a combined 55% effective interest in this large-scale development in China's high-growth 'Silicon Valley'. The site comprises offices (about 70%), SOHO apartments (about 20%), 4,887 carpark lots and retail/others (about 10%). The project is being developed in four phases, of which Phase 1 is completed while Phase 2 and 3 are under construction with expected completion in April 2022. Phase 4 (self-held office block) has not yet commenced construction.\n\nFor this transaction, the Group acquired a total of 84.6% equity interest in the project from Sincere Property and two entities of China Ping An (Ping An; \u4e2d\u56fd\u5e73\u5b89 )  in  Shenzhen  Tusincere Technology Park Development Co. Ltd. (the Holdco; \u6df1\u5733\u542f\u8fea\u534f\u4fe1\u79d1\u6280 \u56ed\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ) for RMB 850 million (approximately  $174  million)  and will assume its proportionate share of existing shareholders' loans. The Holdco controls 65% interest in the project, which was valued at RMB 8.8 billion (approximately $1.81 billion) by  independent  valuer,  Cushman &  Wakefield.  The  remaining  35% equity interest in the project is held by Shenzhen Longgang District stateowned enterprise ( \u6df1\u5733\u9f99\u5c97\u533a\u5546\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1 \u96c6\u56e2\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ).",

With pro-active leasing and tenant retention, committed occupancy of the Group's office portfolio - comprising 11 properties with Net Lettable Area (NLA) of 1.7 million sq ft - improved to 92.2% as at 31 December 2020, higher than the national average of 88.2%. The Group's flagship office building Republic Plaza has a committed occupancy of above 96%.\n\nOccupancy for the Group's retail portfolio remains resilient at 92.2%. Despite the lower footfall in the malls, the full year Gross Turnover (GTO) of the Group's malls managed to narrow the decline to approximately 15% drop y-o-y by end-2020. This is largely contributed by the strong performance of the F&B outlets in Palais Renaissance and Quayside Isle, which achieved full year GTO increases of over 10% despite the two-month Circuit Breaker closure (April to May 2020). To provide tenants with an alternative sales channel, CDL eMall, an online retail and F&B sales and delivery platform, was launched in December 2020.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL\n\n## Japan\n\nIn September 2020, the Group acquired a forward-funded rental apartment PRS project - a 78-unit property named City Lux Yokohama. The property was completed in August 2020 and achieved a 61.5% occupancy rate within three months of completion.\n\nThe Group's remaining four PRS projects in  Osaka Japan, have achieved an average occupancy rate of 98%.\n\n## UK\n\nIn 2020, the Group embarked on several asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) and feasibility studies on its UK assets located in Central London. For Aldgate House, these involved repurposing the basement and mezzanine spaces into a basement gym completed in Q2 2020. Leasing of this basement gym space (10,084 sq ft) is in progress. The formalising planning consent for the proposed restaurant use on the ground floor is expected by Q1 2021. From a long-term perspective, studies have also been undertaken to explore increasing the property's NLA by expanding offices to the rear and new retail frontage. The property is currently well occupied at 86.8% and has strong potential for positive rental reversions.\n\nFor  125  Old  Broad  Street,  initial feasibility studies have been carried out to significantly enhance the end of trip facilities, increasing the potential for reduced void periods and strong long-term rental growth, which have already been boosted by the ongoing refurbishment of the vacant offices.\n\n## China\n\nThe  Group  has  two  commercial properties in Hongqiao, Shanghai. Hong Leong Plaza Hongqiao, a fivetower office building, has fully leased its office space for use as serviced apartments, a confinement centre and aesthetic clinic with long leases to generate stable recurring income. Hong Leong Hongqiao Center's office space is about 63% occupied. The serviced apartments are also relatively resilient despite the pandemic.\n\n## HOSPITALITY\n\nThe magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis on the hospitality industry, compounded by a severe global economic downturn is  unprecedented, and the Group's hospitality portfolio - which comprises mainly assets owned and managed by M&C - remains vulnerable to the evolving situation. The Group's focus has been to\n\nmanage prudently near-term operational and cashflow requirements to fund its operations and ride out this crisis.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's hospitality portfolio comprises 152 hotels, of which 68 hotels (45%) are owned by the Group, 19 hotels (12%) are operated under JV arrangements or under its REIT associate, CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), and the balance (43%) are managed or franchised hotels.\n\nThe  Group's  hospitality  portfolio was significantly impacted by global lockdowns and ongoing border closures and travel restrictions over the past year. In constant currency, global revenue per available room (RevPAR) for FY 2020 fell 64.5% to $52.9 (FY 2019: $149.1), while room occupancy fell 35.7% to 38.6% (FY 2019: 74.3%). For Asia, RevPAR for FY 2020 was $55.4 (FY 2019: $135.1), while RevPAR for Europe and US was $33.1 (FY 2019: $147.9) and $58.7 (FY 2019: $173.5) respectively. Australasia showed the  most  resilience  with  domestic travel in focus, with RevPAR at $72.9 (FY 2019: $129.4).\n\nWith  minimal  inbound  business, occupancies in most Singapore and New Zealand (NZ) hotels were partially mitigated by Government quarantine business and local government contracts for isolation programme respectively. Demand for the North Asia hotels has started to recover in domestic and retail markets as cities gradually lift national and regional travel restrictions.\n\nIn the second half of 2020, regional UK started to recover ahead of London, but was subsequently impacted again by the second and third waves of COVID-19 infections. The Group's hotels in Paris and Rome remained closed since March 2020.\n\nThe US continues to be the hardest hit, with the greatest number of infection cases  and  continuing  restrictions on  travel  and  business  openings, compounded by civil and political unrest in many cities.\n\nNew York (NY) hotel occupancies were severely impacted with approximately 40% of the Group's hotels closed. Novotel Times Square was closed on 25 March 2020. The Group's other three NY hotels secured medical-related business as well as served essential workers to mitigate the losses.\n\nIn 1H 2020, Copthorne King's Hotel in Singapore completed the renovation of 142 rooms at the Tower Wing. After completing refurbishment, Copthorne Hotel and Resort Queenstown Lakefront, New Zealand, reopened in Q4 2020.\n\nThe Group is progressing with its plans to develop the Sunnyvale California project comprising a 263-room M Social hotel and a 250-unit residential block. It hopes to capitalise on Sunnyvale's strategic location as the headquarters of many technology companies and California's high-tech area of Silicon Valley. Construction for the apartment block has commenced and completion is expected in 2022.\n\nTo unlock value from its hotel portfolio, the  Group  had  also  embarked  on four asset divestments in Malaysia, Singapore, the UK and the US for the year under review. The sale of Millennium Cincinnati was completed on 14 February 2020 for US$36 million (approximately $49 million) with a\n\ndisposal gain of $26.0 million. The sale of W Singapore - Sentosa Cove hotel to CDLHT for $324 million was completed on 16 July 2020.\n\nIn December 2013, as a result of a compulsory purchase order by the Birmingham  City  Council  for  the Copthorne Hotel Birmingham, the Group entered into various commercial arrangements with Birmingham City Council and Paradise Circus Limited Partnership (PCLP), the developer of  Birmingham's  Paradise  Circus redevelopment scheme. The Group will be exercising its put option to sell the existing site to PCLP for \u00a317.2 million ($30.8 million) and expects to complete this in Q3 2021.\n\nThe Group entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement in December 2020 to sell Copthorne Orchid Hotel & Resort Penang in Malaysia for RM 75 million (approximately $25 million), with a pretax gain on disposal of $9.2 million. The deal is expected to close in Q2 2021.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to evaluate divestment opportunities in M&C's portfolio where appropriate. However, our priority is to improve M&C's hotel performance and to explore alternative uses that complement the Group's real estate capabilities, so as to build a stronger recurring income base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FUND MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Group is actively pursuing growth of  its  fund  management  business organically  or  via  mergers  and acquisitions.\n\nIn April 2020, the Group acquired an additional 8.4% stake in Singapore-listed IREIT Global, a pan-European real estate investment trust listed in Singapore. In October 2020, it supported IREIT's fund-raising exercise, increasing its stake to 21% of the total issued units. The Group currently has a 50% stake in the REIT manager. IREIT's AUM grew 43% from \u20ac 504.9 million (approximately $813.0 million) (at the point of investment by the Group in April 2019) to \u20ac 719.6 million (approximately $1.1 billion) as at 31 December 2020. It remains confident about the long-term fundamentals of the established European economies.\n\nThe Group is accelerating its plans to establish a Singapore-listed REIT with UK commercial assets. Discussions with banks, partners and various stakeholders are at an advanced stage. Details such as the properties to be injected and the size of the offering are being deliberated. The timeline is subject to market conditions.\n\n## GETTING RENEWED\n\nOver  the  decades,  the  Group  has recovered from each crisis and emerged stronger than before. Its balance sheet and financial health remain strong.\n\nMoving into 2021, it will continue to display resilience, management expertise and its proven ability to seize opportunities. On the back of global vaccine deployment, and collective efforts to reopen some borders, the Group remains optimistic that there is light at the end of this storm, and it will recover from this one-off dislocation.\n\nAs the global economy recovers from the effects of the pandemic, the Group will continuously tweak and execute on  its  Growth,  Enhancement  and Transformation (GET) strategy to propel recovery and accelerate growth.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial  statements  of  the  current  period.  These  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the  financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Accounting for the Group's investment in HCP Chongqing Property Development Co., Ltd\n\n- a) Accounting for the acquisition of HCP Chongqing Property Development Co., Ltd ('HCP') and impairment of equity investment in HCP\n\n(Refer to note 9 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nIn April 2020, the Group acquired an equity interest of 63.75% in HCP, an investment holding company which indirectly owns  Chongqing  Sincere  Yuanchuang  Industrial  Co.,  Ltd.  ('Sincere  Property  Group'),  a  real  estate  developer in  China,  for  an  aggregate  consideration  of  approximately  $0.9  billion.  This  acquisition  represents  a  significant transaction for the Group and was accounted for as a business combination and an investment in a joint venture.\n\nThere is judgement involved in determining whether the acquisition is a business combination or asset acquisition. Where an acquisition is accounted for as a business combination, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed,  including  any  contingent  liabilities  (purchase  price allocation or 'PPA'). Significant judgement is involved in estimating the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resultant goodwill.\n\n## I N D E P E N D E N T A U D I T O R S '   R E P O R T\n\nThe Group engaged an independent valuer to determine the fair values of the underlying properties held by HCP and its subsidiaries ('HCP Group'). A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to HCP Group's underlying property portfolio comprising development properties, property, plant and equipment and investment properties, based on the valuation amounts in the independent valuation reports. The valuation of development properties is critically dependent upon the estimated future selling prices. The valuation of property, plant and equipment and investment properties involves significant judgement in determining both the valuation methods to be used and the key assumptions to be applied. The valuations are sensitive to the key assumptions applied and a change in assumptions may have a significant impact on the valuations.\n\nIn  addition,  included  in  the  assets  of  HCP  Group  were  amounts  due  from  related  parties  of  HCP  Group  at  the acquisition completion date. The valuation of these amounts due from related parties of HCP Group, which takes into consideration the amounts that will be recoverable from the related parties, involves significant judgement.\n\nJudgement is also involved in estimating the fair value of contingent liabilities (mainly financial guarantees issued to lenders for credit facilities granted to HCP Group's related parties) recognised as part of the PPA, which takes into consideration the probability that the HCP Group will have to fulfil its obligations under the financial guarantees.\n\nThe PPA exercise indicated that the Group's cost of investment in HCP of $0.9 billion represents goodwill.\n\nSubsequent to the acquisition, the Group identified indicators of impairment on its equity investment in HCP arising from the challenging macro-economic environment posed by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ('COVID-19') pandemic, the credit tightening measures imposed on China's real estate sector and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group. Accordingly, the Group undertook an assessment of the recoverable amount of the investment in HCP. Judgement is involved in estimating the recoverable amount and any consequential impairment loss on the equity investment in HCP. In estimating the recoverable amount of the investment, the Group had considered the financial position of the HCP Group which took into consideration the fair values of its underlying assets and liabilities.\n\nTaking into account the above considerations and developments and based on the assessment undertaken, the Group impaired the equity investment in HCP fully.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe reviewed the sale and purchase agreements and related transaction documents to understand the terms of the acquisition to determine if the acquisition is a business combination. Together with our valuation specialist, we discussed with management their basis for identifying the assets and liabilities acquired and valuing the identified assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities.\n\nIn respect of the valuation of the property portfolio, we inspected the valuation reports prepared by the independent valuers. We considered the valuation methodologies used against generally accepted market practices for similar property types. For development properties, we focused our work on projects with slower-than-expected sales or with low or negative margins. We evaluated the estimated future selling prices by comparing to recent transacted prices for the relevant properties and prices of comparable properties located in the same vicinity, where available. For property, plant and equipment and investment properties, we evaluated the key assumptions applied in the valuations  by  comparing  them  against  historical  rates  and  available  industry  data,  taking  into  consideration comparability and market factors.\n\nIn respect of the valuation of the amounts due from related parties of the HCP Group, we considered the repayment patterns as well as the settlement arrangements agreed between the HCP Group and its related parties.\n\nIn respect of the valuation of contingent liabilities, we assessed the basis for the assumptions applied by management in estimating the fair values through enquiries with management, and reviewing their assessment of the probability of the financial guarantees being invoked as well as the supporting calculations for the amounts recognised.\n\nWe reviewed the Group's estimate of the recoverable amount of its investment in HCP, taking into consideration the financial position of HCP Group and the other indicators identified by management.",

A fair value adjustment was made for the remaining amount where recoverability could not be reasonably ascertained.\n\nThe fair values of the contingent liabilities were estimated by the Group taking into consideration the available information on the financial positions of the parties for which financial guarantees were issued and applying a probability of default based on empirical studies.\n\nThe impairment of the equity investment in HCP was based on available financial and market information on the HCP Group.\n\n## b) Impairment of investment in bonds issued by Sincere Property Group and loans to HCP\n\n(Refer to notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group has:\n\n- (i) an investment in a bond issued by Sincere Property Group, amounting to $0.3 billion (the 'Sincere Bond'); and\n- (ii) loans extended to and interest receivable from HCP Group, amounting to $0.4 billion (the 'HCP Loans').\n\nAs set out in notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements, the Group assessed that the Sincere Bond and the HCP Loans were credit-impaired, having considered past repayment trends, the debt maturity profile of Sincere Property Group, the default risk on the Sincere Bond and the HCP Loans and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nIn estimating the expected credit losses to be recognised on the investment in the Sincere Bond and HCP Loans, the Group considered the adjusted financial position of Sincere Property Group (taking into account the estimated recoverable amounts of the properties held by Sincere Property Group and its associates and joint ventures and potential  additional  costs  to  be  incurred  on  borrowings  of  Sincere  Property  Group),  the  debt  profile  of  Sincere Property Group, the value of collateral that the Group holds and certain amounts owing by the Group to HCP Group.\n\nThe Group recorded total expected credit losses of $0.6 billion on the investment in the Sincere Bond and the HCP Loans.\n\nThe expected credit losses recognised on the Sincere Bond and the HCP Loans require the Group to make its best estimate of the amounts recoverable from the HCP Group which involves significant judgement and subjectivity. Changes to the estimates applied in deriving the expected credit losses may impact the amount of such losses being recognised.\n\n## Our response\n\nTogether with our valuation specialist, we independently assessed the reasonableness of the expected credit losses recognised on the Sincere Bond and the HCP Loans, taking into consideration the yields on other bonds issued by Sincere Property Group.\n\nWe also evaluated the discounts applied on the properties held by Sincere Property Group and its associates and joint ventures in deriving the adjusted financial position of Sincere Property Group by comparing to market data, where available. In addition, we assessed the interest rate assumptions made in relation to potential additional interest costs to be incurred on the borrowings of Sincere Property Group based on the underlying agreements, where appropriate. In respect of the HCP Loans, we also assessed the reasonableness of the fair value of the collateral held by the Group by comparing to the recently transacted price for the collateral.\n\n## Our findings\n\nThe  impairment  losses  recorded  on  the  Sincere  Bond  and  the  HCP  Loans  did  not  differ  materially  from  our assessment of the estimated impairment losses, based on the prevailing circumstances and available market data at the date of issuance of the financial statements.\n\n## c) Provision for financial guarantee issued\n\n(Refer to notes 9 and 28 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nDuring 2020, the Group had issued a financial guarantee of approximately $0.3 billion to a financial institution in connection with a loan taken up by the HCP Group. The Group has considered the probability that the financial guarantee will be invoked and recognised a provision for the full amount of the guarantee, taking into account the available financial information of HCP Group, Sincere Property Group not repaying the principal amounts of certain bonds on their maturities post 31 December 2020, the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group and legal advice received.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe  evaluated  the  Group's  basis  for  the  provision  on  the  financial  guarantee  based  on  the  available  evidence, including evidence provided by events after the reporting date and legal advice received by the Group.\n\n## Our findings\n\nThe carrying value of the provision for the financial guarantee is reasonable.",

The identified properties are then subjected to a detailed impairment review whereby their recoverable amounts are estimated.\n\nThe Group uses a combination of internal and external valuations to estimate the recoverable amount of its properties identified as at risk of being impaired, which is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and valuein-use of these properties. The valuations are sensitive to key assumptions applied and a change in the assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amounts.\n\nThe valuation reports obtained from the external valuers for certain hotels also highlighted that arising from the COVID-19 pandemic giving rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty, and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to their valuations than would normally be the case. Due to the uncertainty that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have also recommended to keep the valuation of these properties under frequent review.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures included challenging the Group's assessment of the properties at risk of being impaired. These include comparing the actual asset performance to previous forecasts and to market data, and assessing the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations. For a sample of properties selected for a detailed impairment review, we considered the valuation method used against those applied by valuers for similar property types. We evaluated the key assumptions applied in the internal and external valuations, particularly those assumptions relating to occupancy rates, average room rate growth, discount rates and terminal rates, by comparing them to available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors. Where the assumptions applied are outside the expected range, we held discussions with the valuers to understand the effect of additional factors considered. We also discussed with the valuers how they have considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and market uncertainty in the valuations.\n\n## Our findings\n\nThe Group has a structured and comprehensive process in identifying hotel assets with impairment indicators. We found that  the  valuation  method used in the valuations was in in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions applied  were  comparable  to  currently  observable  market  data,  taking  into  consideration  the  uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Valuation of development properties\n\n(Refer to note 12 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant residential development properties held for sale in Singapore, China and the United Kingdom (UK). Development properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable values. The determination of the estimated net realisable value is highly dependent on the Group's expectations of future selling prices of unsold development properties.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook, government policies and market sentiments, which might exert downward pressure on property prices in countries where the Group holds development properties for sale. These factors could lead to future trends in these markets departing from known trends from past experience, thereby resulting in a significant impact on the future selling price estimates. Consequently, there is a risk that the carrying values of unsold development properties could exceed the actual selling prices, resulting in unforeseen losses when these properties are sold.\n\nIn estimating the future selling prices of unsold development properties, the Group has taken into account real estate price trend information, its sale strategy for the properties and selling prices estimated by external valuers when necessary.\n\nThe  valuation  reports  obtained  from  the  external  valuers  for  certain  properties  have  highlighted  that  as  a  result  of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to an the unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty, and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to their valuations than would normally be the case. Due to the uncertainty that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have also recommended to keep the valuations of these properties under frequent review.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe focused our work on development properties with low margins.\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of the Group's estimated future selling prices for its development projects, we considered recently transacted prices of units under development sold and prices of comparable properties located in the vicinity of these development projects, taking into account the prevailing market trends and the Group's selling plans for these properties. We made enquiries of the external valuers to understand the approach adopted in estimating the future selling prices of the development properties.\n\n## Our findings\n\nIn making its estimates of future selling prices, the Group takes into account market data including the macroeconomic factors and real estate price trends of the markets in which the properties are located, its sales strategy and the selling prices for certain development projects provided by the independent external valuers. The Group performs a regular review of its estimates of future selling prices of development projects and revises them when necessary.\n\nWe found the Group's estimated future selling prices, which are used in determining the net realisable values and the resultant allowance for foreseeable losses on its development projects, have taken into consideration currently available market data and prevailing market conditions.",

Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nWe have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nResponsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act, SFRS(I)s and IFRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\nAuditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditors'  report  that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\nI\n\nN\n\nD\n\nE\n\nP\n\nE\n\nN\n\nD\n\nE\n\nN\n\nT\n\nA\n\nU\n\nD\n\nI\n\nT\n\nO\n\nR\n\nS\n\n## ,   R E P\n\nO\n\nR\n\nT\n\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the  directors  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and  timing  of  the  audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  directors  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical  requirements  regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulations precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations  incorporated  in  Singapore  of  which  we  are  the  auditors  have  been  properly  kept  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Lo Mun Wai.\n\n## KPMG LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\n## Singapore\n\n7 April 2021",

Ltd., a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThe  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Singapore  Financial  Reporting  Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). SFRS(I)s, issued by the Accounting Standards Council (ASC), comprises standards and interpretations that are equivalents to IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). All references to SFRS(I)s and IFRSs are subsequently referred to as SFRS(I) in the financial statements. The changes to significant accounting policies are described in note 2.5.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise described in the notes below.\n\n## 2.3 Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Singapore  dollars,  which  is  the  Company's  functional  currency.  All financial information has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.",

This includes a team that regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments and reports to the Group Chief Financial Officer who has overall responsibility for all significant fair value measurements. If third party information, such as broker quotes or independent valuers' report, is used to measure fair values, then the team assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of SFRS(I), including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.\n\nSignificant valuation issues are reported to the Group's Audit Committee and Board of Directors.\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7\n- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u00b7 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable\n\ninputs).\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements (cont'd)\n\nIf the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).\n\nThe Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nFurther information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:\n\nNote 5\n\nInvestment properties\n\nNote 9\n\nAcquisition of joint venture\n\nNote 25\n\nShare-based payment arrangements\n\nNote 39\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n\nNote 41\n\nFinancial instruments\n\n## 2.5 Changes in accounting polices\n\n## New standards and amendments\n\nThe Group has applied the following amendments to and interpretations of SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in SFRS(I) Standards\n- \u00b7 Definition of Material (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) 1-8)\n\nIn addition to the above, the Group has early adopted the following amendments to standards which are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2020 with earlier application permitted:\n\n- \u00b7 COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to SFRS(I) 16)\n- \u00b7 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1)\n\nCOVID-19-Related Rent Concessions Amendment to SFRS(I) 16 was issued on 28 May 2020 and introduces an optional practical expedient for leases in which the Group is a lessee - i.e. for leases to which the Group applies the practical expedient, the Group is not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic are lease modifications. The Group has applied the amendment retrospectively. The amendment has no impact on accumulated profits at 1 January 2020.\n\nUnder  existing  SFRS(I)  1-1  requirements,  the  Group  classifies  a  liability  as  current  when  they  do  not  have  an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the reporting period. As part of its amendments, Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 has removed the requirement for a right to be unconditional and instead, requires that a right to defer settlement to have substance and exist at the end of the reporting period. With these amendments, it is now clarified that a right to defer exists only if the Group complies with conditions specified in the loan agreement at the end of the reporting period, even if the lender does not test compliance until a later date. The Group classifies a liability as non-current if it has a right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nThe application of these amendments to standards and interpretations did not have a material effect on the financial statements.",

In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\n\nThe Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\n## Acquisitions from 1 January 2017\n\nFor acquisitions from 1 January 2017, the Group measures goodwill at the date of acquisition as:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n- \u00b7 the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests (NCI) in the acquiree; plus\n- \u00b7 if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree,\n\nover  the  net  recognised  amount  (generally  fair  value)  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.\n\nWhen the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe  consideration  transferred  does  not  include  amounts  related  to  the  settlement  of  pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are exchanged for awards held by the acquiree's employees (acquiree's awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This  determination  is  based  on  the  market-based  value  of  the  replacement  awards  compared  with  the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Business combinations (cont'd)\n\nFor non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation, the Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure them at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the  recognised  amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. All other noncontrolling interests are measured at acquisition-date fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another standard.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity investments, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nChanges in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the adjustment to noncontrolling interests and the fair value of consideration paid is recognised directly in equity and presented as part of equity attributable to owners of the Company.\n\n## Acquisitions before 1 January 2017\n\nAs part of transition to SFRS(I), the Group elected not to restate those business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to SFRS(I), i.e. 1 January 2017. Goodwill arising from acquisitions before 1 January 2017 has been carried forward from the previous FRS framework as at the date of transition.\n\n## (ii) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.\n\n## (iii) Loss of control\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\n## (iv) Investments in associates and joint ventures (equity-accounted investees)\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over their financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.",

They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\nWhen the Group's share of  losses  exceeds  its  investment  in  an  equity-accounted  investee,  the  carrying amount of  that  interest,  together  with  any  long-term  interests  that,  in  substance,  form  part  thereof,  is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\n## (v) Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control whereby the Group has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to an arrangement. The Group accounts for each of its assets, liabilities and transactions, including its share of those held or incurred jointly, in relation to the joint operation.\n\nThe Group is a 51% (2019: 51%) partner in Hong Realty (Private) Limited - Pasir Ris Joint Venture (the Pasir Ris Joint Venture), a joint arrangement formed with two fellow subsidiaries, whose principal activity is that of a property developer and the place of business is in Singapore. The Group is also a 20% (2019: 20%) partner in Park Court Aoyama The Tower, a joint arrangement formed with a third party, whose principal activity is that of a property developer and the place of business is in Japan. The Group has classified both joint arrangements as joint operations as the joint venture partners control the joint arrangements collectively and the joint arrangements are not structured through separate legal vehicles.\n\n## (vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investee are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## (vii) Subsidiaries and joint ventures in the separate financial statements\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated in the Company's statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## 3.2 Foreign currencies\n\n## (i) Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.2 Foreign currencies (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Foreign currency transactions (cont'd)\n\nNon-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  that  are  measured  at  fair  value are  translated  to  the  functional  currencies  at  the  exchange  rates  at  the  dates  that  the  fair  values  were determined. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss. However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in OCI:\n\n- \u00b7 differences arising on the translation of monetary items that in substance form part of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation;\n- \u00b7 an  investment  in  equity  securities  designated  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income (FVOCI);\n- \u00b7 a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; or\n- \u00b7 qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition,  are  translated  to  Singapore  dollars  at  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  reporting  date.  The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign  currency  differences  are  recognised  in  OCI.  However,  if  the  foreign  operation  is  a  non  whollyowned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the Group's net investment in the foreign operation are recognised in OCI, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.\n\n## 3.3 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.",

The  carrying  amount of the replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.\n\nDepreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.\n\nDepreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.\n\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land (including 999-year leasehold land). For freehold and leasehold properties under development and renovation-in-progress, no depreciation is provided until these items have been completed.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.3 Property, plant and equipment (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Depreciation (cont'd)\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:\n\nFreehold and leasehold land and buildings\n\n- \u2022 Core component of hotel buildings\n- -  50 years, or lease term if shorter\n- \u2022 Surface, finishes and services of hotel buildings\n- -  30 years, or lease term if shorter\n- \u2022 Leasehold land\n- -  Lease term\n\nFurniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements\n\n- -  3 to 20 years\n\nResidual values ascribed to the core component of hotel buildings depend on the nature, location and tenure of each hotel property. No residual values are ascribed to surface, finishes and services of hotel buildings and right-of-use assets in respect of leases where the Group is a lessee.\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date.\n\n## 3.4 Investment properties\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nInvestment properties are properties held either to earn rental income or capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes.\n\nInvestment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment properties.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nAt  commencement or  on  modification  of  a  contract  that  contains  a  lease  component,  the  Group  allocates  the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case, the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments  that  are  not  paid  at  the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe Group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; and\n- \u00b7 the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  It  is  remeasured  when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised insubstance fixed lease payment.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.5 Leases (cont'd)\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## COVID-19-related rent concessions\n\nThe Group has early adopted COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions - Amendment to SFRS(I) 16. The Group applies the practical expedient allowing it not to assess whether eligible rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are lease modifications. The Group applies the practical expedient consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. For rent concessions in leases to which the Group chooses not to apply the practical expedient, or that do not qualify for the practical expedient, the Group assesses whether there is a lease modification.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nAt inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nTo classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n\nIf  an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\nThe Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in SFRS(I) 9 to the net investment in the lease (see note 3.11(i)). The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.\n\nThe Group recognises lease payments received from investment property under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'revenue'.",

All other financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially  recognised  when  the  Group  becomes  a  party  to  the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following  conditions  and  is  not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Debt investments at FVOCI\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Equity investments at FVOCI\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investmentby-investment basis.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n- (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)\n\nNon-derivative financial assets (cont'd)\n\n## Financial assets at FVTPL\n\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the  requirements  to  be  measured  at  amortised  cost  or  at  FVOCI  or  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\n## Financial assets: Business model assessment\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These  include  whether  management's  strategy  focuses  on  earning  contractual  interest  income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;\n- \u00b7 how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;\n- \u00b7 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;\n- \u00b7 how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n- \u00b7 the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.\n\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.\n\nFinancial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\n\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.",

This  includes  assessing  whether  the  financial  asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;\n- \u00b7 terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;\n- \u00b7 prepayment and extension features; and\n- \u00b7 terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).\n\nA  prepayment  feature  is  consistent  with  the  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  criterion  if  the prepayment  amount  substantially  represents  unpaid  amounts  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses\n\n## Financial assets at FVTPL\n\nThese  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Net  gains  and  losses,  including  any  interest  or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThese  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Debt investments at FVOCI\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Equity investments at FVOCI\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n- (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)\n\n## Non-derivative financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nOther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nTransferred  assets  are  not  derecognised  when  the  Group  enters  into  transactions  whereby  it  transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or when they expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iv) Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (v) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, pledged deposits, deposits charged and restricted cash are excluded whilst bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents.",

Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.\n\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value and any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the  risk  management objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedge.  The  Group  also  documents  the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\n## Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform\n\nFor the purpose of evaluating whether there is an economic relationship between the hedged item(s) and the hedging instrument(s), the Group assumes that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFor a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the Group assumes that the benchmark interest rate will not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform for the purpose of assessing whether the forecast transaction is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss. In determining whether a previously designated forecast transaction in a discontinued cash flow hedge is still expected to occur, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark cash flows designated as a hedge will not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe Group will cease to apply the specific policy for assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (i) to a hedged item or hedging instrument when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the respective item or instrument or (ii) when the hedging relationship is discontinued. For its highly probable assessment of the hedged item, the Group will no longer apply the specific policy when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform about the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based future cash flows of the hedged item is no longer present, or when the hedging relationship is discontinued.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  as  hedging  instruments  to  hedge  the  variability  in  cash  flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item,  determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n## (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)\n\n## Cash flow hedges (cont'd)\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve remains in equity until it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe  Group  designates  certain  derivatives  and  non-derivative  financial  liabilities  as  hedges  of  foreign exchange risk on a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nWhen a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation, respectively.\n\n## (vii) Share capital\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary  shares  are  classified  as  equity.  Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  issue  of  ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe Group's non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares are classified as equity, because they bear discretionary dividends, do not contain any obligations to deliver cash or other financial assets and do not require settlement in a variable number of the Group's equity instruments. Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity.\n\n## 3.7 Development properties\n\nDevelopment properties  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.  Cost  includes  acquisition costs, development expenditure, capitalised borrowing costs (applicable to construction of a development for which revenue is to be recognised at a point in time) and other costs directly attributable to the development activities.\n\nNet  realisable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less  estimated  costs  of completion and selling expenses. The write-down to net realisable value is presented as allowance for foreseeable losses.",

Otherwise, such costs are recognised as an expense immediately.\n\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently amortised on a systematic basis as the Group recognises the related revenue on the contract. An impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of capitalised contract costs exceeds the expected remaining consideration less any directly related costs not yet recognised as expenses.\n\n## 3.9 Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets primarily relate to the Group's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on construction of development properties. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group invoices the customer.\n\nContract liabilities primarily relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 advance consideration received from customers; and\n- \u00b7 progress billings issued in excess of the Group's rights to the consideration.\n\n## 3.10 Consumable stocks\n\nConsumable stocks comprise principally food and beverage and other hotel related consumable supplies. Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the stocks, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and cost necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 3.11 Impairment\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets\n\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 debt investments measured at FVOCI;\n- \u00b7 contract assets (as defined in SFRS(I) 15 ) and\n- \u00b7 lease receivables.\n\nLoss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or\n- \u00b7 Lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument or contract asset.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.11 Impairment (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets (cont'd)\n\n## Simplified approach\n\nThe  Group  applies  the  simplified  approach  to  provide  for  ECL  for  all  trade  receivables  (including  lease receivables) and contract assets. The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\n## General approach\n\nThe Group applies the general approach to provide for ECL on all other financial instruments. Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at initial recognition.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen  determining  whether  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  has  increased  significantly  since  initial recognition  and  when  estimating  ECL,  the  Group  considers  reasonable  and  supportable  information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.\n\nIf credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\n## Measurement of ECLs\n\nECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default;\n- \u00b7 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.",

This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## (ii) Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of an associate or joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with the requirements for non-financial assets. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n## (iii) Non-financial assets\n\nThe  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group's  non-financial  assets,  other  than  development  properties,  contract costs, contract assets, consumable stocks and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets' recoverable amounts are estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date,  and  as  and  when  indicators  of  impairment  are  identified.  An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  if  the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of  disposal.  In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.11 Impairment (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Non-financial assets (cont'd)\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised  in  prior  periods  are  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  for  any  indications  that  the  loss  has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nGoodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate or a joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.\n\n## 3.12 Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are highly probable to be recovered primarily  through  sale  rather  than  through  continuing  use,  are  classified  as  held  for  sale.  Immediately  before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter, the assets, or disposal group, classified as held for sale are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.\n\nAny impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to financial assets and deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale are not depreciated.\n\n## 3.13 Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group recognises remeasurement gains or losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.",

Net  interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Other long-term service benefits\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than defined contribution and defined benefit plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in  current  and  prior  periods.  The  obligation  is  calculated  using  the  projected  unit  credit  method  and  is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.\n\n## (iv) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (v) Share-based payment transactions\n\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as  an  employee  expense,  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  equity,  over  the  period  that  the  employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment  awards  with  non-vesting  conditions,  the  grant  date  fair  value  of  the  share-based  payment  is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\nShare-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its  equity  instruments  of  the  Group  entities  are  accounted  for  as  equity-settled  share-based  payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group.\n\nWhere the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees as measured at the date of modification.\n\nWhere an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where nonvesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.14 Provisions\n\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.\n\n## Levies\n\nA provision for levies is recognised when the condition that triggers the payment of the levy as specified in the relevant legislation is met. If a levy obligation is subject to a minimum activity threshold so that the obligating event is reaching a minimum activity, then a provision is recognised when that minimum activity threshold is reached.\n\n## 3.15 Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial  guarantees  are  financial  instruments  issued  by  the  Group  that  require  the  issuer  to  make  specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to meet payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantees contracts are accounted for as insurance contracts. A provision is recognised based on the Group's estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the reporting date. The provision is assessed by reviewing individual claims and tested for adequacy by comparing the amount recognised and the amount that would be required to settle the guarantee contract.\n\n## 3.16 Revenue recognition\n\n## (i) Development properties for sale\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential and mixed development projects to customers through fixed-price contracts. Revenue is recognised when the control over a development property has been transferred to the customer. At contract inception, the Group assesses whether the Group transfers control of the residential project over time or at a point in time by determining if (a) its performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group; and (b) the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nWhere a development property has no alternative use for the Group due to contractual restriction, and the Group has enforceable rights to payment for performance completed to date arising from the contractual terms,  revenue  is  recognised  over  time  by  reference  to  the  Group's  progress  towards  completing  the construction of the development property. The measure of progress is determined based on the stage of completion of construction certified by quantity surveyors. Costs incurred that are not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a performance obligation are excluded from the measure of progress and instead are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn respect of contracts where the Group does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognised only when the completed property is delivered to the customer and the customer has accepted it in accordance with the sales contract.",

In adjusting for the financing component,  the  Group  uses  a  discount  rate  that  would  reflect  that  of  a  separate  financing  transaction between the Group and its customer at contract inception. A finance income or finance expense will be recognised depending on the arrangement. The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for the existence of significant financing component when the period between the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer and the payment date is 12 months or less.\n\nRevenue  is  measured  at  the  transaction  price  agreed  under  the  contract  entered  into  with  customers. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.\n\nThe customer is invoiced based on a payment schedule which is typically triggered upon achievement of specified construction milestones. If the value of the goods transferred by the Group exceeds the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the value of the goods transferred, a contract liability is recognised. The accounting policy for contract assets and contract liabilities is set out in note 3.9.\n\n## (ii) Rental income\n\nRental  income  (net  of  any  lease  incentives)  is  recognised  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease  term. Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental, are recognised as income in the accounting period in which it is earned and the amount can be reliably measured.\n\n## (iii) Hotel income\n\nRevenue from hotel operations is recognised at the point when the accommodation and related services are rendered.\n\n## (iv) Management services, consultancy services and laundry services\n\nManagement and consultancy fees and laundry services are recognised at the point when such services are rendered.\n\n## (v) Dividends\n\nDividend income is recognised in profit or loss when the shareholder's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.17 Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are initially recognised as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the conditions for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised. In this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.\n\n## 3.18 Finance income and costs\n\nThe Group's finance income and costs include:\n\n- \u00b7 interest income on amounts owing by fellow subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, debt investment and funds invested;\n- \u00b7 interest expense on borrowings, financial derivatives and lease liabilities;\n- \u00b7 the fair value gains or losses on financial derivatives;\n- \u00b7 the net gains or losses on financial assets at FVTPL;\n- \u00b7 the foreign currency gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities;\n- \u00b7 hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 unwinding of discount on non-current liabilities.\n\nInterest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\nThe 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:\n\n- \u00b7 the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or\n- \u00b7 the amortised cost of the financial liability.\n\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.",

Tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do  not  meet  the  definition  of  income  taxes,  and  therefore  accounted  for  them  under  SFRS(I)  1-37  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised for:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nThe measurement of deferred taxes reflects the consequences that follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.19 Tax (cont'd)\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.\n\nIn  determining  the  amount  of  current  and  deferred  tax,  the  Group  takes  into  account  the  impact  of  uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n\n## 3.20 Earnings per share\n\nThe Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the dilutive effect arising from the conversion of the non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares.\n\n## 3.21 Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the Group's Board of Directors and Group CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## 3.22 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2020 and earlier application is permitted. Except as disclosed in note 2.5, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements.\n\nThe Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the new standards and amendments to standards on its financial statements.",

Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken by the Group. The cash generating units (CGU) are individual hotels.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the individual hotels, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach and were estimated using the discounted cash flow method. Under this methodology, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about the third party efficient operator's future cash flows, discounted to their present value. It involves each hotel's future cash flows, taking into consideration the assumptions in respect of revenue growth (principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth) and major expense items for each hotel. The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area, as well as the internal business plan for the hotel in the relevant market. These plans and forecasts include management's most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group sought guidance on the fair values of the hotels from independent external valuers with appropriate professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued. In relying on the valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation method and estimates are reflective of current market conditions. The valuation reports obtained from external valuers of certain hotels have highlighted that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to their valuations than would normally be the case. Due to the unknown future impact that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have recommended to keep the valuations of these properties under frequent review.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  recognised  a  net  impairment  loss  of  $87,517,000  on  its  hotel  properties,  comprising impairment losses of $111,330,000 on eight hotels in United States of America (US), four hotels in Europe, and two hotels in Asia, net of impairment losses reversed of $23,813,000 in respect of two hotels in US, five hotels in Europe, and a hotel in Asia. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were recognised during the year were $1,041,634,000 as at 31 December 2020. The impairment losses were a result of the challenging operating performance of these hotels and the subdued outlook for these hotels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties since the last external valuations performed. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the hotel properties on which impairment losses were reversed during the year were $365,413,000 as at 31 December 2020.\n\nIn 2019, an impairment loss of $58,236,000 was recognised on one hotel in the US, one hotel in Europe and two hotels in Asia, all of which are held by certain subsidiaries of M&C. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the said impaired properties were $593,093,000 as at 31 December 2019. The impairment losses were a result of the challenging hospitality market in these regions, affecting the operating performance of these hotels. In particular, the room rates achieved by these hotels were lower than expected.\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.\n\nImpairment losses recognised or reversed were included in 'other operating expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the hotel operations segment.",

An increase in occupancy rate and/or average room rate growth in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in discount rate or terminal rate in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 5 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\n|                                                | Note   | Group $'000      | Company $'000   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                                           |        |                  |                 |\n| At 1 January 2019                              |        | 4,797,841        | 600,812         |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries                    | 39     | 446,772          | -               |\n| Additions                                      |        | 136,079          | 1,127           |\n| Disposal/Written off                           |        | (1,944)          | (1,517)         |\n| Transfers from development properties          |        | 136,683          | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation       |        | 2,681            | -               |\n| At 31 December 2019                            |        | 5,518,112        | 600,422         |\n| At 1 January 2020                              |        | 5,518,112        | 600,422         |\n| Loss of control in subsidiaries                |        | (64,926)         | -               |\n| Additions                                      |        | 194,854 (21,692) | 3,226           |\n| Disposal/Written off                           |        | 57,000           | -               |\n| Transfers from development properties          |        |                  | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation       |        | 77,610           | -               |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses |        |                  |                 |\n| At 1 January 2019                              |        | 1,012,653        | 148,595         |\n| Charge for the year                            |        | 96,711           | 15,317          |\n| Reversal of impairment loss                    |        | (2,414)          | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation       |        | 901              | -               |\n| At 31 December 2019                            |        | 1,107,851        | 163,912         |\n| At 1 January 2020                              |        | 1,107,851        | 163,912         |\n| Charge for the year                            |        | 107,541          | 14,781          |\n| Loss of control in subsidiaries                |        | (15,160)         | -               |\n| Disposal/Written off                           |        | (21,596)         | -               |\n| Impairment loss                                |        | 12,035           | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation       |        | 1,590            | -               |\n| At 31 December 2020                            |        | 1,192,261        | 178,693         |\n| Carrying amounts                               |        |                  |                 |\n| At 1 January 2019                              |        | 3,785,188        | 452,217         |\n| At 31 December 2019                            |        | 4,410,261        | 436,510         |\n| At 31 December 2020                            |        | 4,568,697        | 424,955         |\n| Fair value                                     |        |                  |                 |\n| At 1 January 2019                              |        | 7,919,056        | 1,122,087       |\n| At 31 December 2019                            |        | 8,780,086        | 1,115,949       |\n| At 31 December 2020                            |        | 8,901,489        | 1,114,435       |",

Generally, each of the leases is fixed for a period of 1 to 29 years (2019: 1 to 29 years), and subsequent renewals are negotiated at prevailing market rates and terms.\n\nDuring the year, the Group's transfers from development properties to investment properties relate to two office buildings in Shanghai which were completed and commenced leasing activities during the year. In 2019, the Group's transfers from development properties to investment properties related to several office buildings in Shanghai which were completed and commenced leasing activities in that year.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, investment properties of the Group with a total carrying amount of $1,464,268,000 (2019: $1,382,003,000) were mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to notes 22 and 23 for more details of the facilities).\n\nThe management undertook their annual review of the carrying amounts of investment properties for indicators of impairment. Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the investment properties, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and valuein-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach, and were estimated using discounted cash flow, direct comparison and income capitalisation methods.\n\nBased on the impairment assessment undertaken in 2020, the Group recognised impairment loss of $12,035,000 on one hotel in the Maldives and one hotel in Italy, both of which are held by the Group's non wholly-owned subsidiary, CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT). The impairment loss was a result of the challenging operating performance of these hotels and the subdued outlook for these hotels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impairment loss was recognised in 'other operating expenses' and the investment properties segment. In 2019, the Group reversed impairment loss of $2,414,000 on one hotel in Germany and one hotel in the Maldives, both of which were held by CDLHT. The reversal of impairment loss was recognised in 'other operating expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the investment properties segment.\n\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts are set out below:\n\n|                          | Maldives       | Italy          |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Occupancy rate           |                |                |\n| 2020                     | 28.0% to 67.0% | 50.0% to 82.0% |\n| 2019                     | -              | -              |\n| Average room rate growth |                |                |\n| 2020                     | 3.7%           | 2.3%           |\n| 2019                     | -              | -              |\n| Discount rate            |                |                |\n| 2020                     | 12.0%          | 6.8%           |\n| 2019                     | -              | -              |\n| Terminal rates           |                |                |\n| 2020                     | 9.0%           | 4.9%           |\n| 2019                     | -              | -              |\n\nThe forecasts cover a five to ten years period, and cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate ranging between 1.8% and 3.0% (2019: Nil), which is based upon the expected trading growth for each hotel and inflation in the country in which the hotel is located.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 5 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONT'D)\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. An increase in occupancy rate and/or average room rate growth in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in discount rate or terminal rate in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value disclosure for the investment properties for the Group and the Company of $8,901,489,000 (2019: $8,780,086,000) and $1,114,435,000 (2019: $1,115,949,000) respectively has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe discounted cash flow method involves the estimation and projection of an income stream over a period and discounting the income stream with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value. The direct comparison method involves an analysis of comparable sales of similar properties and adjusting the transacted prices to those reflective of the investment properties of the Group. The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates.\n\nFor a majority of investment properties located in Singapore, the fair values are based on in-house valuations conducted by a licensed appraiser who is also an officer of the Company. The licensed appraiser has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and has experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. The fair values of investment properties located overseas and other investment properties in Singapore are determined by independent licensed appraisers who have appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued.\n\nIn relying on the valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation methods and estimates are reflective of current market conditions. The valuation reports obtained from external valuers of certain hotels have highlighted that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to their valuations than would normally be the case. Due to the unknown future impact that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have recommended to keep the valuations of these properties under frequent review.",

Based on the assessment, the Company recognised an impairment loss of $1,727,000 (2019: $Nil) on its investment in a wholly-owned subsidiary. The recoverable amount of the subsidiary was estimated taking into consideration the fair values of the underlying assets and the liabilities of the company. The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe non-trade amounts owing by and to subsidiaries are unsecured. In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, interest was charged at rates ranging from 0.32% to 3.95% (2019: 0.20% to 4.35%) per annum and at rates ranging from 2.74% to 3.00% (2019: 2.58% to 3.25%) per annum respectively. The non-trade balances with  subsidiaries  that  are  presented  as  receivable  or  repayable  within  one  year  are  receivable  or  repayable  on demand.\n\nThe  non-trade  amounts  owing  by  subsidiaries  receivable  after  one  year  are  loans  to  subsidiaries  for  which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. These amounts are, in substance, a part of the Company's net investments in subsidiaries.",

Impairment losses recognised were included on the face of consolidated statement of profit or loss. Details are set out under 'Material joint venture' below.\n\nIncluded in the amounts owing to joint ventures is an amount of $264.3 million owing to HCP Group.\n\n## Material joint venture\n\nThe Group's material joint venture relates to HCP. HCP is an unlisted joint venture in which the Group has joint control via an investor rights agreement and a 63.75% ownership interest. HCP, which is incorporated in Cayman Islands,  is  an  investment  holding  company  that  holds  an  indirect  80.01%  equity  interest  in  Chongqing  Sincere Yuanchuang Industrial Co., Ltd ('Sincere Property Group'), a real estate developer in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Approximately 13.1% and 48.9% of the shares held by HCP Group in Sincere Property Group are pledged to the Group and other parties, respectively.\n\nThis investment offers the Group the opportunity to partner with Sincere Property Group and to acquire a meaningful stake in platform which will allow a sizeable expansion of the Group's footprint in the PRC.\n\nThe Group has a call option to acquire an additional 11.25% equity interest in HCP, which is exercisable at the Group's discretion within a 6-month period commencing on 1 July 2022 for a consideration of approximately $157.3 million (RMB774.1 million). As at 31 December 2020, the fair value of this call option is nil.\n\nHCP is structured as a separate vehicle and the Group has residual interest in its net assets. Accordingly, the Group has classified its interest in HCP as a joint venture, which is equity accounted.",

The Group accounted for the acquisition of HCP as a business combination, which requires the purchase price to be allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent liabilities (purchase price allocation or 'PPA').\n\nThe  fair  values  of  assets  and  liabilities,  which  involve  significant  judgement  and  estimates,  have  been determined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair values of the underlying properties held by HCP Group were determined based on external independent valuations undertaken.\n- A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to HCP Group's underlying property portfolio comprising  development  properties,  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  investment  properties, based on the valuation amounts in the independent valuation reports. The valuation of development properties is critically dependent upon the estimated future selling prices. The valuation of property, plant and equipment and investment properties involves significant judgement in determining both the valuation methods to be used and the key assumptions to be applied. The valuations are sensitive to the key assumptions applied and a change in assumptions may have a significant impact on the valuations.\n- \u00b7 The fair values of the amounts due from related parties of HCP Group were estimated, taking into consideration the repayment patterns and the settlement arrangements agreed between the HCP Group and its related parties.\n- \u00b7 The fair values of contingent liabilities relating to financial guarantees issued by HCP Group for credit facilities granted to the related parties of HCP Group involve making estimates of the guarantees being invoked.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of a put option granted by HCP Group to a non-controlling shareholder of Sincere Property Group (the 'Put Option') for the latter to sell its 19.99% of shares in Sincere Property Group was estimated based on the present value of the exercise price of the put option.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of indemnities provided by the joint venture partner and its related parties in relation to the liabilities associated with the Put Option and contingent liabilities arising from the guarantees issued by Sincere Property Group to the joint venture partner and its related parties, was estimated to be nil, having considered the Group's ability to recover these indemnity assets.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 9 INVESTMENTS IN AND BALANCES WITH JOINT VENTURES (CONT'D)\n\nInvestment in and balances with HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n- (a) Accounting for acquisition of HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n## Measurement of fair values\n\nThe valuation techniques used for measuring the fair values of the underlying significant assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n## Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Valuation technique\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and investment properties\n\nDirect comparison, discounted cash flow, income capitalisation,  cost  and  residual  methods:  The  direct comparison  method  involved  the  analysis  of  comparable sales  of  similar  assets  and  adjusting  the  sale  prices  to that  reflective  of  the  properties.  The  discounted  cash  flow method  involved  forecasting  the  properties'  income  stream and  discounting  the  income  stream  at  the  market  rate  of interest  at  the  acquisition  date.  The  income  capitalisation method  capitalises  an  income  stream  into  a  present  value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates. The cost method considers the current replacement cost of creating a comparable property. The residual method involves deducting the estimated cost to complete as of valuation date and other relevant costs from gross development value of the proposed development assuming satisfactory completion and accounting for developer profit.\n\nDevelopment properties\n\nDirect comparison, income capitalisation, cost and residual methods: The direct comparison method involves the analysis of  comparable  sales  of  similar  assets  and  adjusting  the sale  prices  to  that  reflective  of  the  properties.

The valuation reports obtained from external valuer of the properties have highlighted that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to the valuations than would normally be the case. Due to the uncertainty that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuer has recommended to keep the valuations of these properties under frequent review.\n\nThe fair value measurements were categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe PPA exercise indicated that the Group's cost of investment in HCP of $0.9 billion represents goodwill. Impairment of the Group's investment in HCP is set out below.\n\n## (b) Impairment of the equity investment in HCP Group\n\nSubsequent to the acquisition, the Group identified indicators of impairment on its equity investment in HCP Group arising from the challenging macro-economic environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit tightening measures imposed on China's real estate sector and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group. The Group assessed the recoverable amount of the investment using the fair value less costs to sell approach which is based on the financial position of the HCP Group, which took into consideration the fair values of the joint venture's underlying assets and liabilities. Based on the assessment undertaken, the recoverable amount was estimated to be nil. Accordingly, an impairment loss of $806.4 million was recognised, after taking into account the Group's share of HCP Group's loss of $75.8 million recognised. The impairment loss is included as part of 'Share of after-tax (loss)/profit of joint ventures' in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  or  loss,  and  in  the  property  development  ($435.4  million),  hotel operations ($48.4 million) and investment properties ($322.6 million) segments.\n\nAs the Group's cost of investment in HCP Cayman has been reduced to nil, the Group has discontinued equity accounting for further losses of HCP Group as the Group has no obligation to fund HCP Group's operations or make payments on behalf of HCP Group (other than the financial guarantee that the Group has issued in relation to a loan undertaken by HCP Group for which a provision has been made for the full guarantee amount (refer to 'Financial guarantee issued' below).\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation technique used.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 9 INVESTMENTS IN AND BALANCES WITH JOINT VENTURES (CONT'D)\n\nInvestment in and balances with HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n## (b) Impairment of the equity investment in HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n| Valuation technique                                                                                                                                               | Significant  unobservable  inputs   | Inter-relationship between key  unobservable  inputs  and  fair  value measurement         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The fair value is calculated using the net asset value  (NAV) of the investee entity adjusted for the fair value  of the underlying properties, where applicable. | NAV                                 | The  estimated  fair  value  would  increase/(decrease)  if  the  NAV  was higher/(lower). |\n\n## (c) Impairment of amounts owing by HCP Group\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $683.6 million (2019: $Nil) and amounts owing to HCP Group of $264.3 million (2019: $Nil). The Group undertook an impairment assessment of the amounts owing from HCP Group. The Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group were credit-impaired, having considered past repayment trends, the debt maturity profile of Sincere Property Group, the default risk on the amounts owing by Sincere Property Group and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group determined the lifetime expected credit losses ('ECL') to be recognised based on the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due from the HCP Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive), discounted at the effective interest rate of the amounts owing by HCP Group. The ECL takes into account the adjusted financial position of Sincere Property Group (taking into account the estimated recoverable amounts of the properties held by Sincere Property Group and its associates and joint ventures, and potential additional costs to be incurred on borrowings of Sincere Property Group), the debt profile of Sincere Property Group, the value of collateral that the Group holds and certain amounts owing by the Group to HCP Group.\n\nThe key parameters applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a discount of up to 50% on the properties held by Sincere Property Group and the carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures and additional costs including potential penalty interest of approximately 30% on borrowings. The discount assumptions used to estimate the difference between the fair value of the underlying properties and the expected sales price under a forced sale scenario are based on market data available. The Group also considered the value of the collateral held, which relates to shares in a property-owing entity which has been pledged by HCP Group to the Group, based on the recently transacted price of the shares.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $323.9 million on the amounts owing by HCP Group. At the reporting date, the Group had amounts owing by HCP Group of $359.7 million (net of impairment loss recognised) (2019: $Nil) and amounts owing to HCP Group of $264.3 million (2019: $15.0 million).\n\nChanges to  circumstances  and  estimates  may  impact  the  amount  of  expected  credit  losses  recognised on  the  amounts  owing  by  HCP  Group.  The  expected  credit  losses  on  the  amounts  owing  by  HCP  Group can be sensitive to the assumptions used. An increase in the discount adjustment on the properties held by the Group and the carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures and additional costs including potential penalty interest on borrowings in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount. A lower discount adjustment on the properties held by HCP Group and the carrying values of investments in associate and joint ventures and lower additional costs including potential penalty interest on borrowings in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.",

Furthermore, weak market conditions have derailed the intended divestment plan for some of HCP Group's properties to reduce its debt, exacerbating the liquidity challenges that it faces. Subsequent to 31 December 2020, the credit ratings of certain of HCP Group's bonds were downgraded and the HCP Group did not repay the principal amounts of certain bonds on their maturities. Arising from these key events and the evolving developments within the HCP up to the date of the Group's issuance of these financial statements, the basis of accounting for HCP Group's key assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2020 would have to be re-assessed. Accordingly, management considers that the financial information of HCP Group as at 31 December 2020 would not faithfully represent HCP Group's financial position and would not be relevant to users of these financial statements. The Group does not have financial information of HCP Group that has been updated for events and circumstances described above.\n\nThe main business activities of HCP Group relate to the real estate business derived primarily from Sincere Property  Group,  which  is  an  issuer  of  several  domestic  corporate  bonds  listed  on  the  Shanghai  Stock Exchange. As long as the  listed  bonds  of  Sincere  Property  Group  remain  outstanding,  Sincere  Property Group is required to abide by the regulations of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Under the regulations of CSRC, any material information in relation to Sincere Property Group needs to be announced by Sincere Property Group in China no later than the announcement of the same elsewhere in the world, failing which Sincere Property Group and its controlling equity holder(s) could be liable under PRC laws. Sincere Property Group, which is required to announce its annual financial statements within 4 months from each financial year end is expected to announce its financial results for year ended 31 December 2020 in late April 2021. Accordingly, before Sincere Property Group announces its 2020 financial information in China, the Group is unable to disclose any financial information of HCP Group.\n\nAs a result of the above and the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the matters highlighted, the summarised financial information of HCP Group as at 31 December 2020 and the Group's unrecognised share of losses, commitments and contingent liabilities in relation to the HCP Group have not been presented in these financial statements.\n\nThe  evolving  developments  within  the  HCP  Group  may  result  in  additional  liabilities  (whether  actual  or contingent). The Group has ring-fenced its financial exposure to its investment in HCP and the Group has no obligation to fund HCP Group's operations or make payments on behalf of HCP Group, except as described in 'Financial guarantee issued' below.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 9 INVESTMENTS IN AND BALANCES WITH JOINT VENTURES (CONT'D)\n\n## Investment in and balances with HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n## (e) Financial guarantee issued\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has issued a financial guarantee of approximately $283.0 million (2019: $Nil) to a financial institution in connection to loan taken by the HCP Group. In addition, the Group has pledged an investment property with a carrying value of $359.8 million as at 31 December 2020 (2019: $Nil) under a second mortgage to the bank.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group has considered that the probability that the financial guarantee will be invoked and recognised a provision for the full amount of the guarantee (see note 28), taking into consideration the available financial information of HCP Group, Sincere Property Group not repaying the principal amounts of certain bonds on their maturities post 31 December 2020, the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group and legal advice received.\n\nSubsequent  to  the  reporting  date,  an  event  of  default  has  been  triggered  under  the  terms  of  the  loan agreement. At the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Group is in discussion with the lender on the financial guarantee issued.\n\n## Immaterial joint ventures\n\nThe Group has interests in a number of individually immaterial joint ventures. The following table summarises, in aggregate, the share of profit and other comprehensive income of these immaterial joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method:\n\n|                                                                        | Group      | Group      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                        | 2020 $'000 | 2019 $'000 |\n| Carrying amount of interests in individually immaterial joint ventures | 1,085,288  | 1,192,456  |\n| Group's share of:                                                      |            |            |\n| -  (loss)/profit from continuing operations/total comprehensive income | (1,611)    | 97,768     |\n\nThe Group's share of the joint ventures' commitments and contingent liabilities (excluding HCP) is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                      | Group 2019   | Group 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                      | 2020 $'000   | $'000        |\n| Commitments                                                                          |              |              |\n| Development expenditure contracted but not provided for in the financial  statements |              |              |\n|                                                                                      | 325,766      | 277,385      |\n| Capital expenditure contracted but not provided for in the financial statements      | 42,884       | 47,822       |\n| Non-cancellable operating lease receivable                                           | 84,422       | 90,121       |",

Ltd. (Summervale) for Nouvel 18, a 156-unit luxury freehold residential development on Anderson Road, Singapore. In October 2016, the Group established its third Profit Participation Securities (PPS) by entering into an investment agreement, and an asset management and marketing agreement with an unrelated party, Green 18 Pte. Ltd. (Green 18), to exit its entire interest in Summervale. As part of the investment agreement, the Group subscribed for a note of $140 million issued by Summervale. According to the asset management and marketing agreement, Summervale appointed Trentwell Management Pte. Ltd. (Trentwell), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, as the asset manager and marketing agent of Summervale to manage and lease out Nouvel 18, as well as to market and divest units in Nouvel 18 for a period of five years (with an option to extend to seven years).\n- ii) $34,390,000 (2019: $31,919,000) relating to the Group's investment in property-linked notes issued for the development of a luxury retirement village in New South Wales.\n- iii) $10,724,000 (2019: $9,675,000) relating to a convertible loan granted to a joint venture.\n- iv) $540,550,000 as at 31 December 2019 relating to a loan granted to Sincere Property Group, a real estate developer in China. The loan was repaid during 2020 following the Group's acquisition of a 63.75% equity interest in HCP.\n- (c) Unquoted debt investment at amortised cost with gross carrying amount of $305,394,000 (US$230 million) (2019: $311,604,000 (US$230 million)) relates to the Group's investment in a US$ bond issued by Sincere Property Group. The bond bears interest at 10% (2019: 10%) per annum and matures within 2 (2019: 3) years. An impairment loss of $288,000,000 (2019: $Nil) was recognised on the bond. The Group has no collateral in respect of this investment.\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment for debt investments at amortised cost during the year was as follows:\n\n|                            | Lifetime ECL   credit -impaired $'000   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Balance as at 1 January    | -                                       |\n| Impairment loss recognised | 288,000                                 |\n| Balance as at 31 December  | 288,000                                 |\n\nThe impairment loss recognised was included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Group undertook an impairment assessment of the investment in the bond. The Group assessed that the investment in the bond was credit-impaired, having considered past repayment trends, the debt maturity profile of Sincere Property Group, the default risk on the amounts owing by Sincere Property Group and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group determined the lifetime expected credit losses ('ECL') to be recognised based on the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due from the investment in the bond in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive), discounted at the effective interest rate of the investment in the bond, which takes into account the adjusted financial position of Sincere Property Group (taking into account the estimated recoverable amounts of the properties held by Sincere Property Group and its associates and joint ventures, and potential additional costs to be incurred on borrowings of Sincere Property Group) and the debt profile of the Sincere Property Group.",

The discount assumptions used to estimate the difference between the fair value of the underlying properties and the expected sales price under a forced sale scenario are based on the market data available.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $288 million on the investment  in  the  bond.  At  the  reporting  date,  the  carrying  value  of  the  bond  was  $17.4  million  (net  of impairment loss) (2019: $311.6 million).\n\nChanges  to  circumstances  and  estimates  may  impact  the  expected  credit  losses  on  the  investment  in the  bond  recognised.  The  expected  credit  losses  on  the  investment  in  the  bond  can  be  sensitive  to  the assumptions  used.

The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards.

Shares in M&C Group are transferred to participants over three years (25% after years one and two, 50% after year three) if they continue to be employed.\n\nThe fair values for the deferred share awards were determined using the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The weighted average share price for deferred share awards granted in 2019 was \u00a36.80.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of M&C Group's ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities on 11 October 2019 (Delisting), the shares awarded under the ABP will be cash settled at a fixed price of \u00a36.85 in line with the final cash offer by the Company to acquire the remaining interest in M&C Group at \u00a36.85.",

These awards will vest over three years (25% after years one and two, 50% after year three), subject to the rules of the ESP.\n\nThe fair values for the awards were determined using the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The weightage average share price for awards granted in 2019 was \u00a36.80.\n\nFollowing the Delisting, the shares awarded under the ESP will be cash settled at a fixed price of \u00a36.85 in line with the final cash offer by the Company to acquire the remaining interest in M&C Group at \u00a36.85.\n\nThe variables used in estimating the fair value of options and awards granted under the M&C Group option schemes, presented in Sterling Pound, are as follows:\n\n|                           | Date of  grant   | Awards/ options  granted -

The most significant funds are described below:\n\n## United Kingdom (UK)\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a pension scheme for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993. The plan operates  a  funded  defined  benefit  arrangement  together  with  a  defined  contribution  plan,  both  with  different categories of membership. The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time, rights to a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) under the defined contribution scheme also ceased. The plan entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment.\n\nThe contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected  unit  credit  method.  The  last  full  actuarial  valuation  of  this  scheme  was  carried  out  by  a  qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2017 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2020. The contributions of the Group during the year were about 11% (2019: 11%) of pensionable salary.\n\nAs the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.\n\n## South Korea\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in South Korea. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2020. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\n## Taiwan\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2020. The contributions of the Group were no less than 6% (2019: 6%) of the employees' earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group. The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.\n\nThese defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.\n\nThe above plans are substantially  funded  by  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  The  funding  requirements  are  based  on pension funds' actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n102 D0ir0rDecDt0o0s'0 DSaSa\n\n## 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONT'D)\n\nThe assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions:\n\n|                           | 2020 UK   | 2020 South  Korea   | 2020 Taiwan   | 2019 UK   | 2019 South   Korea   | 2019 Taiwan   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|\n| Inflation rate            | 3.0%      | 2.0%                | -             | 3.0%      | 2.0%                 | -             |\n| Discount rate             | 1.3%      | 2.0%                | 0.5%          | 1.9%      | 2.0%                 | 0.8%          |\n| Rate of salary increase   | 3.5%      | -                   | 3.0%          | 3.5%      | 3.0%                 | 3.0%          |\n| Rate of pension increases | 2.9%      | -                   | -             | 2.9%      | -                    | -             |\n| Rate of revaluation       | 2.5%      | -                   | -             | 2.2%      | -                    | -             |\n\nThe methodology for computing the discount rate is the yield range method.\n\nThe assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily be borne out in practice. The present values of the schemes' liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  is  sensitive  to  the  assumptions  set  out  above.  The  following table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in one of the relevant actuarial assumptions by one percent, holding other assumptions consistent.\n\n| Defined benefit obligation   | Defined benefit obligation   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 1 percent                    | 1 percent                    |\n| increase                     | decrease                     |\n| $'000                        | $'000                        |\n\n## Group\n\n## 2020\n\n| Discount rate           | (23,130)   | 28,312   |\n|-------------------------|------------|----------|\n| Rate of salary increase | 1,806      | (1,664)  |\n| 2019                    |            |          |\n| Discount rate           | (23,038)   | 23,259   |\n| Rate of salary increase | 2,695      | (2,490)  |",

The  leases  of  hotel  properties  and  office  facilities  run for periods ranging from 2 to 136 years, with options to renew after lease expiry dates. Some leases provide for additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices. For certain leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub-lease arrangements.\n\nThe hotel properties leases were entered into many years ago as combined leases of land and buildings.\n\nThe Group also leases IT equipment and motor vehicles under a number of leases.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2020 $'000   | 2019 $'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                                     | 8,962        | 8,420        |\n| Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets presented in 'revenue'                                | 1,676        | 1,738        |\n| Expenses relating to short-term leases                                                            | 2,377        | 3,275        |\n| Expenses relating to leases of low-value assets, excluding short-term leases  of low-value assets | 426          | 942          |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 36 LEASES (CONT'D)\n\n## Amounts recognised in statement of cash flows\n\n|                               | 2020 $'000   | 2019 $'000   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Payment of lease liabilities  | 21,059       | 16,923       |\n| Interest expenses             | 8,962        | 8,420        |\n| Total cash outflow for leases | 30,021       | 25,343       |\n\n## Extension options\n\nSome property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The  Group  assesses  at  lease  commencement  date  whether  it  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  the  extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\n\nThe Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $41.6 million (2019: $40.4 million).\n\n## Leases as lessor\n\nThe Group leases out its investment properties consisting of its owned properties as well as leased properties (see note 5). All leases are classified as operating leases from a lessor perspective.\n\n## Operating lease\n\nThe  Group  and  the  Company  lease  out  some  of  their  investment  properties  and  development  properties.  The Group has classified these leases as operating leases, because they do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. Note 5 sets out information about the operating leases of investment properties.\n\nRental  income  from  investment  properties  and  property  subleases  recognised  by  the  Group  during  2020  was $348,906,000 (2019 : $423,093,000).\n\nThe  following  table  sets  out  a  maturity  analysis  of  lease  rental  receivables,  showing  the  undiscounted  lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\n|                      | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | 2020 $'000 | 2019 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2019 $'000 |\n| Less than one year   | 292,113    | 304,368    | 47,328     | 52,392     |\n| One to two years     | 224,177    | 220,921    | 30,434     | 38,634     |\n| Two to three years   | 149,880    | 154,703    | 16,904     | 23,977     |\n| Three to four years  | 106,910    | 111,971    | 6,376      | 12,740     |\n| Four to five years   | 89,320     | 136,484    | 678        | 6,084      |\n| More than five years | 348,620    | 347,499    | -          | 678        |\n| Total                | 1,211,020  | 1,275,946  | 101,720    | 134,505    |\n\nContingent rents, generally determined based on a percentage of tenants' revenue, of $6,666,000 (2019: $7,208,000) has been recognised as revenue by the Group, in profit or loss during the year.",

The Unit Trust, together with Highline GP, hold a 100% interest in ART Investments 2 Limited Partnership (which  was  subsequently  renamed  Highline  Investments  LP)  which  in  turn  owns  a  freehold  site located at Monk Bridge in Leeds, United Kingdom.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of assets.\n\n- (b) In  April  2019,  the  Group  through  its  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Astoria  Holdings  Limited, acquired  the  remaining  34.25%  of  the  PPS  that  related  to  the  non-residential  properties  owned by  Sunbright,  comprising  W  Hotel  and  Quayside  Isle  (Non-Residential  Component)  for  a  total consideration  of  S$77.9  million.  Following  the  acquisition,  the  Group's  effective  interest  in  the Non-Residential  Component  increased  from  65.75%  to  100%.  The  Non-Residential  Component was previously accounted for by the Group as an investment in associate, see note 44(a) for further information.\n\nThe acquisition provided the Group with the opportunity to enhance and create more value for its hotel operations as the properties are located on Sentosa Island which is poised to undertake new tourism attractions and improvements to its connectivity and attractiveness.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nFrom  the  date  of  acquisition  to  31  December  2019,  the  Non-Residential  Component  contributed revenue of $38.8 million and loss before tax of $1.8 million to the Group's results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, management estimated the Group's revenue for the year would have been $3,441 million, with no significant change to the Group's profit before tax.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 39 ACQUISITION OF AND LOSS OF CONTROL IN SUBSIDIARIES, AND CHANGES IN INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES WITHOUT LOSS OF CONTROL (CONT'D)\n\n- (II) Acquisition of subsidiaries (cont'd)\n\n## 2019 (cont'd)\n\n- (c) On 22 October 2019, the Group through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, City Sceptre Holdings Limited,  acquired  51%  of  the  common  units  in  Sceptre  Hospitality  Resources  (SHR)  for  a  total consideration of S$4.5 million (US$3.3 million) (Acquisition). On 28 November 2019, pursuant to the exercise of the conversion rights embedded in the convertible loans granted by the Group to a third party (Conversion), the convertible loans were converted into 24.1% of the common units in SHR.\n\nAs a consequence of the Conversion and the Acquisition, the Group owned 75.1% of the common units in SHR which became a subsidiary of the Group. The acquisition provided the Group with the opportunity to enhance its capability in providing customised solutions for the hospitality industry.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nThe contribution of SHR to the Group's revenue and profit before tax for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2019, and for the year had it been acquired on 1 January 2019, was insignificant.\n\nAs at 31 December 2019, the Group was committed to divest its investment in SHR, following an offer received from a third party. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of SHR had been classified as 'assets held for sale' and 'liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale' (see note 6).\n\n- (d) In November 2019, the Group through its two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries known as CDL China (Shanghai) Consulting Co., Ltd. (CDL China) and Bridge North Limited (Bridge North), acquired 100% of the shares and voting interest in Chongqing Jungao Enterprise Management Co., Ltd. (Chongqing Jungao) and Shanghai Yulan Real Estate Development Co., Ltd (Shanghai Yulan), respectively for a  total  consideration  of  approximately  $195  million  (RMB1,005  million).  Shanghai  Yulan  owns  a commercial property known as Shanghai Hongqiao Sincere Centre (Phase 2) located in Shanghai's Hongqiao Central Business District.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of assets.",

Management  is  responsible  for  developing  and  monitoring  the  Group's  risk  management  policies. Management reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Group has a system of controls in place to maintain an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. Management continually monitors the Group's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies  and  procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial years, the Group's policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes except for its use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost efficient.\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and debt investments.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $683.6 million (note 9) and subscribed for bonds of $305.4 million issued by Sincere Property Group (note 10). Impairment losses of $323.9 million (note 9) and $288.0 million (note 10) have been recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group and the bonds, respectively. As at 31 December 2019, the Group had loans due from Sincere Property Group of $540.6 million (note 9) and subscribed for bonds of $311.6 million (note 10) issued by Sincere Property Group, which collectively represent 14% of the Group's financial assets. In addition, the amounts owing  by  subsidiaries  and  joint  ventures  represent  88%  (2019:  87%)  of  the  Company's  financial  assets. Except as disclosed, there is no significant concentration of credit risk for the Group and the Company. The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the Group's and the Company's maximum exposures to credit risk, before taking into account any collateral held.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (i) Credit risk (cont'd)\n\nImpairment losses on trade and other receivables and debt investment recognised in profit or loss were as follows:\n\n|                   |      | Group      | Group      |\n|-------------------|------|------------|------------|\n|                   | Note | 2020 $'000 | 2019 $'000 |\n| Other receivables | 9    | 323,942    | -          |\n| Debt investment   | 10   | 288,000    | -          |\n| Trade receivables |      | 11,222     | 6,547      |\n|                   |      | 623,164    | 6,547      |\n\n## Trade and other receivables and contract assets\n\nThe Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets.\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk from trade receivables by collecting deposits as collateral, where possible. For trade receivables and contract assets relating to sale of development properties, if a purchaser defaults on payments, the Group may enforce payments via legal proceedings or if the purchaser is assessed to be insolvent, the Group may take possession of the units, retain a portion of the sales consideration, and resell the property.\n\nIn monitoring customer credit risk, the Group considers the trade history of the customers with the Group, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.\n\n## Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables and contract assets at the reporting date by business segment is set out below:\n\n|                       | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                       | 2020 $'000 | 2019 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2019 $'000 |\n| Property development  | 1,845,523  | 724,455    | 4,344,192  | 3,946,075  |\n| Hotel operations      | 125,962    | 142,414    | 160,052    | 159,479    |\n| Investment properties | 91,644     | 90,702     | 281,483    | 288,582    |\n| Others                | 60,680     | 32,491     | 1,035,338  | 1,120,002  |\n|                       | 2,123,809  | 990,062    | 5,821,065  | 5,514,138  |\n\n## Expected credit loss assessment on trade receivables\n\nThe Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from individual customers, which comprise a very large number of small balances.\n\nLoss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past 3 years (2019: 3 years). These rates are adjusted to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. The exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 is insignificant.",

The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The amount of the allowance on cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 was negligible.\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed adequate by management to finance the Group's operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.\n\nThe Group has provided financial guarantees to lenders to an associate (note 8) and a joint venture (notes 9(e) and 28). The Group has contractual commitments to incur capital expenditure on its property, plant and equipment and investment properties, purchase properties and to invest in joint ventures, associates and investees (see note 37).",

The cash inflows/(outflows) disclosed represent the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to derivative financial liabilities held for  risk  management  purposes  and  which  are  usually  not  closed  out  prior  to  contractual  maturity.  The disclosure shows net cash flow amounts for derivatives that are net cash-settled and gross cash inflow and outflow amounts for derivatives that have simultaneous gross cash settlement e.g. forward exchange contracts. Net-settled derivative financial assets are included in the maturity analyses as they are held to hedge the cash flow variability of the Group's floating rate loans.\n\nThe interest payments on variable interest rate loans and bonds and notes in the table above reflect market forward interest rates at the period end and these amounts may change as market interest rates changes. It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.\n\n## (iii) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations. The Group adopts a policy of managing its interest rate exposure by maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost of variable rate borrowings is considered to outweigh the benefits of their flexibility, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts. If a hedging relationship is directly affected by uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, then the Group assumes for this purpose that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nHedging relationships that are impacted by interest rate benchmark reform may experience ineffectiveness because of a timing mismatch between the hedged item and the hedging instrument regarding interest rate benchmark reform transition. For further details, see 'Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks' below.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (iii) Market risk (cont'd)\n\nInterest rate risk (cont'd)\n\nManaging interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks\n\n## Overview\n\nA  fundamental  reform  of  major  interest  rate  benchmarks  is  being  undertaken  globally,  including  the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as 'IBOR reform'). The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. There is uncertainty over the timing and the methods of transition in some jurisdictions that the Group operates in. The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its risk management and hedge accounting.\n\nManagement monitors and manages the Group's transition to alternative rates. The management evaluates the extent to which contracts reference IBOR cash flows, whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform with counterparties.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group holds interest rate swaps for risk management purposes which are designated in cash flow hedging relationships. The interest rate swaps have floating legs that are indexed to SOR and LIBOR. The Group's derivative instruments are governed by contracts based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)'s master agreements. On 23 October 2020, ISDA published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement, a  supplement  to  the  2006  ISDA  Definitions  ('the  Supplement')  and  the  IBOR  Fallbacks  Protocol  ('the Protocol'). Both the Supplement and the Protocol took effect on 25 January 2021. The Group is expected to negotiate the inclusion of new fallback clauses with its derivative counterparties. No derivative instruments have been modified as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group has evaluated the extent to which its cash flow hedging relationships are subject to uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at 31 December 2020. The Group's hedged items and hedging instruments continue to be indexed to IBOR benchmark rates which are SOR and LIBOR. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash flows are exchanged with its counterparties as usual.\n\nThe Group's SOR and LIBOR cash flow hedging relationships extend beyond the anticipated cessation date for IBOR. However, there is uncertainty about when and how replacement may occur with respect to the relevant hedged items and hedging instruments. Such uncertainty may impact the hedging relationship. The Group applies the amendments to SFRS(I) 9 issued in December 2019 to those hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform.",

This transition may occur at different times for the hedged item and hedging  instrument,  which  may  lead  to  hedge  ineffectiveness.  The  Group  has  measured  its  hedging instruments  indexed  to  Singapore-dollar  SOR  and  British-pound  sterling  LIBOR  using  available  quoted market rates for SOR-based and LIBOR-based instruments of the same tenor and similar maturity and has measured the cumulative change in the present value of hedged cash flows attributable to changes in SOR and LIBOR on a similar basis.\n\nThe Group enters into cross currency swap and interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk exposure arising from its SGD, GBP and USD variable rate term loan. As at the end of the financial year, the Group has cross currency swap and interest rate swap agreements with notional amount totalling $154,237,000 and $795,178,000 respectively (2019: $157,374,000 and $573,151,000 respectively) whereby it receives variable rate equal to SOR/LIBOR and pays fixed rates of between 0.38% to 2.70% (2019: 0.54% to 2.15%) on the notional amount.\n\nThe Group is actively engaging with lenders to include appropriate fall-back provisions in its floating-rate liabilities with maturities after 2021. We expect that the hedging instrument will be modified as outlined under 'Derivatives' above.\n\n## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments\n\nThe Group has fixed rate debt instruments measured at FVTPL. A change in interest rates at the reporting date would not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n- (iii) Market risk (cont'd)\n\nInterest rate risk (cont'd)\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) profit  or  loss  (before  any  tax  effect)  by  the  amounts  shown  below.  This  analysis  assumes  that  all  other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant and does not take into account the effect of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation.\n\n|                                             | Group                   | Group                   | Company                 | Company                 |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                             | 31 December  2020 $'000 | 31 December  2019 $'000 | 31 December  2020 $'000 | 31 December  2019 $'000 |\n| 100 bp increase                             |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| (Reduction)/Increase in profit   before tax | (69,863)                | (57,987)                | (19,823)                | (13,302)                |\n\nA 100bp decrease in interest rates at the reporting date would have had an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Australian Dollar, Sterling Pound, Renminbi, Japanese Yen and Euro.\n\nThe Group has a decentralised approach to the management of foreign currency risk. The Group manages its foreign currency exposure by adopting a natural hedge policy of matching receipts and payments, and asset purchases and borrowings, in the currency of the relevant entity, where possible. Entities in the Group may have different approaches to the identification and management of this risk. Entities in the Group may borrow in currencies other than their functional currencies to fund investments that are denominated in their borrowing currencies. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group's policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies  at  spot  rates  when  necessary  to  address  short-term  imbalances.  Where  feasible,  the  Group may put in place certain financial derivative instruments including forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency swaps to minimise the Group's exposure to movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions.",

The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.",

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Property development - develops and purchases properties for sale\n- \u00b7 Hotel operations - owns and manages hotels\n- \u00b7 Investment properties - develops and purchases investment properties for lease\n\nOthers comprises mainly investment in shares, management and consultancy services, and provision of laundry services. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2020 and 2019.\n\nInformation regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n\n## Information about reportable segments\n\n|                                                                     | Property  development $'000   | Hotel  operations $'000   | Investment properties $'000   | Total $'000   | Others $'000   | Total $'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 2020                                                                |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| Total revenue (including                                            |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| inter-segment revenue)                                              | 965,940                       | 658,669                   | 422,065                       | 2,046,674     | 183,779        | 2,230,453     |\n| Inter-segment revenue                                               | -                             | (18,224)                  | (60,647)                      | (78,871)      | (43,156)       | (122,027)     |\n| External revenue                                                    | 965,940                       | 640,445                   | 361,418                       | 1,967,803     | 140,623        | 2,108,426     |\n| (Loss)/Profit from  operating activities                            | (289,458)                     | (437,083)                 | (171,864)                     | (898,405)     | 46,761         | (851,644)     |\n| Share of after-tax (loss)/ profit of associates and  joint ventures | (404,913)                     | (98,366)                  | (367,629)                     | (870,908)     | 25,132         | (845,776)     |\n| Finance income                                                      | 76,681                        | 10,060                    | 47,947                        | 134,688       | 33,930         | 168,618       |\n| Finance costs                                                       | (122,154)                     | (48,004)                  | (83,456)                      | (253,614)     | (8,395)        | (262,009)     |\n| Net finance (costs)/income                                          | (45,473)                      | (37,944)                  | (35,509)                      | (118,926)     | 25,535         | (93,391)      |\n| Reportable segment  (loss)/profit before tax                        | (739,844)                     | (573,393)*                | (575,002)                     | (1,888,239)   | 97,428         | (1,790,811)   |\n| Depreciation and  amortisation                                      | 2,684                         | 140,366                   | 123,875                       | 266,925       | 20,204         | 287,129       |\n\n- * Hotel operations for 2020 comprise revenue and Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) attributable to hotel rooms owned by the Group amounting to $395.9 million and ($216.1) million respectively.",

Please refer to note (a) under note 44 of the financial statements.\n- ## Phuket Square Co., Ltd is considered a subsidiary of the Group as the Group is exposed to variable returns from the company and has the ability to affect those returns through the management's control over the financial and operating policies of the company.\n- ### CDL Hospitality Trusts is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (H-REIT), a real estate investment trust, and CDL Hospitality Business Trust (HBT), a business trust. H-REIT has an investment strategy of investing directly or indirectly,  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  income-producing  real estate which is primarily used for hospitality and/or hospitality-related purposes, whether wholly or partially, and real-estate related assets in relation to the foregoing.\n\nHBT is a business trust which currently acts as master lessee, asset owner and hotel operator. HBT may also undertake certain hospitality and hospitality-related development projects, acquisition and investments which may not be suitable for H-REIT.\n\nAlthough the Group owns less than half of the ownership interest and voting power of H-REIT and HBT, management has determined that the Group has control over H-REIT and HBT. The activities of H-REIT and HBT are managed by the Group's subsidiaries, M&C REIT Management Limited (H-REIT Manager) and M&C Business Trust Management Limited (HBT Trustee-Manager) respectively. H-REIT Manager has decisionmaking authority over H-REIT, subject to oversight by the trustee of H-REIT. HBT Trustee-Manager has dual responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the HBT unitholders and decision-making authority over HBT. The Group's overall exposure to variable returns, both from H-REIT Manager's and HBT Trustee-Manager's remuneration and the interests in H-REIT and HBT respectively, is significant and any decisions made by H-REIT Manager and HBT Trustee-Manager affect the Group's overall exposure.",

Ltd. (Cityview), the Group has determined that it does not have control over Cityview upon the sale of cash flows in Cityview as described below.  The Group has significant influence in Cityview through Sunbright Holdings Limited (Sunbright).  Accordingly, Cityview is reclassified as an associate of the Group.\n- i. Sale and purchase agreement\n- On 15 December 2014, Baynes Investment Pte. Ltd. (Baynes), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, sold  the  Dividends  (as  defined  in  the  sale  and  purchase  agreement)  in  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary, Cityview, to Sunbright.\n- ii. Profit participation securities\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria Holdings Limited (Astoria), subscribed for 37.5% interest in a capital instrument called profit participation securities (PPS) issued by Sunbright. The PPS has a tenor of 5 years and will expire upon final payment of the cash flows arising from the Dividends. The PPS carries a fixed payout amount (the Fixed Payout) at the rate of 5% per annum, which is payable on a semi-annual basis or, at the election of the PPS holders, payable upfront in one lump sum on the date of issue of the PPS.\n\nAstoria, together with other investors (the Third Party Investors), (collectively, the PPS Holders), elected to receive the Fixed Payout upfront and the total Fixed Payout of $187.5 million was offset against the consideration payable by the PPS holders for the subscription of the PPS.\n\nThe Group will receive from Sunbright the cash flows purchased from Baynes (after satisfying certain senior ranking liabilities, including capital contributions from the Third Party Investors) in accordance with a pre-agreed order of priority as set out under the terms of the PPS.\n\nIn  addition,  shares  of  Baynes  with  a  carrying  value  of  $1,502,000  (2019:  $1,502,000)  was  pledged  to Sunbright.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfiflGLYPH<29>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>flGLYPH<26>GLYPH<25>flGLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<22>flGLYPH<21>flGLYPH<20>GLYPH<19>flGLYPH<28>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<18>GLYPH<17>\n\n## 44 ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (CONT'D)\n\n- iii.  Investment Committees\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Group entered into an Investors' Agreement with the Third Party Investors and Sunbright. Under the Investors' Agreement, the management of the affairs of Sunbright and its subsidiaries are delegated to the Investment Committees where the Group has the right to appoint 5 out of 12 members. Taken as a whole, the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of Cityview.\n\nThe Group has determined that it has significant influence over Sunbright because of its representation on the Investment Committees. Accordingly, Sunbright is considered an associate of the Group.\n\nIn April 2019, the Group, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria, acquired the remaining PPS units in the non-residential component of Sunbright, which holds W Hotel and Quayside Isle (NonResidential  Component)  (note  39).  Following  the  acquisition,  the  Group  has  power  over  the  relevant activities of the Non-Residential Component, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group.\n\n- (b) In  2019,  although  the  Group  owned  less  than  20%  of  the  ownership  interest  and  voting  power  of  the investee, the Group has determined that it had significant influence over IREIT Global because of its board representation in IREIT Global Group Pte. Ltd. (the IREIT Manager), the governing body of IREIT Global, which is a joint venture of the Group. The IREIT Manager has decision-making authority over IREIT Global, subject to oversight by the trustee of the investee. Accordingly, IREIT Global was accounted for as an associate of the Group.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, City Strategic Equity Pte. Ltd., acquired additional 8.8% of total issued units in IREIT Global. The Group's interest in the units of IREIT Global increased to 21.3% as at 31 December 2020, from 12.6% as at 31 December 2019.\n\n- (c) Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in Emerging Markets Affordable Housing Fund Pte. Ltd. (the Fund), pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in the Fund, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the Fund. Accordingly, the Fund is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (d) During 2020, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sonic Investments Pte. Ltd., acquired a 63.75% equity interest in HCP Chongqing Property Development Co., Ltd (HCP), which owns 80.01% equity interest in Sincere Property Group.\n- Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in HCP, pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in HCP, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of HCP. Accordingly, HCP is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (e) Although the Group holds less than 50% voting interest in the IREIT Manager, pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in the IREIT Manager, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the IREIT Manager. Accordingly, the IREIT Manager is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (f) Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in South Beach Consortium Pte. Ltd. (South Beach), pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in South Beach, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of South Beach. Accordingly, South Beach is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n\nExcept as disclosed in notes 8 and 9, the Group does not consider the above associates and joint ventures to be individually material to the Group under the context of SFRS(I) 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.",

Ltd.,  which  holds  65%  equity  interest  in  Shenzhen  Longgang  District  Qidixiexin  Science  and Technology Development Park Co., Ltd. from Sincere Property Group and two third parties, for a consideration of approximately S$174 million (RMB850 million). The acquisition was funded through internal cash resources.\n\nThe Group has been closely monitoring the global disruptions and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020. As at the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Group has considered substantially the available information in their assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the Group. However, as the situation continues to evolve, any assumptions to assess the full impact of COVID-19 on the Group in the medium-to-longer term may not be meaningful.\n\n## STATISTICS OF ORDINARY SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n102 D2ir2e cto2s'si2\n\nClass of Shares\n\n:\n\nOrdinary Shares\n\nNo. of Issued Ordinary Shares\n\n:\n\n909,301,330\n\nNo. of Issued Ordinary Shares (excluding Treasury Shares) No. of Treasury Shares\n\n:\n\n906,901,330\n\n- : 2,400,000 (representing 0.26% of the total number of issued shares, excluding treasury shares)\n\nNo. of Subsidiary Holdings # Voting Rights\n\n- : Nil\n- : One vote for one Ordinary Share.\n- The  Company  cannot  exercise  any  voting  rights  in  respect  of  the  shares  held  as\n\ntreasury shares.\n\nSubject to the Companies Act, Chapter 50 of Singapore, subsidiaries cannot exercise any voting rights in respect of shares held by them as subsidiary holdings # .\n\n| Range of Ordinary Shareholdings   | No. of Ordinary  Shareholders   |      % | No. of Ordinary Shares   |      % |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|--------|\n| 1  -  99                          | 264                             |   1.41 | 8,453                    |   0    |\n| 100  -  1,000                     | 7,349                           |  39.25 | 5,745,630                |   0.63 |\n| 1,001  -  10,000                  | 9,806                           |  52.37 | 34,965,217               |   3.86 |\n| 10,001  -  1,000,000              | 1,278                           |   6.82 | 43,356,820               |   4.78 |\n| 1,000,001 and above               | 28                              |   0.15 | 822,825,210              |  90.73 |\n|                                   | 18,725                          | 100    | 906,901,330              | 100    |\n\nBased on information available to the Company as at 16 March 2021, approximately 51.31% of the issued Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares) is held by the public, and accordingly, Rule 723 of the Listing Manual of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited has been complied with.\n\n## MAJOR ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS LIST - TOP 20 AS AT 16 MARCH 2021\n\n| No.   | Name                                     | No. of Ordinary  Shares Held   | %*    |\n|-------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| 1     | Hong Leong Investment Holdings Pte.

Ordinary Resolution 7 of the Special Business above, if passed, will empower the Directors of the Company from the date of the Meeting until the next AGM (unless such authority is previously revoked or varied at a general meeting), to issue Ordinary Shares and/or make or grant Instruments that might require new Ordinary Shares to be issued up to a number not exceeding 100% of the total number of issued Ordinary Shares, excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings, of the Company, of which up to 10% may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders. The aggregate number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued under this Ordinary Resolution will be calculated based on the total number of issued Ordinary Shares, excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings, of the Company at  the  time  that  this  Ordinary  Resolution  is  passed,  after  adjusting  for  new  Ordinary  Shares  arising  from  the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which are outstanding or  subsisting at  the  time  this  Ordinary  Resolution  is  passed  and  any  subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of Ordinary Shares.\n- On 16 March 2021, SGX Regco announced an update to its news release issued on 8 April 2020, which allows Mainboard issuers to seek a general mandate for an issue of shares and convertible securities of up to an aggregate of 100% of its issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings), versus up to 50% previously (the 'Enhanced Share Issue Limit'), of which the aggregate number of shares and convertible securities issued other than on a pro rata basis remains at not more than 20%. Pursuant to the updated announcement by SGX Regco, the Enhanced Share Issue Limit will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM or on the date by which the next AGM is required by law or the Listing Manual of SGX-ST to be held, whichever is earlier and by which date any shares issued pursuant to the Enhanced Share Issue Limit must be listed, and no further shares may be issued under this limit.\n\nThe Company is proposing to avail itself to the Enhanced Share Issue Limit and accordingly is seeking shareholders' approval for the same at the Meeting. The Board of Directors is of the view that it would be in the interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so in the event that circumstances evolve before 2022 AGM amid the COVID-19 situation to such an extent that a 50% limit for pro rata issue of shares is not sufficient to meet the Company's needs. Under such circumstances, fund raising efforts would be unnecessarily hampered and compromised in view of the time needed to obtain shareholders' approval for the issue shares above the 50% threshold.\n\n- 10. Ordinary Resolution 8 of the Special Business above, if passed, will empower the Directors of the Company to make purchases or otherwise acquire the Company's issued Ordinary Shares and/or Preference Shares (collectively, the 'Shares') from time to time subject to and in accordance with the guidelines set out in Annexure I of the Letter to Shareholders. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, unless previously revoked or varied at a general meeting or when such purchases or acquisitions are carried out to the full extent mandated.\n\nThe Company intends to use internal resources and/or external borrowings to finance purchases or acquisitions of its Shares under the Share Purchase Mandate. The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits of the Company, the aggregate number of Shares purchased or acquired, the consideration paid at the relevant time and whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.\n\nBased on the existing number of issued Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares of the Company as at 16 March 2021 (the 'Latest Practicable Date') (disregarding the Ordinary Shares held in treasury), the exercise in full of the Share Purchase Mandate would result in the purchase of 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares (representing 10% of the total number of issued Ordinary Shares of the Company, disregarding the Ordinary Shares held in treasury) and 33,087,425 Preference Shares (representing 10% of the total number of issued Preference Shares of the Company).\n\nIn  the  case  of  Market  Purchases  and  Off-Market  Purchases  by  the  Company  and  assuming  that  the  Company purchases or acquires 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price of $7.89 for one Ordinary Share (being the  price  equivalent  to  105%  of  the  Average  Closing  Price  as  at  the  Latest  Practicable  Date)  and  33,087,425 Preference Shares at the Maximum Price of $1.15 for one Preference Share (being the price equivalent to 105% of the Average Closing Price as at the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required for the purchase or acquisition of 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares and 33,087,425 Preference Shares is approximately $761 million and $38 million respectively.\n\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Shares pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 based on these assumptions are set out in paragraph 3.5 of Annexure I of the Letter to Shareholders.\n\n- 11. Ordinary Resolution 9 of the Special Business above, if passed, will renew the IPT Mandate which was last approved by shareholders on 24 June 2020, to facilitate the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies to enter into Interested Person Transactions, the details of which are set out in Annexure II and Appendix A of the Letter to Shareholders. The IPT Mandate will continue in force until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, unless previously revoked or varied at a general meeting.\n\nVoting restriction pursuant to Rule 921(7) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST Hong Leong Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries, the Directors of the Company and their associates, who are also shareholders of the Company and being Interested Persons under the IPT Mandate, are required to abstain from voting at the Meeting in respect of the Ordinary Resolution 9 in relation to the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\n## MEETING NOTES:\n\n- 1.
