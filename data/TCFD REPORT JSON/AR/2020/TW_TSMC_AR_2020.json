According to TSMC's Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than the other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.\n\nNote 2: Mr. Ming-Hsin Kung was appointed as the representative of National Development Fund on July 24, 2020.\n\nNote 3:  Mr. Yancey Hai was elected as TSMC's independent director at TSMC's Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 9, 2020.\n\nNote 4: Pensions funded according to applicable law.\n\nNote 5:  The above-mentioned figures include expenses for Company cars and related reimbursements, but do not include compensation paid to Company drivers (totaled NT$3,810,232).

We believe that the basis for successful corporate governance is a sound and effective Board of Directors. In line with this principle, the TSMC Board delegates various responsibilities and authority to two Board Committees, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Each Committee has a written charter approved by the Board. Each Committee's chairperson regularly reports to the Board on the activities and actions of the relevant committee.\n\n## 2020 Corporate Governance Awards and Ratings\n\n| Organization                                             | Awards                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI)                  | Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 20 th  consecutive year Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index                                                                                             |\n| RobecoSAM (S&P Global)                                   | The Sustainability Yearbook Award 2020 - Gold Class                                                                                                                                                              |\n| MSCI ESG Indexes                                         | MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index component  MSCI ACWI SRI Index component MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Leaders Index                                                                                                     |\n| Sustainalytics                                           | 'Top Rated' within the Semiconductor Industry                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| FTSE4Good Index                                          | FTSE4Good Emerging Index component FTSE4Good All-World Index component FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index component                                                                                                  |\n| Wall Street Journal                                      | The 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies in the World                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Corporate Knights                                        | Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) | 2021 IEEE Corporate Innovation Award                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Institutional Investor Magazine                          | Most Honored Company (Technology/Semiconductors) - All-Asia  Best ESG Metrics (Technology/Semiconductors) - 1 st  Place (buy-side and sell-side) - All-Asia                                                      |\n| FORTUNE                                                  | 2020 World's Most Admired Companies Fortune Global 500                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Forbes                                                   | World's Best Employers                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Taiwan Stock Exchange                                    | Top 5% in Corporate Governance Evaluation of Listed Companies for the 6 th  consecutive year                                                                                                                     |\n| CommonWealth Magazine                                    | Corporate Social Responsibility Award - Large cap - 1 st  Place                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Taiwan Institute of Sustainable Energy                   | The Most Prestigious Sustainability Awards - Top Ten Domestic Corporates - for the 5 th  consecutive year Taiwan Top 50 Corporate Responsibility Report Awards - IT & IC Manufacturing Industry - Platinum Award |\n\n## 3.2 Board of Directors\n\n## Board Structure\n\nTSMC's Board of Directors consists of ten distinguished members with a great breadth of experience as world-class business leaders or professionals. We deeply rely on them for their diverse knowledge, personal perspectives, and solid business judgment. Six of those ten members are Independent Directors: former British Telecommunications Chief Executive Officer, Sir Peter L. Bonfield; Co-Founder, Chairman Emeritus of the Acer Group, Mr. Stan Shih; former Chairman of National Performing Arts Center and former Advisor of Executive Yuan, R.O.C., Ms. Kok-Choo Chen; former Chairman of Applied Materials, Inc., Mr. Michael R. Splinter; former Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx, Inc., Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov; and currently Chairman of Delta Electronics Inc., Mr. Yancey Hai. Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board.\n\nTSMC's Board is comprised of a diverse group of professionals from different backgrounds in industries, academia, law, etc. These professionals include citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experience, one of whom is female.\n\n## Board Responsibilities\n\nInheriting the spirit of TSMC's Founder, Dr. Morris Chang's philosophy on corporate governance, under the leadership of Chairman Dr. Mark Liu and CEO & Vice Chairman Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC's Board of Directors takes a serious and forthright approach to its duties and is a dedicated, competent and independent Board.\n\nThe Board's primary duty is to supervise the Company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations, financial transparency, timely disclosure of material information, and maintaining of the highest integrity. TSMC's Board of Directors strives to perform these responsibilities through its Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, the hiring of a financial expert consultant for the Audit Committee, and coordination with our Internal Audit department.\n\nThe second duty of the Board of Directors is to evaluate the management's performance and to appoint and dismiss officers of the Company when necessary. TSMC's management has maintained a healthy and functional communication with the Board of Directors, has been devoted in executing guidance of the Board, and is dedicated in running the business operations, all to achieve the best interests for TSMC shareholders.\n\nThe third duty of the Board of Directors is to resolve important, concrete matters, such as capital appropriations, investment activities, dividends, etc.\n\nThe fourth duty of the Board of Directors is to provide guidance to the management team of the Company. Quarterly, TSMC's management reports to the Board on a variety of subjects (including CSR/ESG programs). The management also reviews the Company's business strategies with the Board and updates TSMC's Board on the progress of those strategies, obtaining Board guidance as appropriate.\n\n## Nomination and Election of Directors\n\nTSMC envisions the membership of its esteemed Board of Directors to be composed of highly ethical professionals with the necessary knowledge, experience and understanding from diverse backgrounds. TSMC established 'Guidelines for Nomination of Directors', which describes the procedures and criteria for the nomination, qualification and evaluation of candidates for Directors. In addition, TSMC envisions its Board to be composed of a majority of independent directors, with the independence of each independent director candidate considered and assessed under relevant laws.\n\nDirectors shall be elected pursuant to the candidate nomination system specified in Article 192-1 of the R.O.C. Company Law. The tenure of office for Directors shall be three years. The independence of each independent director candidate is also considered and assessed under relevant law such as the Taiwan 'Regulations Governing Appointment of Independent Directors and Compliance Matters for Public Companies'. Under R.O.C. law, in which TSMC was incorporated, any shareholders holding one percent or more of our total outstanding common shares may nominate their own candidate to stand for election as a Board member. This democratic mechanism allows our shareholders to become involved in the selection and nomination process of Board candidates. The final slate of candidates is put to the shareholders for voting at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting.\n\nThere are no limits on the number of terms that a director may serve. We believe the Company benefits from the contributions of directors who have over their years of dedicated service acquired unique insights into the operations and financial developments of the Company. The Company reviews the appropriateness of each director's continued service to ensure there are new viewpoints available to the Board.\n\n## Directors' Compensation\n\nAccording to TSMC's Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine the salary for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Directors, taking into account the extent and value of the services provided for the management of the Corporation and the standards of the industry within the R.O.C. and overseas.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also state that not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits may be distributed as compensation to our directors. In addition, directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive any director compensation. According to TSMC's Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.",

TSMC strictly adheres to the highest standards of integrity and promotes good ethical behavior to sustain the hard-earned trust and confidence of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and the general public - constantly and vigilantly promoting integrity, fairness, and transparency in all that we say and do. We have zero tolerance for corruption, refrain from bribery, fraud, waste of corporate assets, and prohibit the advancement of personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with TSMC. At the heart of our corporate governance culture is the 'TSMC Ethics and Business Conduct Policy' (Ethics Code). The Ethics Code requires that each employee bear a heavy personal responsibility to preserve and to protect TSMC's ethical values and reputation. At the same time, we have formulated the 'TSMC's Supplier Code of Conduct' as well to ensure our suppliers understand and follow the Ethics Code and together fulfill our corporate social responsibilities.\n\nMajor Ethics Code Obligations\n\n- \u25cf  Do not advance personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with the Company;\n- \u25cf  Refrain from corruption, bribery, unfair competition, fraud, extortion, collusion, embezzlement, and waste or abuse of corporate assets;\n- \u25cf  Avoid any improper efforts to influence the decisions of anyone, including government officials, agencies, as well as TSMC's customers and suppliers;\n- \u25cf  Do not undertake any practices detrimental to TSMC, to the environment, or to society;\n- \u25cf  Procure all of our raw materials from socially responsible sources;\n- \u25cf  Protect proprietary information of TSMC, our customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf  Abide by the letter of all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nIntellectual Property Protection: In order to build and sustain an environment of innovation, technology leadership, and sustainable profitable growth, the Ethics Code requires that TSMC promotes business relationships founded upon an unwavering respect for the intellectual property rights, proprietary information and trade secrets of TSMC, our customers, and others.\n\nPublic Disclosures: TSMC's officers, especially our CEO, CFO, and General Counsel, with oversight from our Board,\n\nare responsible for the full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable financial accounting and financial disclosure in reports and documents filed by the Company with securities authorities and in all TSMC public communications and disclosures. TSMC has a variety of measures in place to ensure compliance with these disclosure obligations.\n\nAny modification to the Ethics Code requires the approval of our Audit Committee to ensure our ethics compliance program is independently reviewed against corporate best practices.\n\n## Ethics Code Implementation\n\nHigh Standard Ethical Culture: Our ethics program is implemented in four ways by all of TSMC's employees, officers and Board members. First, TSMC's management sets the 'tone from the top' by acting in accordance with the Ethics Code so that they may be an example to all stakeholders. Second, working-level managers are responsible for ensuring their staff's understanding of and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Third, TSMC encourages an environment of open communications in discussing any questions related to the Ethics Code. Any employee may consult his or her direct supervisors, Human Resources or Legal to obtain timely advice. Lastly, TSMC requires all employees to stay vigilant and report any noncompliance by anyone to their supervisors, the function head of Human Resources, the responsible corporate senior management appointed by CEO that oversees the Ombudsman system, or to the Chairman of the Company's Audit Committee directly.\n\n## Self-Assessment of All Departments and Employees:\n\nSelf-assessment of all departments and employees is an important part of our ethics compliance program. All departments and subsidiaries of TSMC are required to conduct Control Self-Assessment (CSA) tests annually to review employees' awareness of the Ethics Code. The CSA results are reviewed to track the results of our compliance program. In addition, all employees must disclose any matters that cause, or may cause, actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition to this proactive disclosure requirement, employees with specific job grades or job responsibilities must annually declare any relationships that may constitute a conflict of interest, which enables TSMC to take necessary arrangements and report the results to the Audit Committee.\n\nInternal Auditing: The Internal Auditor of TSMC plays a critical role in ensuring the Company's compliance with the Ethics Code and relevant rules and regulations. To ensure that our",

In terms of training courses, TSMC not only provides annual online course on the Ethics Code and requires all employees to complete the training, as well as face-to-face training courses delving into more specific ethics-related topics for targeted employees. In 2020, there were about 50,482 attendances that completed ethics-related training courses at TSMC and its subsidiaries. TSMC not only provides annual online courses on professional ethics and requires colleagues to complete the training.\n\nIn addition to our internal compliance efforts, we expect and assist our business partners such as customers and suppliers, and any other entities with whom we deal (include consultants or third party agents who act for or on behalf of TSMC) to recognize and understand TSMC's ethical standards to fulfill our responsibilities as a corporate citizen. For instance, we require all of our suppliers to declare in writing that they will respect and comply with TSMC's ethical standards and culture. TSMC is a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance ('RBA', formerly the (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, EICC)), dedicated to electronics supply chain sustainability. In addition to adopting the RBA Code of Conduct at all of its facilities, TSMC applied the RBA's standards to enhance our audit program of our suppliers and relevant business partners. We provide training and communicate our ethical culture to our suppliers through live seminars to prevent any unethical conduct and detect any sign of Ethics Code violations. In 2020, we held both a sustainable supply chain experience exchange and our annual Responsible Supply Chain Forum to share/ exchange practical experiences on topics such as the Ethics Code, labor rights, environmental protection, and occupational safety. In total, 518 attendees from 337 suppliers participated in these activities. We also exchange views on appropriate business conduct and TSMC's ethical standards and implementation status with our customers as part of customer audit programs.\n\n## Reporting Channels and Whistleblower Protection\n\nTo ensure that our conduct meets relevant legal requirements and the highest ethical standards under the Ethics Code, TSMC provides multiple channels for reporting business conduct concerns. First of all, our Audit Committee approved and we have implemented the 'Complaint Policy and Procedures for Certain Accounting and Legal Matters' and 'Procedures for Ombudsman System' that allow employees or any whistleblowers with relevant evidence to report any financial, legal, or ethical irregularities anonymously through either the Ombudsman or directly to the Audit Committee. TSMC maintains additional internal reporting channels for our employees. To foster an open culture of ethics compliance, we encourage our employees and the third parties we do business with to report any suspected noncompliance with law or relevant TSMC policy.\n\nTSMC treats any complaint and the investigation thereof in a confidential and sensitive manner, and strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against any individual who in good faith reports or helps with the investigation of any complaint.\n\nDue to the open reporting channels, TSMC receives reports on various issues from employees and external parties such as our customers and suppliers from time to time. Below is a summary of the Number of Reported Incidents.\n\n| Year                                                 |   FY2016 |   FY2017 |   FY2018 |   FY2019 | FY2020       |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|\n| Total reported cases                                 |      116 |      113 |      150 |      205 | 246 (Note 1) |\n| Ethics-related cases                                 |       16 |       20 |       14 |       26 | 22           |\n| Cases investigated and verified as ethics violations |        2 |        4 |        1 |        2 | 6 (Note 2)   |\n| Sexual Harassment Investigation Committees Formed    |        5 |        7 |        3 |        4 | 4            |\n| Cases investigated and verified as violations        |        5 |        3 |        3 |        4 | 2 (Note 3)   |\n\n## Ethics Code Violation Disciplinary Action\n\nWe do not tolerate any violation of the Ethics Code and treat every possible violation incident seriously. Any violator of the Ethics Code (or relevant regulations) will be severely disciplined to the full extent of our policies and the law, up to and including immediate dismissal, termination of business relationship, and judicial prosecution as appropriate.\n\n## 3.5.1  Taiwan Corporate Conduct and Ethics Implementation as Required by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission\n\n|

In addition, to educate and remind our employees of their responsibilities under  the Ethics Code, we publish our Ethics Code, relevant policies and documents on  our intranet and promote its awareness through training courses, posters, and  internal news articles. Furthermore, to ensure that our conduct meets relevant  legal requirements and the highest ethical standards under the Ethics Code, TSMC  provides multiple channels for reporting business conduct concerns. Please refer to  Assessment Item 3 for details.   We do not tolerate any violation of the Ethics Code and treat every possible  violation incident seriously.

To comply with governing legislation, applicable laws, regulations and regulatory expectations, we closely monitor domestic and foreign government policies and regulatory developments that could materially impact TSMC's business and financial operations. Our Legal organization periodically updates our relevant internal departments, management and the Audit Committee of applicable regulatory changes so that internal teams ensure compliance with new regulatory requirements in a timely manner. We are also a proactive advocate for legislative and regulatory reform, and our comments and recommendations on legal reforms to the government have been accepted constructively. TSMC is increasingly dedicated to identifying potential regulatory issues and will continue to be involved in advocating public policy changes that foster a positive and fair business environment.\n\n## Policy and Compliance Program Development and Implementation\n\nUnder the framework of the Ethics Code, TSMC has established a regulatory compliance program that includes policies, guidelines and procedures in different compliance areas, including: Anti-corruption, Anti-harassment, Anti-discrimination, Employment Regulations, Antitrust (unfair competition), Environment, Export Control, Financial Reporting, Insider Trading, Intellectual Property, Proprietary Information Protection (PIP), Personal Data Protection, Record Retention and Disposal, as well as procuring certain raw materials from socially responsible sources ('Conflict-free Minerals'). It is our belief that these policies are crucial in strengthening overall compliance with the Ethics Code and compliance program. TSMC, its employees and its subsidiaries are expected to fully understand and comply with all laws and regulations that govern our businesses, as well as relevant policies, guidelines and procedures, and make ethical decisions in every circumstance.\n\n## Compliance Awareness Training\n\nTraining is one of the major component of our regulatory compliance program.

        "page_content": "## Major Accomplishments\n\nIn 2020, TSMC achieved several major accomplishments in regulatory compliance. Externally, in addition to fulfilling the Company's obligations toward regulatory compliance matters, TSMC exercised its civic duties as a responsible corporate citizen by providing feedback on current regulations and regulations in legislation, with the intent to improve Taiwan's industrial investment environment, enhance economic development, and help align domestic laws with international law. Furthermore, TSMC continues to focus on the topics related to the Company Law, the Securities and Exchange Act, intellectual property protection and environment protection. In addition, TSMC advised government agencies on recent revisions to corporate governance, trade secrets and environmental protection regulations.\n\nInternally, TSMC provides multiple courses about legal and regulatory compliance, including anti-corruption, anti-trust, anti-harassment, insider trading, export control, and protection of confidential and personal information. These courses are taught by both internal and external experts and law professionals. The important achievements are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf  Ethics and Compliance: providing an 'Annual Ethics and Compliance Training Course' (mandatory 0.5 hour online course) covering various important regulatory compliance topics - a total of about 50,482 employees completed this training course - with all production staffs were starting from 2019.\n- \u25cf  Export Compliance: TSMC's export management system (EMS) and policy have been in place for a number of years. It aims to ensure that TSMC and its subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable regulations covering the export of information, technologies, products, materials and equipment. TSMC's EMS was certified in September 2012 by the Bureau of Foreign Trade, the Taiwan regulator, as a qualified ICP (Internal Compliance Program) exporter. In 2018, TSMC successfully extended the validity period of its ICP certificate to October 2021. In addition, TSMC implements 'No ECCN, No Shipment' control and customers are required to provide end use and export control classification number (ECCN) of their products, among other required information, for TSMC to apply for applicable export licenses. To further enhance relevant employees' awareness of the export control requirements, in 2020 TSMC altogether provided more than 20 face-to-face communication sessions and on-line learning program to employees in relevant functions - a total of 1,272 employees completed these sessions or the programs as requested.\n- \u25cf  Supplier Management: TSMC shares and exchanges practical experiences with suppliers with sales offices in Taiwan by holding both a sustainable supply chain experience exchange and  annual Responsible Supply Chain Forums on topics such as Ethics Code, labor rights, environmental protection and occupational safety. In total, 518 attendees from 347 suppliers were participated in these activities.\n- \u25cf  Conflict-Free Supply Chain: As a recognized global leader in the hi-tech supply chain, we acknowledge our corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all persons. Meanwhile, we have implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with industry leading practices, requesting suppliers to fill in the 'Conflict Minerals Reporting Template' and sign the 'TSMC Conflict-Free Minerals Declaration' every year. TSMC will continuously make progress to ensure a conflict-free supply chain.\n- \u25cf  Personal Data Protection: Because of the importance of personal data protection, TSMC periodically reviews the Rules of Privacy and Personal Data Protection and external and internal privacy policies to identify the needs to update such documents. Based on current personal data protection laws and risks, TSMC conducts an annual training on privacy and personal data protection to enhance employees' awareness and compliance. In addition, a personal data protection committee composed of Legal, Human Resources, and IT divisions convene on an annual basis to assist the implementation of and monitoring compliance with the rules.\n- \u25cf  Antitrust Compliance: Based on annual antitrust risk assessment results, TSMC identified functions with potential higher risk from an antitrust perspective. To enhance targeted functions' employee awareness of the importance of competition and antitrust laws and issues during daily operations, TSMC established antitrust training programs and conducted several antitrust trainings, via either face-to-face onsite training sessions or on-line learning programs, for global sales personnel and employees in relevant departments at Taiwan, United States, Europe, Japan, Korea and mainland China areas - a total of 841 employees completed the on-line program as requested.\n\n## 3.7 Internal Control System Execution Status\n\n## 3.7.1 Statement of Internal Control System\n\n## Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\n## Statement of Internal Control System\n\nFebruary 09, 2021\n\nBased on the findings of a self-assessment, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) states the following with regard to its internal control system during the year 2020:\n\n- 1.  TSMC's Board of Directors and management are responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an adequate internal control system. Internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance over the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations (including profitability, performance and safeguarding of assets), reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of our reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 2.  An internal control system has inherent limitations. No matter how perfectly designed, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of accomplishing its stated objectives. Moreover, the effectiveness of an internal control system may be subject to changes due to extenuating circumstances beyond our control. Nevertheless, our internal control system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and TSMC takes immediate remedial actions in response to any identified deficiencies.\n- 3.  TSMC evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system based on the criteria provided in the Regulations Governing the Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies (herein below, the 'Regulations'). The criteria adopted by the Regulations identify five key components of managerial internal control: (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control activities, (4) information and communication, and (5) monitoring activities. Each component also includes several items which can be found in the Regulations.\n- 4.  TSMC has evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system according to the aforesaid Regulations.\n- 5.  Based on the findings of such evaluation, TSMC believes that, on December 31, 2020, it has maintained, in all material respects, an effective internal control system (that includes the supervision and management of our subsidiaries), to provide reasonable assurance over our operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 6.  This Statement is an integral part of TSMC's annual report and prospectus, and will be made public. Any falsehood, concealment, or other illegality in the content made public will entail legal liability under Articles 20, 32, 171, and 174 of the Securities and Exchange Law.\n- 7.  This Statement was passed by the Board of Directors in their meeting held on February 09, 2021, with none of the ten attending directors expressing dissenting opinions, and the remainder all affirming the content of this Statement.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Liu,\n\nChairman\n\nC.C.

The Company's profits may be distributed by way of cash dividend, stock dividend, or a combination of cash and stock. Pursuant to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, distributions of profits shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. In addition, the ratio for stock dividends shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution. Distribution of stock dividends is subject to approval by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission.\n\nIn the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 5, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved the amendments to TSMC's Articles of Incorporation to authorize the Company's Board of Directors to approve quarterly cash dividends after the close of each quarter. After the Company's Board of Directors approves quarterly cash dividends, TSMC will distribute the dividend within six months. The respective amounts and payment dates of 2020 quarterly cash dividends are demonstrated in the table below.

In 2020, following the transfer to manufacturing of 5nm technology, the Company's R&D organization continued to fuel the pipeline of technological innovation needed to maintain industry leadership. While TSMC's 3nm technology, the sixth generation platform to make use of 3D transistors, continues full development with major customers completed IP design and started silicon validation, the Company has proceeded into full development of 2nm technology, which is the leading edge technology in the semiconductor industry today. At the same time, the Company's research and pathfinding pushed forward with exploratory studies for nodes beyond 2nm.\n\nIn addition to complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic, TSMC conducts R&D on a wide range of other semiconductor technologies that provide the functionalities required by customers for mobile SoC and other applications. Highlights in 2020 include:\n\n- \u25cf  Accomplished process validation of system-on-integrated-chip (SoIC) for both chip-on-wafer (CoW) and wafer-on-wafer (WoW) stacking using micron-level bonding-pitch processes with promising electrical yield and reliability results\n- \u25cf  Developed the fifth generation (Gen-5) chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS \u00ae ) with record-breaking Si interposer area up to 2,400mm 2 , which is equivalent to the size of three full reticles.

        "page_content": "## 5.2.2 R&D Accomplishments in 2020\n\n## Highlights\n\n## \u25cf  3nm Technology\n\nIn 2020, TSMC focused on the manufacturing baseline process setup, yield learning, transistor and interconnect R/C performance improvement, and reliability evaluation of 3nm technology, which offers significant density improvement with better performance at same power or lower power consumption at comparable performance compared to 5nm technology. During the year, major customers completed IP design and started silicon validation. TSMC plans to complete 3nm technology qualification for risk production in 2021.\n\n## \u25cf  2nm Technology\n\nIn 2020, following initial research and pathfinding, TSMC proceeded into the development stage of 2nm technology, focusing on testkey and test vehicle design and implementation, mask making and Si pilot runs.\n\n## \u25cf  Lithography Technology\n\nThe focus for R&D lithography in 2020 was on 3nm and 2nm technology development and preparation of technology development of next-generation nodes and beyond. In 3nm technology development, EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography showed good imaging capability with expected wafer yield. TSMC R&D is working on reduction of mask defects in EUV scanner and overlay errors while lowering overall cost. In 2021, TSMC will focus intensely on improving EUV quality and reducing costs in 2nm technology and beyond.\n\nIn 2020, the Company's EUV program made continuous improvement in light-source power and stability, enabling faster learning rates and process development for advanced nodes. Additional progress was made with resist process, pellicle, and related mask blanks. EUV technology has been adopted for full scale manufacturing.\n\n## \u25cf  Mask Technology\n\nMask technology is very crucial in advanced lithography. In 2020, the R&D organization successfully completed 3nm node mask technology development, which largely implemented complicated and advanced EUV mask technology. Continuous advancement of EUV mask technology was made to meet mask requirements for 2nm node lithography.\n\n## Integrated Interconnect and Packaging\n\nWafer level system integration (WLSI) technologies have evolved quickly with various platforms mixed and matched in increasingly complex application scenarios. All such\n\ntechnologies come under the umbrella of wafer level integration, which TSMC has named 3DFabric TM for its enablement of fine pitch chip-to-chip connection and a unified fabrication philosophy leveraging existing wafer processes. Under 3DFabric TM , all processes with chips that are embedded before interconnection are called Integrated Fan-Out (InFO), while all processes that start with making re-distribution interconnection (RDL) followed by chip placement onto pre-made RDL are called CoWoS \u00ae . This new nomenclature more accurately reflects the nature of the processes involved and points to their future technology paths. Along with their siblings, SoIC, system-on-wafer (SoW), and systemon-integrated-substrate (SoIS), they form a universal WLSI technology family that will lead the industry in meeting the future scaling needs as required by increasingly challenging and more diversified computing systems integration.\n\n## \u25cf  3DIC and TSMC-SoIC TM\n\nTSMC-SoIC TM is an innovative wafer-level frontend 3DIC chip stacking platform with outstanding bonding density, interconnect bandwidth, power efficiency, and thin profile. It extends Moore's Law through system-level scaling with sustainable performance gains and cost benefits. A SoIC integrated chip can be subsequently assembled using conventional packages or using TSMC's new 3DFabric TM technologies, such as CoWoS or InFO, for next generation HPC, AI and mobile applications. Currently, TSMC has achieved process validation for both CoW and WoW stacking using micron-level bonding-pitch processes with promising electrical yield and reliability results. TSMC will keep pursuing the scaling of SoIC technologies to align with the Company's other advanced Si technologies for further improved transistor density, system power, performance, and area (PPA), and cost competitiveness.\n\n## \u25cf  Chip-Last CoWoS \u00ae\n\nCoWoS \u00ae with Si interposer is the leading 2.5D technology for high-end HPC and AI product applications. The technology features a large Si interposer with sub-micron routing layers and iCap (integrated capacitors), so that various chiplets such as SoC and high bandwidth memory (HBM) can be placed on it. The CoWoS \u00ae Gen-5 now under development has displayed a record-breaking Si interposer area up to 2,400mm 2 , which is equivalent in size to three full reticles. Qualification completion is targeted in the first half of 2021.\n\n## \u25cf  Chip-First InFO\n\nIn 2020, TSMC continued its industry leadership in high-volume manufacturing of InFO-PoP Gen-5 packaging for\n\nmobile applications and InFO-oS Gen-2 for HPC chip-partition applications. InFO-PoP Gen-6 was also successfully qualified for mobile applications and displayed enhanced thermal performance. InFO-oS Gen-3, which provides more chip-partition integration with larger package size and higher bandwidth, was developed on schedule. To meet demand of HPC applications, TSMC developed ultra-high bandwidth InFO Local Silicon Interconnect (InFO\\_LSI) technology, in which SoC chiplets are integrated into a 3D InFO package through ultra-high density local Si interconnects (LSI). InFO without substrate, which uses multi-die heterogeneous integration and finer-pitch die-to-die interconnection, was successfully qualified for consumer applications. The newest generation IPD (integrated passive device) technology, which provides higher density capacitors and low ESL (effective series inductance) for improved electrical performance, passed qualification on InFO-PoP. This enhanced InFO-PoP will benefit both AI and 5G mobile applications. High volume manufacturing of the newest IPD is scheduled to begin in 2021.\n\n## \u25cf  Advanced Interconnect\n\nTSMC provides innovative technologies to enable small-dimensional interconnect and boost chip performance. In 2020, a brand-new hybrid interconnect was proposed as a future interconnect architecture. At small geometries, this new architecture shows promising potential to resolve Cu gap-fill difficulty and significantly reduce both interconnect resistance and capacitance. Developing innovative solutions such as these helps TSMC maintain its global technology leadership.\n\n## Corporate Research\n\nInnovation in devices and materials continues to drive higher performance and reduced power consumption in advanced logic technologies. In 2020, TSMC stayed at the forefront of 2D and carbon nanotube (CNT) transistor research. TSMC successfully demonstrated a process to synthesize one-atomic-layer thick, single-crystal, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on full 2-inch wafers, a significant achievement as hBN has been shown to be an ideal passivation layer for 2D device channels. This outstanding fundamental research result was published in the March 2020 issue of Nature, one of the world's leading science journals.\n\nAt the 2020 Symposia on VLSI Technology, TSMC demonstrated the highest nFET current for 2D-FETs at a drain voltage of 1V, with CVD MoS 2 monolayer channel. And at the 2020 International Electron Device Meeting, the Company introduced a novel interfacial layer dielectric (ILX), which could nucleate on CNT a continuous sub-0.5nm thickness film, which allows growth of high-k gate dielectric (hafnium oxide) on CNT\n\nby conventional ALD. Enabled by this novel ILX, top-gate CNT transistors with gate length down to 15nm were demonstrated with nearly ideal gate control.\n\nTSMC continues to search and explore emerging high-density, non-volatile memory hardware accelerators for AI and HPC applications. The Company's corporate research is well positioned to pave the way for continued node-to-node density scaling, performance enhancement, and power reduction as it has done in the past.\n\n## Specialty Technologies\n\nTSMC offers a broad array of technologies to address a wide range of applications:\n\n## \u25cf  Mixed Signal/Radio Frequency (MS/RF)\n\nIn 2020, TSMC developed a 3nm silicon proof and EM simulation-based LC tank design to facilitate high-speed SerDes (serializer/deserializer) circuit design with various metal scheme options and layout specifications with shortened design turnaround time. 2020 marked the first year that the end-users began enjoying the benefit of high speed, low latency and massive IoT in the 5G network roadmap.

Long-term Equity Investment Policy and Results\n\nTSMC's long-term equity investments accounted for using equity method were all made for strategic purposes. In 2020, the gains from these investments amounted to NT$3,592,818 thousand on a consolidated basis, increasing from the previous year mainly due to increases in product demand and the mass production of new products. In the future, TSMC's long-term equity investments accounted for using equity method will continue to focus on strategic purposes through prudent assessments.\n\n## 6.3 Risk Management\n\nThe Board of Directors plays a key role in helping the Company identify and manage economic risks. The risk management organization periodically briefs the Audit Committee on the ever-changing risk environment facing TSMC, the key points of the Company's enterprise risk management, and risk assessment and mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee's Chairperson also reports to the Board of Directors on the risk environment and risk mitigation actions to be taken.\n\nTSMC and its subsidiaries are committed to proactively and cost effectively integrating and managing strategic, operational, financial and hazardous risks that represent potential negative consequences to operations and financial results. TSMC operates an enterprise risk management (ERM) program based on both its corporate vision and its long-term, sustainable responsibility to both industry and society. ERM seeks to provide the appropriate management of risks on behalf of all stakeholders. The Company maintains a risk map that assesses likelihood and impact severity of risk events on the Company's operation, and is used to identify and prioritize risk controls and implement various controls and treatment strategies in response to risks as they are identified.\n\n## Scope of Risk Management\n\n## Strategic Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Regulatory change and compliance\n- \u25cf  Government policies\n- \u25cf  Changes in technology and industry\n- \u25cf  Technology development and competition\n- \u25cf  Demand and capacity expansion\n\n## Operational Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Sales and purchasing concentration\n- \u25cf  Information security\n- \u25cf  Intellectual property rights\n- \u25cf  Recruitment of qualified personnel\n- \u25cf  Corporate image\n\n## Financial Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Interest rate, foreign exchange, inflation, deflation and taxation\n- \u25cf  External financing\n- \u25cf  High-risk and/or highly leveraged investments; financial derivative transactions\n- \u25cf  Strategic investments\n\n## Hazardous Events\n\n- \u25cf  Earthquakes and natural hazards\n- \u25cf  Fire or chemical spills\n- \u25cf  Climate change\n- \u25cf  Utility supply\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework\n\n## Risk Identification and Assessment\n\n- \u25cf RM Steering Committee and Audit Committee review and approve implementation of risk management strategy and prioritization of risk controls\n- \u25cf RM Executive Council adopts risk map which assesses likelihood and impact of risk events on operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Control and Mitigation\n\n- \u25cf Cross-function risk communication to determine cost-effective risk controls\n- \u25cf RM Executive Council is responsible for risk control implementation\n- \u25cf Risk controls implementation reviewed in annual control self-assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Response\n\n- \u25cf Crisis management and response plans\n- \u25cf Scenario-based crisis response drills\n- \u25cf Business continuity plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Monitoring and Reporting\n\n- \u25cf Risk management organization reports to RM Steering Committee and Audit Committee on the focus of enterprise risk management, risk assessment, and mitigation efforts\n\nTo mitigate the operational impacts of crisis events, ERM conducts pre-crisis risk assessment and identifies feasible strategies for crisis prevention.

To raise risk awareness and strengthen risk management culture in TSMC, RM task forces have been formed to enhance risk assessment and conduct crisis response exercises for potential critical events such as fire, earthquake, IT service disruption, IT security breach, supply chain disruption, major yield loss, and utility supply disruption. In order to continuously mitigate corporate risks, crisis response exercises are used to test the integrity of ERM and effectiveness of risk controls.\n\nTo mitigate supply chain disruption risks, TSMC has created a task force comprised of members from fab operations, materials management, risk management and quality systems management to work with suppliers to develop business continuity plans and enhance supply chain resilience. Partly as a result of these efforts, there were no interruptions in TSMC's supply chain in 2020.\n\nAs production capacity continues to expand with more advanced technology, TSMC has initiated and implemented seismic protection engineering design, risk treatment practices and green manufacturing projects during the design phase of all new fabs.\n\n## 6.3.1 Risk Management Organization Chart\n\nTSMC's risk management organization reports annually to the Audit Committee on the risk environment TSMC faces, the key points of enterprise risk management, and risk assessment and mitigation efforts.

Variations in order levels from customers may result in volatility in the Company's revenue and earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant, and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC's services. If TSMC cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company's revenue, margin, and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.\n\n## \u25cf  Changes in Technology\n\nThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and on manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or the Company's competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. In addition, TSMC's customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors).\n\nAlso, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies also impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. For example, in January 2019, the Company discovered yield problems in 12-nanometer and 16-nanometer wafers caused by a batch of photoresist, which resulted in delayed delivery of products and had a negative effect on TSMC's gross margin and operating margin in the first quarter of 2019. To reduce future risks of such incidences, the Company has since strengthened inline wafer inspection and tightened control of incoming material to deal with the increasing complexity of leading-edge technologies. If TSMC is unable to innovate new technologies that meet the demand of its customers or overcome the above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly.\n\nRegarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on pages 15-17 of this annual report.\n\n## Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling Price\n\nA vast majority of the Company's revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC products in smartphones, high performance computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), automotive electronics, and digital consumer electronics (DCE). Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services,\n\nincluding TSMC products and services, could adversely affect the Company's revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the historical and current trend of declining average selling prices (or 'ASP') of end use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. If the ASP of end use applications continues decreasing, the pricing pressure on components produced by TSMC may lead to a reduction of its revenue, margin and earnings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Competition\n\nThe markets for TSMC's foundry services are highly competitive. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. For example, Chinese companies are expected to be key players for new semiconductor fab development and fab equipment spending in part due to various incentives provided by the Chinese government.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC's customer base, or its ASP, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with these new and aggressive competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers to these new contenders.\n\n## Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory Environment\n\nTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign government policies and regulations that might impact its business and financial condition. During 2020 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no government policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC's operations or financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## 6.3.3 Operational Risks\n\n## Risks Associated with Capacity Expansion\n\nTSMC performs long-term market demand forecast for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on market demand forecasts, TSMC has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services. Currently, TSMC's capacity expansion plans include installing and increasing production capacity, mainly for 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer nodes, expanding its production facilities in the Southern Taiwan Science Park and building a 300mm wafer fab in Arizona.\n\nImplementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.\n\nIn addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC's market demand forecast may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if subsequent demand increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.\n\n## Risks Associated with Sales Concentration\n\nOver the years, TSMC's customer profile and the nature of the Company's customers' business have changed dramatically. While the Company generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC's ten largest customers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 accounted for approximately 68%, 71% and 74% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's largest customer in 2018, 2019 and 2020 accounted for approximately 22%, 23% and 25% of the Company's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's second largest customer\n\nfor each particular year accounted for less than 10% of its net revenue in 2018, 14% and 12% of its net revenue in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nA more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC's revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company's large customers and cause different seasonal patterns of the Company's business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices. There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm.\n\nAlso, TSMC has seen the changes of nature in the Company's customers' business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend toward the system companies developing their own designs and working directly with semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market. Also, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of TSMC's customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC's major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company's customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions such as export control directed at TSMC's major customers could impact the Company's ability to supply products to those customers, reduce those customers' demand for TSMC's products and services and impact their business operations. The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company's top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, or change in its major customers' business models may adversely affect TSMC's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration \u25cf  Raw Materials\n\nTSMC's production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in\n\noccasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company's needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC's revenue and earnings could decline if the Company is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources. In addition, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities to Taiwan from higher-cost areas.\n\nGiven that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production process. For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class materials. To streamline supply chain risk management, the Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company has established a supply chain risk assessment to ensure critical suppliers meet standards in labor, ethics, ESH (Environmental, Safety and Health) and BCP (Business Continuity Plan). Onsite audits are conducted regularly to empower these suppliers to take responsibility for their supply chain as any regulatory violations or adverse environmental impact event, or failure to meet sustainability requirements could result in business reduction or termination.\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment\n\nThe Company's operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain an appropriate amount of\n\nequipment and related services from a limited number of suppliers in a market that is characterized from time to time by limited supply and long delivery cycles. During such times, supplier-specific or industry-wide lead times for delivery can be as long as six months or more. To better manage its supply chain, the Company has implemented various business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to shorten the procurement lead time. Further, growing complexities, especially in advanced lithographic technologies, may delay the timely availability of the equipment and parts needed to exploit time-sensitive business opportunities and also increase the market price for such equipment and parts. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions or protectionist measures could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, including as a result of necessary export licenses being delayed or denied, additional export control measures, and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely manner to fulfill its customers' demand on technology and production capacity, or at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Associated with IT Security\n\nEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, it cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as its manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks by any third party attempting to gain unauthorized access to its internal network systems, to sabotage its operations and goodwill or otherwise. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC's systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, the Company cannot guarantee that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. Hackers behind these cyberattacks may also attempt to steal TSMC trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of its customers and other stakeholders and personal information of its employees.\n\nMalicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC's network systems to disrupt our operations, blackmail the Company to regain control of our computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC",

TSMC has implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. These measures include advanced virus scanning tools to prevent a fab from installing virus-infected tools, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, and the installation of anti-virus and advanced malware detection solutions across our computer devices. In addition, TSMC has deployed secure PCs and laptops, developed a public cloud security policy, introduced new technology for data protection, and improved email phishing detection. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, and it regularly perform employee awareness testing and conduct external security risk assessments. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company's cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.\n\nIn addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for the Company and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. Despite that the Company requires the third-party service providers to comply with the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will strictly fulfill such obligations, or at all. The on-site network systems of and the off-site cloud computing networks such as servers maintained by such service providers and/or its contractors are also subject to risks associated with cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or control of its or its service providers' computing systems, the Company's commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected as a result.\n\nRisks Associated with Intellectual Property Rights The Company's ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, TSMC may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose TSMC to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.\n\nTSMC has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC's technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations in foreign jurisdictions, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC's cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the Company's expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C. jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be\n\nsufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.\n\nIf TSMC fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.\n\nTSMC has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against the Company. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.\n\nRisks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious Matters As is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, we have received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, TSMC could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. TSMC is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC's business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject TSMC to potential significant legal liability.\n\nCurrently, TSMC's material legal proceedings are as follows:\n\nOn September 28, 2017, TSMC was contacted by the European Commission (the 'Commission'), which asked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales.\n\nWe cooperated continuously with the Commission to provide the requested information and documents. The Commission subsequently decided to close the investigation in May 2020.\n\nOther than the matters described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.\n\nRisks Associated with Mergers and Acquisitions In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC did not conduct any merger or acquisition.\n\nRisks Associated with Recruiting Quality Personnel TSMC relies on the continued services and contributions of its management team skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company's business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, illegal talent poaching, or related changes in market demand for its products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment, TSMC encourages job rotation and implements on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can learn and enhance their work efficiency in the actual work field. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire top-notch talents from Taiwan and overseas. TSMC recruits diversified and various special professional talents, and at the same time strengthen industry-academic cooperation. Grasp outstanding talents earlier can help TSMC recruit them in the future.\n\nFuture R&D Plans and Expected R&D Spending For additional details, see '5.2.7 Future R&D Plans' on page 86-87 of this annual report.\n\n## Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on Company's Crisis Management\n\nTSMC has established an excellent corporate reputation around the world based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company's positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to social responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in the economic, environmental and social dimensions of CSR.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for achievements in operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, corporate sustainability and other fields. These included: the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2020 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards' Most Prestigious Sustainability Award, Platinum Medal For Sustainability Report, Sustainable Water Management Award, Climate Leader Award, and Supply Chain Management Award; First Place in CommonWealth Magazine's Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Large-Cap companies; ranked top 5% in the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation; member of Fortune Magazine's 2020 World's Most Admired Companies and the 2020 Global 500; the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau's Green Factory Label and Energy Conservation Benchmark Award; the R.O.C. Environmental Protection Administration's Enterprise Green Procurement Award; Membership in the Corporate Knights 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2020; ranked No.1 in the 2020 Carbon Clean 200 list by Corporate Knights and As You Sow; Membership in the Wall Street Journal's 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies; and named Most Impactful Pioneer in the 2020 RE100 Leadership Awards. In addition, TSMC was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the 20 th consecutive year.\n\nTSMC adheres to its vision of uplifting society, and applies technology and innovation to help humanity overcome many challenges. As TSMC strives to excel in corporate social responsibility, the Company also encourages employees to make innovative breakthroughs in how they think about things and do things, as well as nurture their empathy and broaden their horizons. In 2020, the Corporate Social Responsibility Executive Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, held the first 'TSMC CSR AWARD,' taking tangible action to encourage all employees to propose ideas for sustainability in the five strategic directions of corporate social responsibility, including green manufacturing, building a responsible supply chain, creating an inclusive workplace, talent development, and caring for the underprivileged. The award further motivates TSMC colleagues to think innovatively about their work, implement corporate social responsibility, and build further on the Company's positive corporate reputation.\n\nWith its global reputation in mind, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, information security, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental\n\nevents, and utility supply disruption. TSMC sets crisis response and recovery measures according to possible crisis events and maintains a 'TSMC crisis command center control instruction' as well as a 'TSMC emergency response procedure' to establish its emergency response command structure. TSMC also holds regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis response procedures are comprehensive.\n\nTSMC holds regular monthly meetings of the Environment, Safety and Health Committee, which coordinates relevant departments in each fab to conduct regular emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders in crisis management, with the public relations department serving as the designated gateway for external communications.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, all departments immediately deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment, company property and manufacturing operations. Responders also alert the public relations department at the earliest stages of response to ensure timely, clear and consistent communication regarding the situation.\n\nRisks Associated with Change in Management During 2020 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.\n\n## 6.3.4 Financial Risks\n\n## Economic Risks\n\n## \u25cf Interest Rate Fluctuation\n\nTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe objective of TSMC's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in securities with investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC's cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating-rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC's fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive\n\nincome, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.\n\nTSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate futures to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments. However, these hedges can offset only a small portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nAll of the Company's short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than expected. The majority of its long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.\n\nCertain of TSMC's fixed income investments and short-term debt are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is expected to be replaced by other benchmark rates after 2021. TSMC cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, or whether such a transition might cause a reduction in its interest income and/or an increase in its interest expense.\n\n## \u25cf Foreign Exchange Volatility\n\nSubstantially all of TSMC's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros, and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company's revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company's operating margin based on its 2020 results.\n\nConversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC's customers and for TSMC's goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company's revenue.\n\nTSMC uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT-dollar-\n\ndenominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.\n\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's common shares and the market price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and of any cash dividends paid in NT dollar on TSMC's common shares represented by ADSs.\n\n## \u25cf Inflation\n\nIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, inflation had no material impact on TSMC's operations, or the business operations of its customers and suppliers.\n\n## \u25cf  Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax Laws\n\nAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.\n\nWhile the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC's principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this jurisdiction could increase TSMC's effective tax rate and have an adverse effect on its operating results.\n\nIn order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.\n\n## Risks Associated with External Financing\n\nIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.",

        "page_content": "Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative Transactions In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments.\n\nIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC has provided guarantees to TSMC Global, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its issuances of US dollar-denominated senior unsecured bonds in amounts not to exceed US$7.5 billion in total. Among which, US$3 billion senior unsecured bonds were already issued in September 2020. Since 2014, TSMC has provided a guarantee of no more than US$83.21 million to TSMC North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its obligation to an office leasing contract. Since 2020, TSMC Japan Limited has provided a guarantee of no more than JPY1,320 million to TSMC Design Technology Japan, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its obligation to an office leasing contract.\n\nAs of February 28, 2021, there were RMB 4.8 billion outstanding intercompany loans between TSMC's subsidiaries, and US$3.1 billion outstanding intercompany loans between TSMC and its subsidiary. All intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.\n\nAll derivative financial transactions entered in 2020 by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. For more transaction information and risk assessment, please refer to Note 7, Note 10, and Note 32 of the annual report section (II), Financial Statements.\n\nTo manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the Taiwan Securities and Futures Bureau. TSMC's policies and procedures include 'Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,' 'Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,' 'Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,' and 'Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee'.\n\n## Risks Associated with Impairment Charges\n\nUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC\n\nis not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income.\n\nThe determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company's operating results are otherwise already depressed. See 'Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY' in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.\n\n## 6.3.5  Hazardous Risks and Utility Supply Interruption or Shortage Risks\n\nThe frequency and severity of disruptive events, including damaging earthquakes, other natural disasters and severe weather, have been increasing in part due to climate change or systemic regional geological changes. TSMC has manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and droughts that may cause interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water and electricity, which in turn could disrupt operations. For example, in 2021, Taiwan has faced one of the worst droughts in decades. Government restrictions on supply and usage of water by industrial companies such as TSMC in response to such severe weather events could also disrupt our operations. In addition, TSMC's suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, most of TSMC's production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers and customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in Taiwan and Japan, areas susceptible to earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, and droughts from time to time that may cause shortages in electricity or water, or interruptions to the Company's operations.\n\nThus, if one or more natural disasters that result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC's operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion or fire, it could reduce the Company's manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse and material impact on its operational and financial performance.\n\nTSMC has occasionally suffered power outages or surges in Taiwan caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier, the Taiwan Power Company, or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have resulted in interruptions to TSMC operations. Such shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the government, which intends to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country by 2025. If the Company is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs within Taiwan, its ability to fill customers' orders would be severely jeopardized.\n\nIf such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC's operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.\n\nFuture expansions of TSMC's operations in the R.O.C. could be limited by shortages in water and electricity, and the limited availability of commercial-use land.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect TSMC business and results of operations in several ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the operations of TSMC's supply chains for equipment, parts and materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower arrangements for tool installation; (2) significant fluctuation in TSMC customers' demands for certain products, leading to uncertainties for TSMC's capacity planning and also for meeting customers' demand, which may harm TSMC's business with customers and subject TSMC to risks of legal disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC's products due to forced factory or office closures or partial operation.\n\nThe Company has implemented various measures to address the abovementioned risks, including but not limited to, health management of TSMC's employees, management of production inventory, supply chain risk management, and capacity management for demand changes. TSMC has formed an 'Epidemic Prevention Committee' to identify, implement and monitor such actions as required by the dynamic exigencies arising from the pandemic. As of the date of this annual report, TSMC's current business and results of operations have not been materially affected by the pandemic, partially due to such trends as work-from-home and distance learning emerged to help accelerate the digital transformation. However, there is no certainty that the measures the Company has taken will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, and TSMC's ability to perform critical functions\n\nand to meet customers' needs could be materially adversely affected.\n\nTSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to the safety of people, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management system) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management system). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.\n\nTSMC has further strengthened its business continuity plans, which include periodic risk assessment, risk mitigation, and implementation through the establishment of emergency taskforces when necessary, combined with the preparation of a thorough analysis of an emergency, its impact, alternative actions, and solutions for each possible scenario together with appropriate precautionary and/or recovery measures. Each taskforce is given the responsibility of ensuring TSMC's ability to minimize personal injury, business disruption and financial impact under the circumstances. TSMC periodically reviews its business continuity plans and revise it according to exercise results and implementation.\n\nIn response to the impact of the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan, TSMC continued to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have also been integrated into new fab design. TSMC business continuity procedures were further enhanced through the compliance with ISO 22301.\n\nTSMC and many of its suppliers use combustible and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although the Company maintains many overlapping risk prevention and protection systems, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC's risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of the Company's potential losses. If any of TSMC's fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion,",

        "page_content": "fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the Company's manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and as a negative impact on TSMC's financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, the Company has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.\n\n6.3.6  Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting Business\n\nBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC's products require the use of metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide.\n\nThe Company's failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, and its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:\n\n- \u25cf  significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third-party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;\n- \u25cf  unfavorable in alterations in TSMC's manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;\n- \u25cf  challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;\n- \u25cf  restrictions on TSMC's operations or sales;\n- \u25cf  loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and\n- \u25cf  damages to TSMC's goodwill and reputation.\n\nComplying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as obtaining substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company's operations.\n\nTSMC's inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC's operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed responding to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nTSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be controlled to improve competitiveness. For TSMC's climate change related risks and control measures, see the Climate Change and Energy Management section under '7.2.1 Environmental Protection' on page 131-132 of this annual report.\n\n## 6.3.7 Other Risks\n\nPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of\n\nSignificant Numbers of Shares by TSMC's Directors, and/or Major Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC's Total Outstanding Shares The value of TSMC shareholders' investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.\n\nAs of the date of this annual report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC's total outstanding shares.\n\n## Risks of Trade Policies\n\nAs TSMC's revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on page 15-17 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC's operating results. TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.\n\nIn May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, 'Huawei'), including an expanded license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract impacts of another country's actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational's compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.\n\nAs of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.\n\nTSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.\n\n## Other Material Risks\n\nIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC's management was not aware of any other risk that could have a potentially material impact on the financial status of the Company.",

        "page_content": "## 7.1 Overview\n\nThe Company's four core values of integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust remain as the core values of TSMC's culture. As the world's leading semiconductor foundry and a trusted technology and capacity provider, TSMC seeks, in addition to continued success in its business endeavors, to fulfill its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) management. For TSMC these responsibilities fall into three primary missions: acting with integrity, strengthening environmental protection and caring for the disadvantaged. For each of these missions the Company has established concrete, measurable long-term goals, as well as corresponding action plans to review and correct periodically, consistently creating value for all stakeholders.\n\n## Guidance for the Implementation of ESG\n\nTSMC's 'ESG Policy' is the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development. The 'ESG Matrix' set by the Company's founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of TSMC's ESG responsibility. The horizontal axis shows the seven areas where TSMC strives to demonstrate its ESG commitment: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work/life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. On the vertical axis are actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these responsibilities.\n\n## TSMC ESG Matrix\n\n| Society TSMC                                                   | Morality   | Business Ethics   | Economy   | Rule of Law   | Sustainability   | Work/Life  Balance  Happiness   | Philanthropy   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Integrity                                                      | V          | V                 |           |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Law Compliance                                                 |            |                   |           | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Anti-Corruption  Anti-Bribery  Anti-Cronyism                   | V          | V                 |           | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Environmental Protection  Climate Control  Energy Conservation |            |                   |           | V             | V                |                                 |                |\n| Corporate Governance                                           |            | V                 | V         | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Provide Well-Paying Jobs                                       |            |                   | V         |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| Good Shareholder Return                                        |            |                   | V         |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Employees' Work-Life Balance                                   |            |                   |           |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| Encourage Innovation                                           |            | V                 | V         |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Good Work Environment                                          |            |                   |           |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| TSMC Charity Foundation                                        |            |                   |           |               | V                | V                               | V              |\n| TSMC Education and Culture Foundation                          |            |                   |           |               | V                | V                               | V              |\n\n## ESG Management\n\nIn compliance with the vision and missions of TSMC's ESG Policy, the ESG Steering Committee serves as the highest-level ESG decision-making center within the Company and is committed to aligning TSMC more closely with international sustainability trends. TSMC's Chairman chairs the ESG Steering Committee, and the Chairperson of the ESG Committee serves as Executive Secretary. Together with senior executives from a wide variety of functions, they survey the Company's core operating capabilities, set the medium- to long-term strategic direction for ESG, and draft the blueprint to link the Company's core competencies with the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n\nThe Company's ESG Committee serves as a cross-departmental communication platform. Through quarterly meetings and issue-based discussions by cross-organizational teams, the committee members jointly set the Company's ESG strategies, identify key issues for the year, draft ESG-related budgets for their organizations and coordinate resource deployment, as well as plan and carry out annual projects. The Committee pursues sustainability objectives of interest to all stakeholders and ensures ESG strategies are implemented effectively in the Company's daily operations.\n\nThe Chairperson of the ESG Committee reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on implementation results and the work planned in the future. In 2020, TSMC focused on strengthening renewable energy adoption, driving in-house reuse rate of resources to realize circular economics, applying circular economy, and launching the TSMC Urban Greenery Project. To build a sustainable supply chain, the Company implemented a signed supplier code of conduct, performed supplier risk assessments and launched Supply Online 360, a Global responsible supply chain management platform, to extend TSMC's high operational standards. The Company also created an inclusive workplace by piloting a 'Psychological Safety' program to enable open communication and develop semiconductor talent and support through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education. To have a positive social impact, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the TSMC Charity Foundation also actively support and promote youth development, culture and art, and care for the disadvantaged.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nTSMC respects all stakeholder rights. To understand the level of interest in sustainability issues, TSMC uses multiple systematic channels to communicate with stakeholders, including the 'Contact Us' section of the corporate website, the ESG website and the ESG mailbox, the Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, as well as the new Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel, established in 2020. TSMC has conducted three studies focused on identification, prioritization and validation with regard to these issues.\n\nIn 2020, the TSMC ESG mailbox received 445 valid emails on subjects ranging from corporate governance, innovation and services, to supply chain management, green manufacturing, inclusive workplace, and social investments. Submissions were primarily regarding requests for inquiries on operations, proposals for donations and collaborations, opinion and feedback from the public and visits. TSMC responded through direct action from related departments and timely replies from the public relations department, supporting communication with the public as well as positive development in society.\n\n## Stakeholders and Communication Channels in 2020\n\n| Stakeholders           | Communication Channels

The Company's ESH policies aim to achieve 'zero incident' and 'environmental sustainability' and to make TSMC a world-class organization in environmental, safety and health management. The Company's strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related corporate social responsibilities.\n\nAll TSMC manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001: 2015 certification for environmental management systems and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety and health management systems. All fabs in Taiwan have been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified since 2009. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the latest version of ISO 45001: 2018 to replace OHSAS 18001 in March 2018. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001: 2018 certification in August 2019. All TSMC subsidiaries obtained certification in 2020.\n\nTSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, fire and explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage, so as to reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks.\n\nIn order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management (HSPM) System. All TSMC manufacturing facilities have been QC 080000 certified since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with international regulatory and customer requirements, including the European Union's 'Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive,' the EU's 'Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),' the 'Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,' the 'halogen-free in electronic products' initiative, Perfluorooctane Sulfonates (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and its related substances restriction standards.\n\nIn addition, TSMC started a project for reducing usage of hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) in 2016. NMP unit product usage has been reduced 59% by 2020 comparing to 2016, and the project will continue promoting for further reduction.\n\nSince 2011, TSMC has adopted the ISO 50001 Energy Management System for the continuous improvement in energy conservation. In 2019, all TSMC fabs in Taiwan received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification, and all TSMC overseas subsidiaries scheduled to receive the certification in 2019 have had their certifications postponed to 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by managers at the vice president level. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.\n\nTo mitigate the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counseling.\n\nTSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The promotion of self-management aims at improving sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure the Company's safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.\n\nTSMC collaborates with suppliers to improve the sustainability of the Company's supply chain regarding ESH-related issues, such as environmental protection, compliance of safety and hygiene codes, hazardous substance management, fire protection, and mitigation of natural disaster. The Company not only performs ESH audits at its suppliers' manufacturing sites, but also proactively assists them to improve ESH performance.\n\nIn addition, TSMC monitors potential climate-change related risks in the supply chain. The Company requests that suppliers conduct carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste.\n\nIn recent years, TSMC suppliers have made excellent progress in procedure establishment and implementation for pollution control and safety management. To take it a step further, the Company has given greater attention to occupational hygiene issues directly related to labor health. In 2017, TSMC and the Ministry of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) jointly launched the 'Semiconductor Supply Chain Safety and Health Promotion Project'. TSMC also invited suppliers to participate in the project. As engaged by OSHA, a professional team has taken on the responsibility of providing consultation through document review and onsite inspection to participating suppliers on management procedures and hardware setup in order to improve the working environment and labor health management.\n\n## 7.2.1 Environmental Protection\n\n## Climate Change and Energy Management\n\n## \u25cf  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nGiven that climate change could potentially affect operations and pose financial risk, in 2018 TSMC adopted recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risk and opportunities, and further established metrics and target management based on the identification results.\n\n## Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risk and Opportunity\n\n| Category            | Management Strategy and Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance          | Board of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risk and opportunity \u25cf  ESG Steering Committee led by Chairman is the Company's top organization that deals with climate change management.

Management\n\nTSMC actively participates in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) in its efforts to establish a global voluntary PFC (perfluorinated compounds) emissions reduction goal for the decade of 2011 to 2020, and has incorporated past experience to develop best practices. The implementation of best practices has been adopted by the WSC as a major element of the 2020 goal. In 2013, in accordance with the 'EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction' regulation, TSMC applied for the recognition of greenhouse gas reduction from 2005 to 2011, and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company's sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.\n\nSince 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for TSMC's strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC participated the international organization 'Carbon Disclosure Program, CDP' to publicly disclose climate change related information every year. In 2020, TSMC was recognized by CDP as A- and A leadership level for climate change and water security respectively.\n\nIn response to the commitment of global climate summit 'Paris Agreement' and the Republic of China's 'Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act' promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for corporate carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, carbon emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, TSMC also sets short, medium and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by senior vice presidents which are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC's GHG emissions\n\ncome from electricity consumption, TSMC always emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency of its facilities during operation. These efforts simultaneously reduce both carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. TSMC has accumulated 1.7 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) power conservation since 2016.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the Republic of China Ministry of Economic Affairs' green power purchasing program for three consecutive years and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with renewable energy suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy for the Company, TSMC is first committed to achieving a target of 25% renewable energy for fabs and 100% renewable energy for non-fab facilities by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2020 again. TSMC also used carbon credits to offset Carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emission for TSMC global offices. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC established a renewable energy task force and continued to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. The Company made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration could speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The recommendations included expanding the development of offshore wind power and increasing supply of renewable energy trading platform. TSMC also continued to find renewable energy. By the end of 2020, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 1.3GW (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after related business process being completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company's active support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nTSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100 (Global Renewable Energy Initiative) in July 2020 and pledged that power consumption of all the Company's manufacturing plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050. TSMC was further awarded the first RE100 Leadership Award - the Most Impactful Pioneer in September\n\n2020 for being the first to purchase large amounts of renewable electricity in Taiwan and taking practical action to support green energy.\n\n## Air and Water Pollution Control\n\nThe Company has installed effective air and water pollution control equipment in each wafer fab to meet regulatory emissions standards. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment around the clock and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.\n\nTo make the most effective use of Taiwan's limited water resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation rates by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing equipment and improving wastewater reclamation systems. All fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water, outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world. TSMC also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturingrelated water consumption, including water used in air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and landscaping activities and kitchens. TSMC uses an intranet website to collect and measure water recycling volumes company-wide.\n\nSince water resources are inherently local, TSMC shares its water saving experiences with other semiconductor companies through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to promote water conservation in order to achieve the Science Park's goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and demand. In addition, TSMC has committed to using partially reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future in order to further reuse water resources and support government policy and promotion for reclaimed water.\n\nTo continue enhancing water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the AWS Standard, the world's only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2019, Fab 6 and Fab 14 Phase 5/6/7 began serving as demonstration factories and received AWS certification by the end of the year, making TSMC the first semiconductor enterprise to receive AWS platinum level certification in the world. In 2020, Fab 15A and Fab 15B, located in Central Taiwan Science Park, passed third party verification audit and obtained AWS platinum level certification simultaneously.",

        "page_content": "## Waste Management and Recycling\n\nThe Company has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. To meet the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC's priorities are: process waste reduction, onsite regeneration and reuse, and offsite recycling. The last option consists of treatment or disposal. To achieve raw material reduction, resource recycling and the goal of zero waste, for example, the Company built an in-house waste sulfuric acid pre-treatment system, as electronic grade sulfuric acid can be used as a waste water treatment agent after the wafer fabrication process. In order to track waste flow and ensure that all waste is treated or recycled legally and properly, TSMC carefully selects waste disposal and recycling contractors. All recycling contractors must report their recycled product sales monthly. The Company performs regular onsite audits to check factory status and review the reported data with actual reuse and recycling data to assure that the recycled product is flowing downstream properly. TSMC checks their licenses and on-site operational statuses, and also takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing effectiveness. For example, all waste transportation contractors have been asked and agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. In addition, all waste recycling and treatment vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. Meanwhile, TSMC also conducts an ongoing survey of recycled product tracking, actions taken to ensure lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.\n\nIn 2020, TSMC's fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the sixth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the eleventh consecutive year. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. TSMC also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced from processing activities into products to be used onsite or to sell to other factories. In 2020, the Company not only achieved zero outsourcing treatment of copper-containing liquid waste and cobalt-containing liquid waste, and zero purchasing of 50% concentration industrial-grade sulfuric acid but also extended its ammonium sulfate drying system, which converts biologically toxic ammonia wastewater into industrial grade ammonium sulfate as valuable recycled products for sale. As a result, TSMC has become a leader in waste resources regeneration.\n\n## Environmental Accounting\n\nThe purpose of TSMC's environmental accounting system is to identify and calculate environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company can also evaluate the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to promote economically-effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue growing, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC's environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company's economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for reduction of energy, water or waste and benefits from waste recycling in accordance with its environmental protection programs.\n\nThe environmental benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling and savings from major environmental projects.

        "page_content": "## 7.2.3 Safety and Health\n\n## Safety and Health Management\n\nTSMC's safety and health management is compliant with local and international standards and adheres to the management approach of 'Plan, Do, Check, Act' to prevent accidents, promote employee safety and health, and protect Company assets. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, collection and planning of internal and external issues, expectation and demand of stakeholders, evaluation of risk inspection, communication and consultation of non-managers, application of performance indicator, and evaluation of corrective and preventive action. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to find safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020.\n\nBesides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that potential risk in the operation of production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.\n\nFor epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n## Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health Protection\n\nThe Company's ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee's\n\nawareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building an ESH culture. TSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment Safety and Health Management\n\nIn addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.\n\nTSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate 300mm front-opening unified pod (FOUP) transportation to prevent accumulative physical damage caused by repetitive manual handling of 300mm FOUPs. TSMC 300mm fabs have completed automatic transportation control.\n\n## \u25cf  Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical Substances\n\nAs a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to ensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor industry's safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that new chemicals' environmental, safety and health concerns can be well controlled, including engineering controls, application of personal protection equipment, and operational safety training during storage, transportation, usage and disposal.\n\n## \u25cf  General Safety Management, Training and Audit\n\nAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize damage to employees and property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.\n\n## \u25cf  Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management\n\nTSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also educates and requires employees to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.\n\nThe Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO 2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC has performed exposure assessments and has used hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health effect for employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the exposure to acceptable levels.\n\n## \u25cf  Health Promotion Program\n\nIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to execute health promotion programs covering three key areas:\n\n- (1)  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.\n- (2)   Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before working or providing any services there.\n- (3)  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant health risks: inform suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in supplier's safety data sheet (SDS).\n\n## \u25cf  Emergency Response\n\nThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response should identify potential high-risk events via risk assessment and be prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvement and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC's emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for all potential incidents.\n\nAll TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC's onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills. In 2019, the Company completed 108 scenarios to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took lead in the industry to introduce the 'All-Hazard' approach recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of October 2020, 75 sessions of tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 195 full-scale exercises.\n\nIn addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company's laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.\n\n## \u25cf Emerging Infectious Disease Response\n\nTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC's (Centers for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company's strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for",

The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact.\n\n## \u25cf Employee Physical and Mental Health Enhancement\n\nTSMC believes that employees' physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining normal business operations but is also part of a corporation's responsibility. To protect and promote employee physical and mental health, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular disease that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts maternal health protection programs and prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness and related activities, which not only protect employees from hazards at work but also proactively promote employee health in general. In 2020, through planned personal health management, (1) 599 female employees participated in the maternal health program, the completion rate was 100%. 598 of them were at the first degree risk (there was no harm to the mother, infant, and baby). One employee was classified as second degree risk (possible harm to the mother, infant, and baby) at the first assessment; after proper adjustments to her works, she was reclassified as the first degree after doctor's re-assessment. (2) By analyzing historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of our employees, TSMC modified disease assessment criteria with contracted doctors, and, combining internal annual health examination reports, as well as working hour's information, was able to identify 2,678 employees that have middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, along with their managers, they received suggested working hour recommendations to reduce disease risk. (3) 174 employees were identified in a high risk group for cumulative trauma disorders. Among them, one could have job-related risks. The Company has adjusted whose job conditions to avoid possible risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor of diabetes, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2020, considering the prevention of COVID-19 and the tendency of young generation's preference on social and video media, TSMC conducted a\n\nseries of on-line interactive activities, such as (1) 2 sessions of 'Health Lecture On-line', 809 attendees in total. (2) 3 health education videos about hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, with a total of 7,266 visits. (3) 3 sessions of on-line quiz, with respect to 3 topics of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, with a total of 4,618 attendees. (4) 1 session of 'Selection of Health Diet' of DASH diet, 1,019 participants. The feedbacks were positive to make health promotion can be continued under epidemic prevention.\n\n## 7.2.4 Supplier Management\n\n## Management Aspect\n\nFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in environmental protection, safety and health. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly-defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities must obtain ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.\n\n## Supply Chain Sustainability\n\nTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster.\n\nSince becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.\n\nTo enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan's\n\nenvironmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier's code of conduct, which affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety, environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers' performance of sustainability through experience sharing and training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.\n\nTSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the OECD's Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas issued in 2011.\n\nTSMC is a strong supporter of the Responsible Business Alliance and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which will help the Company's suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose information and make timely updates on smelters and mines. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a 'conflict free' designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RBA) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with Responsible Minerals Initiative or an equivalent third party audit program. TSMC requires the use of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products that are conflict-free.\n\nTSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements. For further information, see the Company's Form SD filed with the U.S. SEC. (https://www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/sec\\_ filings.htm)\n\n## 7.3 TSMC Education and Culture Foundation\n\nIn 2020 , the world was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in March, many venues in Taiwan were shut down and the impact of the pandemic could be felt in every sector. In times like these, it behoves the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation to be the first to donate a hundred thermographic cameras to the Ministry of Education to be deployed at national examination locations to support education and safeguard the health of students with the power of technology. Although various programs planned by the Foundation were curtailed by COVID-prevention measures, in 2020 the Foundation invested over NT$99 million to support various educational events, art exhibitions and performances. Through continuous donations, the Foundation hopes to help reduce educational inequality and bring new ideas to the table for cultural enrichment.\n\nWorking in Tandem with Educational Partners, Closing the Resource Gap between City and Country Apart from donating one hundred thermographic cameras to the Ministry of Education as part of the COVID-prevention measures on campus in Taiwan, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation works with its educational partners to reduce inequality in educational resources. Together the Foundation and its partner Junyi Academy worked to develop a series of online courses of adaptive learning titled 'Critical Thinking Training,' which was a response to the implementation of General Guidelines of Curriculum Guidelines of 12-Year Basic Education. In addition, the program hosted 26 teaching workshops where teachers learned how to guide students to think logically and improve their communication skills. 518 teachers have attended the workshops and more than 120,000 people have watched them online.\n\nAs well as providing online educational resources to teachers and students, the Foundation has long been committed to narrowing the gap of educational resources between schools in urban and rural areas. In 2020, it partnered with Cheng Zhi Education Foundation to assist Emei Junior High School of Hsinchu county to transition to be a KIST-inspired school. With the injection of new educational blood, the two foundations have helped change the lives of many students from schools in rural areas. The Foundation also continuously teams up with CommonWealth Education Foundation, Teach for Taiwan, and the Boyo Social Welfare Foundation. Together the",

        "page_content": "Foundation donates quality books and brings good teachers to schools in rural areas to narrow the educational gap between urban and rural areas. Furthermore, in 2020 the Foundation offered grants to 70 students from low-income families at five universities: National Tsing Hua University, National Central University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, and National Chung Cheng University. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to assist the students with financial aid and encourage them to concentrate on their studies.\n\n## Nurturing Young Talent, Offering a Stage for Diverse Development\n\nTo promote popular science education and nurture talents for the semiconductor industry, in 1997 TSMC subsidized the 'World of Semiconductors' exhibition hall at the National Museum of Natural Science, being at the vanguard of business-supported education of popular science. For the exhibition to keep up with the times, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation updated the content of the exhibition in 2002 and again in 2011. In 2018, the Foundation initiated a third renewal project and a brand new 'World of Semiconductors' was officially launched in August 2020. With the latest upgrade the exhibition hall provides more in-depth knowledge on semiconductors, adds interactive exhibitions, and increases the exhibition space. Through a multi-dimensional experience at the exhibition, visiting students and the public can broaden their knowledge of semiconductors and the industry. In the meanwhile, in order to inspire more female students to take interest in science, in 2020 the Foundation organized for the first time a 'Trip of TSMC Women Scientists,' inviting students from five girls' high schools to visit the exhibition and be given guided tours by women engineers at TSMC. These women engineers have shared with the young students the trajectory of their learning and precious work experience, thereby hoping to encourage girls at high schools not to confine themselves to any subjects and commit themselves to fields in sciences through in-person exchange.\n\nTo motivate college students to pursue their dreams and encourage young people to commit to environmental sustainability, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation organized the fifth 'TSMC Youth Dream Building Project' in 2020. It focuses on the theme of 'circular economy' as way to advocate the importance of environmental sustainability\n\nto the public and to the younger generation. This project was open not only to the college students in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Maoli and Tainan areas but also to those from Taichung area. In total, 102 teams of college students participated in the project. The topics of the proposals covered virtually every issue in society, ranging from creating a popular science column on semiconductors, to a wood reclaiming project, and from an anti-drug campaign to food and agriculture education. These innovative ideas greatly impressed the panel of judges. Moreover, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation continued its support for literary, calligraphic and seal-carving by young students through funding two annual competitions, i.e. the 'TSMC Youth Literature Award' and the 'TSMC Youth Calligraphy and Seal-Carving Competition,' which are well into their 17th and 13th years respectively. Both competitions have become the important events in their respective fields. The Foundation has also attracted public attention and interest in literature and calligraphy via the internet. The 'TSMC Youth Literature Award' social platform so far has garnered over 14,000 members and one award-winning piece has been shared over 3,000 times.\n\nThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation wishes to offer a non-academic platform to young students, where through science and humanities competitions and events the students can be inspired to develop diverse interests and explore wherever their passion takes them.\n\n## Advocating Online Arts and Literary Events, Calming the Restless Mind\n\nDuring the second half of 2020, the pandemic situation in Taiwan was relatively under control. Thus, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation was able to sponsor a live concert in Tainan performed by the renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma and streamed it live globally. With pandemic preventive measures in place, the Foundation invited the public to the concert hall to experience the soul-soothing power of virtuoso performance. At the same time, live streaming allowed audiences all over the world to enjoy the musical feast. The Foundation also teamed up with the National Symphony Orchestra (of Taiwan) to initiate an 'Education Program for Youth' project, inviting Taiwanese-Australian violinist Ray Chen to give master classes at the National Concert Hall. The classes were streamed live and broadcasted by Taiwan Public Television Service, thereby promoting music education to a wider audience. Over 73,000 people have viewed the master classes.\n\nThe Foundation has long dedicated itself to promoting Chinese classic literature. In 2020, it collaborated with National Tsing Hua University on a general education course, 'Pai Hsien-yung Literature Lectures: Dream of the Red Chamber'. The course hosted by Mr. Pai Hsien-yung and renowned Honglou meng specialists from abroad and in Taiwan to give lectures on various aspects of the classic. The course also invited students to explore the profoundness of Chinese literature, bringing a humanistic perspective to their education. Likewise, the Foundation-funded broadcasting program, 'Lectures on the Classics on Air,' entered its 13th year. The program host, Professor Xin Yi Yun, has released an audio book, Putting A Xin's Spin on Lao Tzu, as an approachable way for the public to experience the wisdom of Chinese philosophers from the classics. In the same vein, the 2020 'TSMC Lecture' again invited the distinguished research fellow Wang Ming-ke of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica to examine how humans have coped with fear and what measures have been taken historically to deal with pandemics. The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has not only promoted literary talks within local communities but also posted the talks on an online channel available to the public. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to go beyond geographic borders with technology and let arts and literature comfort the restless minds during these difficult times.\n\n## 7.4 TSMC Charity Foundation\n\nSince its establishment in 2017, the TSMC Charity Foundation has focused on developing programs and projects relating to its four main pillar initiatives: disadvantaged care, solitary elderly care, filial piety promotion, and environmental protection. Under the leadership of Chairperson Sophie Chang, the Foundation takes a stand for disadvantaged persons, focusing on current and potential social issues, and striving to close the wealth gap in Taiwan society by enhancing education and providing emergency assistance in rural areas. This support gives disadvantaged families and children from rural areas more opportunities to improve their lives. The Foundation has also established a social welfare platform that magnifies voices from all corners of society to support social change, powers social change through charitable works, and uplift Taiwan society.\n\nThe Foundation continued to expand its scope of services through charitable endeavors in 2020 and initiated many new projects related to social welfare including the following:\n\n- \u25cf  Disadvantaged Care: The Foundation focused on the two main initiatives for disadvantaged care -'rural education' and 'support for the disadvantaged'. The Foundation provided volunteer services, building repairs, online educational materials, off-grade foods, and other assistance to educational institutions and children in rural areas, ensuring that disadvantaged groups received equal opportunities to obtain education. In 2020, the Foundation prioritized vocational education, collaborating with various enterprises to promote training and reach the goal of 'providing livelihood/practical skills,' helping students from rural areas with vocational training. To help support the basic living needs of the underprivileged, the Foundation continued to visit and provide financial aid and daily supplies to high-risk disadvantaged families, providing valuable support to the already existing social welfare system.\n\nIn 2020, the Foundation gave support to 62 after-school care locations benefiting a total of 4,685 students. With the dedication and knowledge of its TSMC volunteers, the Foundation created science tutorial videos to promote science experiments and education. The Foundation also collaborated with National Chiao Tung University to help 30 elementary schools in Hsinchu City that were lacking information resources to align with 2019 Curriculum Guidelines, an issue affecting 18,000 students in the city. The Foundation's 'Sending Love' programs continued to be active, and Foundation staff conducted onsite visits to identify disadvantaged families in need of financial support. The living conditions of these disadvantaged families were improved through charitable donations from both inside and outside TSMC. As of 2020, the Foundation has assisted a total of 155 families.\n\n- \u25cf  Solitary Elderly Care: The Foundation improved the health and welfare of solitary elders by collaborating with its Networking of Love partners to connect social welfare groups and medical institutions providing care to solitary elders. In 2020, the Foundation helped launch a new intelligent medical system at the Taitung County Sazasa Aborigine Health Promotion Site to enhance medical quality and efficacy. The Foundation continued to collaborate with TSMC Facility Division to provide house repair services at seven locations in Eastern Taiwan, ensuring a safe and healthy living space for solitary elders. Current Networking of Love partners include Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Miaoli General Hospital, Old Five Old Foundation, Feng Yuan Hospital,",

In 2020, volunteers from TSMC Fabs and Divisions helped promote filial piety awareness by teaching elementary and junior high school students to make lunchboxes and write autobiographies, thereby building a bridge for communication between generations. The Foundation continues to work with the K-12 Education Administration Ministry of Education, hosting four parent-child filial piety workshops in New Taipei City, Taichung, Yunlin, and Tainan to encourage cross-generational dialogue and plant the spirit of filial piety in the hearts of the attendees.\n- \u25cf  Environmental Protection: We aim to reduce food waste through the Cherish Food Program. Through our volunteer programs, we promote environmental awareness, help schools improve energy savings inside their facilities, and also educate and provide information to these schools about environmental protection.\n\nIn 2020, the Foundation continued its 'Cherish Food Program' and worked with many food companies to donate off-grade foods and 11 freezers to 92 institutes that collaborated with the Foundation to provide care for the disadvantaged, reduce food waste, and promote environmental conservation. The Foundation previously collaborated with food companies including Chi Mei Frozen Food, Hunya Foods, Laurel Corporation, Lian Hwa Foods Corporation, Hsin Tung Yang Corporation, and Dachan Great Wall Group.\n\nTSMC ecology volunteers continued to provide ecology tours at Hsinchu Fab 12B plant, Taichung Fab 15 plant, Tainan Fab 14 plant, and the Tainan Jacana Ecology Education Park; meanwhile, TSMC professional energy-saving volunteers helped educational institutions of all levels with making energy-saving assessments and improvements, at service locations covering Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung.\n\n## 7.5 TSMC i-Charity\n\nLaunched in 2014, the TSMC i-Charity platform is an internal interactive website that TSMC employees can use to propose care programs, share program results, provide responses and suggestions, and take advantage of timely online funding activities to give back to society.\n\nIn 2020, charitable contributions surpassed NT$32 million and a total of 22,000 people participated in the 'Equal Education Platform,' 'Teach for Taiwan,' 'Repair Services Volunteer Group Program,' and 'Pandemic Prevention Support for Firstline Workers' initiatives.\n\nFrom 2014 until 2020, charitable contributions on the TSMC i-Charity platform has in aggregate, exceeded NT$140 million. TSMC will continue its commitment to society and encourage employees to care for and give back to society in different ways.\n\n## 7.6  Social Responsibility Implementation Status as Required by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission\n\n| Assessment Item                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Implementation Status   | Implementation Status   | Implementation Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Non- implementation   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes                     | No                      | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | and Its Reason(s)     |\n| 1.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\n## The basis for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.\n\n- 17 -",

        "page_content": "All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nChanges in the Company's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control  over  the  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  as  equity  transactions.  The  carrying  amounts  of  the Company's interests and the non -controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the parent.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between:\n\n- a. the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and\n- b. the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.\n\nThe Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.\n\n## The subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe detail information of the subsidiaries at the end of reporting period was as follows:\n\nEstablishment\n\nPercentage of Ownership\n\n| Name of Investor   | Name of Investee                                | Main Businesses and Products                                                                                                                                 | and Operating  Location          | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | Note   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| TSMC               | TSMC North America                              | Selling and marketing of integrated  circuits and other semiconductor  devices                                                                               | San Jose, California,  U.S.A.    | 100%                | 100%                | -      |\n|                    | TSMC Europe B.V.

The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  operating  results  and  financial  positions  of  each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit  or  loss  in  the  year  in  which  they  arise.  Non-monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  that  are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period.  Assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  classified  as  current  are  noncurrent  assets  and  liabilities, respectively.\n\n- 19 -",

        "page_content": "## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined  at  the  time  of  initial  recognition.  Regular  way  purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## 2)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\n- 20 -",

        "page_content": "Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and accumulated in other equity.\n\nDividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the Company 's right to receive the dividends is established , unless the Company's right s clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.\n\n## 4)  Measured at amortized cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits are measured at amortized cost.\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.\n\n## b. Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding  adjustment  to  their  carrying  amount  through  a  loss  allowance  account,  except  for investments  in  debt  instruments  that  are  measured  at  FVTOCI,  for  which  the  loss  allowance  is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\n## c. Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an invest ment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n\n- 21 -",

Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## a. Fair value hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company's fixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instrument that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n- 22 -",

Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents  the  estimated  selling  price  of  inventories  less  all  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive incom e of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other  investors,  the  proportionate  amount  of  the  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  in  other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\n- 23 -",

Costs  include  any  incremental  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  construction  or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  in  the  course  of  construction for production, supply or administrative purposes  are  carried  at  cost,  less  any  recognized  impairment  loss.  Such  assets  are  classified  to  the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation  of  these  assets,  on  the  same  basis  as  other  identical  categories  of  property,  plant  and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\nDepreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases)  -  5  years;  and  office  equipment  -  5  years.  The  estimated  useful  lives,  residual  values  and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date,  plus  an  estimate  of  costs  needed  to  restore  the  underlying  assets.  Subsequent  measurement  is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\n- 24 -",

Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rates.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are\n\n- 23 -",

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Guarantee Deposit\n\nGuarantee deposit mainly consists of cash received under deposit agreements with customers to ensure they have access to the Company's specified capacity. Cash received from customers is recorded as guarantee deposit upon receipt. Guarantee deposits are refunded to customers when terms and conditions set forth in the deposit agreements have been satisfied.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations.\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\n- 24 -",

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provision.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  tax  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  except  when  they  relate  to  items  that  are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n- 27 -",

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  JUDGMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION  AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn the application of the aforementioned Company's accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n## Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive  to  exercise  or  not  to  exercise  an  option,  including  any  expected  changes  in  facts  and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include  contractual  terms  and  conditions  covered  by  the  optional  periods,  and  the  importance  of  the underlying asset to the lessee's operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n- 28 -",

The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value.    The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\n\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn determining a lessee's incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market riskfree rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.\n\nOn the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets will change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.\n\nThe main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses.\n\nThe following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risk.\n\n## December 31, 2020\n\nContract Amount\n\n| Hedging Instruments                                  | Contract Amount  (US$ in Thousands)   | Maturity                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate futures contracts - US Treasury  bonds | US$88,700                             | March 2021                                           |\n| Hedged Items                                         | Asset Carrying Amount                 | Accumulated Amount of  Fair Value Hedge  Adjustments |\n| Financial assets at FVTOCI                           | $  6,198,683                          | $  1,122                                             |\n\n- 32 -",

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward exchange contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.\n\nOn the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward exchange contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty's  own  credit  risk  on  the  fair  value  of  forward  exchange  contracts.  No  other  sources  of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to Note 22(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items.\n\nThe following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges for foreign currency risk.\n\n## December 31, 2019\n\n| Hedging Instruments        | Contract Amount  (In Thousands)   | Maturity     | Balance in  Other Equity  (Continuing  Hedges)   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Forward exchange contracts | Sell NT$ 1,342,392                | January 2020 | $  (3,820)                                       |\n\n- 33 -",

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n\nIn principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the  end  of  the  month  when  the  invoice  is  issued.  Aside  from  recognizing  impairment  loss  for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers' financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.\n\n## Aging analysis of notes and accounts receivable\n\nDecember 31,\n\nDecember 31,\n\n|                         | 2020           | 2019           |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Not past due            | $  140,933,622 | $  126,134,762 |\n| Past due                |                |                |\n| Past due within 30 days | 4,784,425      | 13,082,080     |\n| Past due 31-60 days     | 8,708          | 12,794         |\n| Past due 61-120 days    | 48             | 1,033          |\n| Past due over 121 days  | 95             | 3,245          |\n| Less: Loss allowance    | (246,626)      | (325,325)      |\n|                         | $  145,480,272 | $  138,908,589 |\n\n- 34 -",

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\n- a. Defined contribution plans\n\nThe plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the 'Act') is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly  salary  to  employees'  pension  accounts.  Furthermore,  TSMC  North  America,  TSMC  China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Europe, TSMC Canada and TSMC Technology also make monthly contributions at  certain  percentages  of  the  basic  salary  of  their  employees.  Accordingly,  the  Company  recognized expenses of NT$2,809,484 thousand and NT$2,609,733 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nTSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds  (the  Funds),  which  are  administered  by  the  Labor  Pension  Fund  Supervisory  Committee  (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government's designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\nYears Ended December 31\n\n|                                                                                                                                  | 2020       | 2019                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|\n| Current service cost                                                                                                             | $  123,311 | $  135,645             |\n| Net interest expense                                                                                                             | 81,604     | 123,951                |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss                                                                 | 204,915    | 259,596                |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:  Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense) | (139,212)  | (124,344)  (Continued) |\n\n- 43 -",

Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC's Board of Directors and reported to TSMC's shareholders in its meeting.\n\nTSMC's amended Articles of Incorporation provide that, when allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC's paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the TSMC's Articles of Incorporation.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\nThe reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.\n\nPursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside additional special capital reserve equivalent  to  the  net  debit  balance  of  the  other  components  of  stockholders'  equity,  such  as  the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation reserve, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to\n\n- 47 -",

Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by Audit Committees and/or Board of Directors in accordance  with  procedures  required  by  relevant  regulations  or  internal  controls.  During  the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is denominated in U.S. dollar and over one-half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Euro. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate  risks  associated  with  non-NT  dollar-denominated  assets  and  liabilities  and  certain  forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of  10% would have decreased its net income by NT$897,722 thousand and NT$2,137,338 thousand, respectively, and decreased its other comprehensive income NT$107,690 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floatingrate  securities  carry  a  degree  of  interest  rate  risk.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  fixed  income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rate fall, cash\n\n- 59 -",

        "page_content": "and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate futures to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments. However, these hedges can offset only a small portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's fixed income investments at the end of the reporting  period, interest  rates  increase  of  100  basis  points  (1.00%)  across  all  maturities  would  have decreased the fair value by NT$3,143,569 thousand and NT$3,517,424 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decreases were composed of NT$3,143,569 thousand decrease  and  NT$3,516,604  thousand  decrease  in  other  comprehensive  income  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and NT$820 thousand decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nThe majority of the Company's short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than predicted. The majority of the Company's long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$446,470 thousand and NT$401,879 thousand, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial  losses  to  the  Company.  The  Company  is  exposed  to  credit  risks  from  operating  activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's ten largest customers accounted for 79% of accounts receivable  in  both  years.  The  Company  considers  the  concentration  of  credit  risk  for  the  remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n\nThe objective of the Company's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve  principal  and  support  liquidity  requirements.  The  policy  generally  requires  securities  to  be\n\n- 60 -",

The changes are mainly due to investment portfolio adjustment and changes in credit rating of investment securities.\n\n## e. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, fixed income investments at FVTPL, financial assets at FVTOCIcurrent, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Company's  financial  liabilities  based  on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.\n\n|                                                  | Less Than    1 Year   | 1-3 Years   | 3-5 Years   | More Than    5 Years   | Total         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| December 31, 2020                                |                       |             |             |                        |               |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities             |                       |             |             |                        |               |\n| Short-term loans                                 | $  88,557,526         | $  -        | $  -        | $  -                   | $  88,557,526 |\n| Accounts payable (including related  parties)    | 41,095,002            | -           | -           | -                      | 41,095,002    |\n| Payables to contractors and  equipment suppliers | 157,804,961           | -           | -           | -                      | 157,804,961   |\n| Accrued expenses and other current  liabilities  | 71,995,747            | -           | -           | -                      | 71,995,747    |\n| Bonds payable                                    | 5,327,971             | 27,631,589  | 59,986,812  | 207,152,135            | 300,098,507   |\n| Long-term bank loans                             | 8,000                 | 847,389     | 1,170,944   | -                      | 2,026,333     |\n|                                                  |                       |             |             |                        | (Continued)   |\n\n- 61 -",

On December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability by 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$39,006 thousand and NT34,843 thousand if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.\n\nFor the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.\n\nIn addition, the fair values of convertible bonds are determined by the present value of future cash flow based on a discount rate reflecting issue r's credit spread and market conditions, combined with the  fair  value  of  conversion  option  estimated  by  the  option  pricing  model  considering  recent financing activities of the investee and market transaction prices of the similar companies.\n\n- 67 -",

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aforementioned other financial assets amounted to NT$135,375 thousand and NT$114,467 thousand, respectively.\n\n## 35.  SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS\n\nSignificant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:\n\n- a.  Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee approved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC's capacity provided TSMC's outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of December 31, 2020, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.\n- b. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Si ngapore. TSMC's equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased  all  the  SSMC  shares  owned  by  EDB  Investments  Pte  Ltd.  pro  rata  according  to  the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own  approximately  39%  and  61%  of  the  SSMC  shares,  respectively.  TSMC  and  NXP  B.V.  are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SS MC's capacity, but TSMC alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required  to  compensate  SSMC  for  all  related  unavoidable  costs.  There  was  no  default  from  the aforementioned commitment as of December 31, 2020.\n- c. On September 28, 2017, TSMC was contacted by the European Commission (the 'Commission'), which asked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales. We cooperated continuously with the Commission to provide the requested information and documents. The Commission subsequently decided to close the investigation in May 2020.\n- d.  TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies with multiple suppliers. The relative minimum purchase quantity and price are specified in the agreements.\n- e. TSMC entered into a long-term purchase agreement of equipment. The relative purchase quantity and price are specified in the agreement.\n- f. TSMC  entered  into  long-term  energy  purchase  agreements  with  multiple  suppliers.  The  relative purchase period, quantity and price are specified in the agreements.\n- g.  Amounts available under unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were NT$56,194 thousand and NT$59,976 thousand, respectively.\n\n- 71 -",

We also:\n\n- 1.  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the parent company only financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. C onclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ab ility to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors ' report to the related disclosures in the parent company only financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors ' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the parent company only financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  parent  company  only  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6.  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the parent company only financial statements. We are  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  group  audit.  We  remain  solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the parent company only financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors ' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n- 115 -",

The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes the evaluation.\n\n## 4.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFor  the  convenience  of  readers,  the  accompanying  parent  company  only  financial  statements  have  been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language parent company only financial statements shall prevail.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers (the 'Accounting Standards Used in Preparation of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements').\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nWhen preparing the parent company only financial statements, the Company account for subsidiaries and associates by using the equity method. In order to agree with the amount of net income, other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the parent in the consolidated financial statements, the differences of the accounting treatment between the parent company only basis and the consolidated basis are  adjusted  under  the  heading  of  investments  accounted  for  using  equity  method,  share  of  profits  of subsidiaries and associates and share of other comprehensive income of subsidiaries and associates in the parent company only financial statements.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nIn preparing the parent company only financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.  At the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  monetary  items  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign\n\n- 13 -",

        "page_content": "currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting parent company only financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting  period.  Income  and  expense  items  are  translated  at  the  average  exchange  rates  for  the  period. Exchange differences arising, if any,  are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent  assets  are  assets  held  for  trading  purposes  and  assets  expected  to  be  converted  to  cash,  sold  or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  values.  Transaction  costs  that  are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities,  as  appropriate,  on  initial  recognition.  Transaction  costs  directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe  classification  of  financial  assets  depends  on  the  nature  and  purpose  of  the  financial  assets  and  is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from\n\n- 14 -",

        "page_content": "remeasurement  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  The  net  gain  or  loss  recognized  in  profit  or  loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## 2)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss.  Other  changes  in  the  carrying  amount  of  these  debt  instruments  are  recognized  in  other comprehensive income and will  be reclassified  to profit  or loss  when these  debt  instruments  are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\nInvestments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity.\n\nDividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the Company's right to receive the dividends is established, unless the Company's rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.\n\n## 4)  Measured at amortized cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits are measured at amortized cost.\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.\n\nSubsequent  to  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost  are  measured  at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.\n\n## b. Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n- 15 -",

Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  transferred  directly  to  retained  earnings,  without recycling through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments\n\n## Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Company  derecognizes  financial  liabilities  when,  and  only  when,  the  Company's  obligations  are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- 16 -",

        "page_content": "## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents  the  estimated  selling  price  of  inventories  less  all  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method include investments in subsidiaries and associates.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in a subsidiary is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the subsidiary as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognized its share in the changes in the equity of subsidiaries.\n\nChang es in the Company's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the carrying amount of the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, any retained investment of the former subsidiary is measured at the fair value at that date. A gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and calculated as the difference between (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and (b) the previous carrying amount of the investments in such subsidiary. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the subsidiary had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\n- 129 -",

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these parent company only financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associ ate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the C ompany's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other  investors,  the  proportionate  amount  of  the  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  in  other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen the Company transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company' s parent company only financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.\n\n- 130 -",

Costs  include  any  incremental  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  construction  or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  in  the  course  of  construction for production, supply or administrative purposes  are  carried  at  cost,  less  any  recognized  impairment  loss.  Such  assets  are  classified  to  the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation  of  these  assets,  on  the  same  basis  as  other  identical  categories  of  property,  plant  and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\nDepreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date,  plus  an  estimate  of  costs  needed  to  restore  the  underlying  assets.  Subsequent  measurement  is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\n- 131 -",

        "page_content": "Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate s.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:    Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an  indication  that  the  cash  generating  unit  may  be  impaired.  For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit. If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the  difference  is  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  any  goodwill  allocated  to  such cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any  indication  that  those  assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs.  When  a  reasonable  and consistent  basis  of  allocation  can  be  identified,  corporate  assets  are  also  allocated  to  individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\n- 132 -",

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  or  cash-generating  unit  is  reduced  to  its  recoverable  amount.  An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Guarantee Deposit\n\nGuarantee deposit mainly consists of cash received under deposit agreements with customers to ensure they have access to the C ompany's specified capacity . Cash received from customers is recorded as guarantee deposit upon receipt. Guarantee deposits are refunded to customers when terms and conditions set forth in the deposit agreements have been satisfied.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations .\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns  and  other  allowances  is  generally  made  and  adjusted  based  on  historical  experience  and  the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\n- 133 -",

Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents t he actual deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provision.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the parent company only financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable  profit.  Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  generally  recognized  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  tax  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  except  when  they  relate  to  items  that  are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n- 134 -",

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  JUDGMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION  AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn the application of the aforementioned Company's accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n## Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from  the  commencement  date  until  the  exercise  date  of  the  option.  Main  factors  considered  include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee's operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n## Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\n\n## Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances\n\nSales  returns  and  other  allowance  is  estimated  and  recorded  based  on  historical  experience  and  in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n- 23 -",

Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn determining a lessee's incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

Defined contribution plans\n\nThe plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the 'Act') is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, the Company has made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly salary to  employees'  pension  accounts.  Accordingly,  the  Company  recognized  expenses  of  NT$2,309,527 thousand and NT$2,063,508 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement.  The  Company  contributes  an  amount  equal  to  2%  of  salaries  paid  each  month  to  their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government's designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                                               | Years Ended December 31   | Years Ended December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                               | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Current service cost                                                          | $  123,311                | $  135,645                |\n| Net interest expense                                                          | 81,604                    | 123,951                   |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss              | 204,915                   | 259,596                   |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:                           |                           |                           |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense)   | (139,212)                 | (124,344)                 |\n| Actuarial loss (gain) arising from experience adjustments                     | 494,051                   | (438,009)                 |\n| Actuarial gain arising from changes in demographic  assumptions               | -                         | (233,239)                 |\n| Actuarial loss arising from changes in financial assumptions                  | 3,161,910                 | 541,697                   |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other  comprehensive income | 3,516,749                 | (253,895)                 |\n| Total                                                                         | $  3,721,664              | $  5,701                  |\n\n- 37 -\n\nTotal Amount",

Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:\n\n- 1)  Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government's designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.\n- 2)  Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.\n- Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$694,732 thousand and NT$724,963 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n- 3)  Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.\n- Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$835,964 thousand and NT$706,502 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n- 39 -",

The capital surplus from share of changes in equities of subsidiaries and associates and dividend of a claim extinguished by a prescription may be used to offset a deficit; however, when generated from issuance of restricted shares for employees, such capital surplus may not be used for any purpose.\n\n## c. Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nThe amendments to the Company 's Articles of Incorporation had been approved by the Company 's shareholders in its meeting held on June 5, 2019, which stipulate that earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by the Company 's Board o f Directors and reported to the Company 's shareholders in its meeting.\n\nThe  Company 's  amended Articles  of  Incorporation  provide  that,  when  allocating  earnings,  the Company shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve  at  10%  of  the  remaining  earnings  (until  the  accumulated  legal  capital  reserve  equals  the Company 's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the Company 's Articles of Incorporation .\n\nThe Company 's Articles of Incorporation a lso provide that profits of the Company may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\nThe reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.\n\nPursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders' equity, such as the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation reserve, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders' equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.\n\n- 153 -",

        "page_content": "## b. Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by Audit Committees and/or Board of Directors in accordance  with  procedures  required  by  relevant  regulations  or  internal  controls.  During  the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is denominated in U.S. dollar and over one-half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Euro. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate  risks  associated  with  non-NT  dollar-denominated  assets  and  liabilities  and  certain  forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$832,231 thousand and NT$2,112,450 thousand, respectively, and decreased its other comprehensive income by NT$107,690 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its bank deposits and bank loans. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's bank deposits, as well as the interest paid on its bank loans. Because all of the Company's bonds issued are fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$73,464 thousand and NT$77,156 thousand, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and\n\n- 52 -",

        "page_content": "financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's ten largest customers accounted for 67% and 83% of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment-grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty.

The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of December 31, 2020, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.\n- b. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. The Company's equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, the Company and NXP B.V. purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, the Company and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. The Company and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC's capacity, but the Company alone is not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required  to  compensate  SSMC  for  all  related  unavoidable  costs.  There  was  no  default  from  the aforementioned commitment as of December 31, 2020.\n- c. On September 28, 2017, the Company was contacted by the European Commission (the 'Commission'), which asked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales.
