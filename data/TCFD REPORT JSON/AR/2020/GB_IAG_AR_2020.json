At a testing time, we took swift action to ensure we emerge from this unprecedented crisis well positioned to compete in a structurally changed industry. '\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic's impact on people, communities, companies and countries has been overwhelming.\n\nThe toll on our sector has been particularly heavy, with IATA estimating that global traffic will not reach 2019 levels until around 2024.\n\nIn 2020 IAG made an operating loss of \u20ac4,365 million before exceptional items on revenues of \u20ac7,868 million. This compares with an operating profit before exceptional items of \u20ac3,285 million in 2019. Passenger traffic and capacity reduced by 74.7 per cent and 66.5 per cent, respectively, with all our airlines making losses far exceeding those recorded in the 2001 crisis and the 2009 financial shock.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese results reflect the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, exacerbated by constant changes in government travel restrictions.\n\nWe acted swiftly to mitigate the pandemic's impact, bolster liquidity and protect our long-term future. We've made significant progress on restructuring, reducing our cost base and increasing the/uni00A0proportion of our variable costs, to ensure IAG not only weathers the present storm, but emerges from the crisis well positioned/uni00A0to compete in a structurally changed industry.\n\nMuch of that is down to our successful business model, bringing together a portfolio of world-class, market-leading brands coupled with a record of financial discipline that has seen us become one of the world's best performing airline groups in terms of financial returns.",

        "page_content": "Our record on growing profitability which increased six-fold between 2011 and 2019 - and Return on Invested Capital has underpinned our leadership position, as has our ability to create shareholder value, with \u20ac4.1 billion returned to investors between 2015 and 2019.\n\nAs the pandemic struck, we strengthened our financial and strategic position. In October we successfully completed a \u20ac2.74 billion capital increase which was fully subscribed by our shareholders. This positions us well for when demand eventually recovers.\n\nBrexit led us to implement plans approved by national regulators in Spain and Ireland to ensure our EU-licensed airlines continue to meet EU ownership and control rules. They include creating a national ownership structure for Aer Lingus and changes to IAG's longstanding Spanish structure.\n\nAlso, we changed the Board composition to create a majority of independent non-executive EU directors. I wish to thank Deborah Kerr, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda and Steve Gunning who stepped down from the Board for their valuable contribution to IAG. Steve's executive functions as Chief Financial Officer remain unchanged and I'm very grateful for his support for these/uni00A0changes.\n\nAlthough it was disappointing to take this step, we're pleased that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement recognises the potential benefits of further liberalisation of airline ownership and control as we believe it's in the best interests of the industry and consumers.\n\nThroughout the crisis we've stuck to our strategy, including playing a lead role in industry consolidation. Iberia amended its agreement to acquire Air Europa, subject to regulatory approvals. This will strengthen our Madrid hub's competitiveness, benefiting consumers and the Spanish economy.\n\nIt's critical our industry plays a full part in addressing climate change and we won't back down from our ambition to lead that effort. Having become the first airline group to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, last year we supported one world in making this pledge which involves 13 airlines representing a fifth of global aviation.\n\nWe've retired British Airways' Boeing 747 fleet and Iberia's Airbus A340s. We are investing in next-generation aircraft which are up to 40 per cent more efficient than those they replace.\n\n2020 also saw a transition in our leadership. Willie Walsh, originally scheduled to stand down as Chief Executive Officer in March, agreed to extend his tenure until September to help see IAG through the early months of the pandemic. I thank him for the skill and professionalism he brought right through to his last day.\n\nTogether we built IAG starting with the merger of British Airways and Iberia, and it/uni00A0was a joy to work side-by-side for ten years to develop IAG's unique business/uni00A0model.\n\nLuis Gallego took up the CEO role on September 8, having led Iberia's turnaround. He does so knowing the Board has complete confidence in his exceptional leadership skills.\n\nI served as Chairman for nearly ten years but decided to retire in January 2021 in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Javier Ferr\u00e1n has succeeded me, bringing vast experience to the role not just as a multinational executive, but also as a director and chairman of many top-tier companies. Our carefully developed succession plan has enabled a smooth and effective transition following the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\nI feel greatly honoured to have enjoyed the trust of my fellow directors and to have worked with so many tremendous colleagues across the business. I'm fully confident that IAG will meet the challenges/uni00A0ahead with its powerful new leadership team.\n\n## Antonio V\u00e1zquez\n\nFormer Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Q&A with the Chairman Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What attracted you to joining\n\nA: Ten years ago, IAG disrupted aviation by creating a successful business model which has delivered industry-leading returns. Its unique structure underpinned by the best European airline brands has seen it become one of the world's best performing airline groups pre-pandemic. This is testament to the fantastic work and innovative thinking of its employees. I'm particularly grateful for their commitment throughout this crisis and for their hard work to help the business navigate these testing times. IAG has shown an extraordinary ability to take advantage of market opportunities, maximise synergies and play a leading role in consolidation. The airline industry is truly fascinating, and the Group has demonstrated its agility to adapt and overcome challenges through this current difficult period. I'm extremely proud of being part of IAG.\n\n## Q:/uni00A0 the IAG Board?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA: IAG's Board members have vast experience, diverse backgrounds and deep knowledge of the corporate world. We started 2021 with the appointments of Peggy Bruzelius, Eva Castillo and Heather Ann McSharry who have extensive experience in top-tier companies across various industries. Diversity enables effective leadership and decision-making and is an essential part of our nomination processes. I'm pleased that 45 per cent of our Board\n\n## Q:/uni00A0 What's the strength of the IAG Board?\n\nmembers are women. It's a great honour to enjoy the trust of my fellow directors and chair IAG's Board in this challenging and fast-moving environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What changes will COVID-19's impact bring to the industry?\n\nA: The global impact of COVID-19 has been unprecedented. Aviation is going through a structural change and we are transforming our business to adjust it to a 'new normal'. Last year, we acted swiftly to strengthen liquidity and protect our long-term future by adapting to the new circumstances. Reducing our cost base and increasing the proportion of our variable costs will give us flexibility to compete and take advantage of a recovery in air travel demand. Customer needs are also rapidly changing. The industry must be ahead of the game in developing user-friendly digital solutions to provide the tools and reassurance passengers need to travel. Both innovation and technology are critical in driving efficiencies as we navigate our way out of the crisis and towards recovery.\n\nQ:/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What's critical for the long-term\n\nA: IAG has a proven and successful operating model with a great portfolio of market-leading brands. Its pre-COVID-19 track record on profitability, sustainable growth, return on invested capital and shareholder value creation provide a solid foundation for the Group's long-term success. In these extremely challenging times, we are demonstrating our resilience to overcome COVID-19's impact. Our\n\n## Q:/uni00A0 success of the business?\n\nfinancial discipline is crucial to our strategy and we've got a very experienced management team under Luis's leadership with significant expertise in business transformation. Over the long term, the critical drivers of success will be our culture and the talent of our employees; a culture that allows each individual to grow and give the best of themselves.\n\n## Q:/uni00A0 Sustainability is becoming even more critical and aviation is likely to change significantly in the coming years. Is IAG ready to adapt?\n\nA: For a decade, IAG has been leading the airline industry on sustainability. It was the first airline group worldwide to commit to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It's also investing US$400 million in sustainable aviation fuel in the next 20 years. IAG was an aviation pioneer in signing the United Nations Climate Ambition Alliance and one of the ten global companies recognised by the UN for their ambitious carbon targets. Despite the current crisis, we will not back down from our ambition to lead aviation's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. We're determined to play our full part in tackling climate change and support the long-term prosperity of the communities we serve.",

        "page_content": "## Securing our business, building for the future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' Our immediate focus in 2020 was navigating the deepest crisis in aviation history and then making sure our airlines emerge competitive in the future. Across the business, our people have made an incredible contribution to this effort. '\n\nIt is hard to exaggerate how severe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been on our industry. The disruption and financial damage it has caused airlines across the world has, quite simply, been/uni00A0unprecedented.\n\nWe've been through crises before, not least after 9/11 and the financial shock of 2008/9. 2020 will go down as the worst year in the history of aviation.\n\nNot surprisingly, our own airlines have felt the effects of this crisis very deeply. With overall capacity reduced by two-thirds, all of them recorded heavy losses and a steep revenue decline. Against that background, we reported a Group operating loss of \u20ac4,365 million before exceptional items. The contrast to 2019, where we recorded an operating profit before exceptional items of \u20ac3,285 million, could not be more/uni00A0stark.\n\nBut we believe that a crisis, even one as profound and unpredictable as the pandemic, always presents significant opportunities as well as challenges.\n\nIt is in this spirit that we have approached these extraordinary times, taking swift action to secure the business in the short term, while taking steps to transform our business so that it is more competitive in the future.\n\nBefore I detail the actions we have taken, I/uni00A0want to put on record my thanks to people right across the business who have/uni00A0played such a central role in all we have achieved.\n\nThe commitment, resilience and flexibility they have shown is really exceptional. They have had to adapt at high speed to new ways of working and all the difficulties that come with that. They have made big sacrifices in terms of salary and working time. We have been forced to reduce our workforce by 20 per cent to just under 58,000, with 75 per cent of all redundancies achieved voluntarily.\n\nAt British Airways, while the airline did everything it could to protect as many jobs as possible, we sadly saw the departure of over 10,000 employees as a result of the pandemic. We are very grateful for their contribution over the years to the airline's/uni00A0success.\n\nFinally, almost 50,000 employees have been on job retention schemes. These government initiatives, providing a valuable support for our staff and for the business, have been important in helping us navigate the crisis.\n\n## Managing the crisis\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic we were in a strong position as one of the best performing airline groups in our industry in terms of growing profitability.\n\nWe have had to take swift and decisive action to conserve cash and reduce our cost base. Additionally, where we can we are converting fixed costs to variable costs to more closely reflect levels of demand in the market.\n\nThat is not a simple task. In the airline industry, fixed costs are traditionally very high. As an example, we can change part of our fixed price for fleet maintenance to/uni00A0a so-called 'power-by-the-hour' arrangement.\n\nIdeally you want to match cost reductions to capacity. Our capacity decreased by 66.5 per cent during the year compared to 2019 and we cut our non-fuel costs by 37.1/uni00A0per cent, an extraordinary effort by all our airlines.\n\nLonger term, the crisis has taught us that we will need a higher degree of variability in our cost base in a much-changed world.\n\n## Boosting liquidity\n\nOur second priority was to improve liquidity. Again, we started in a strong position, with \u20ac6.7 billion in cash at the end of 2019, a resource strong enough to see us through the crises we have experienced in the past. But it very quickly became clear that we would need further resources and took a series of steps to boost our cash position. Our \u20ac2.7 billion successful rights issue in October was a tremendous vote of confidence from investors in the underlying strength of our/uni00A0business and our ability to manage the/uni00A0crisis.\n\nAmong our other activities, British Airways received commitments for a \u00a32.0 billion five-year loan facility, partly guaranteed by UK Export Finance along with a \u00a3300 million loan from the Bank of England. Also, we drew down additional debt of \u20ac1.01 billion for our Spanish airlines as part of the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) facility. These are all commercial loans, even if some are partially underwritten by/uni00A0governments.",

        "page_content": "## Transforming our brands\n\nDuring this crisis, we've also been thinking hard about the future.\n\nOur business model remains robust, but we recognise that customer expectations will change following the pandemic. With the rapid adoption of remote working technologies, it is likely the business travel market will also be different.\n\nTo think through these challenges, we have created a new Management Committee role, of Chief Transformation Officer, appointing Fernando Candela, Chief Executive Officer of LEVEL, to the position. He is leading our transformation projects to make us more competitive and efficient in future.\n\nI see this as a very important role. Before the COVID-19 pandemic we had a strategic roadmap for the Group. But the pandemic has accelerated many of the projects we had in mind, as well as creating new priorities.\n\nNowhere is that truer than with digital transformation, where many experts believe the crisis has sped up the process of digitalisation by up to five years. It impacts on all areas of the business. But it will be particularly crucial where customers are concerned, for instance in providing them with a contactless experience at airports and faster, better ways to interact with our airlines.\n\n## Working with suppliers\n\nOne of the great advantages of our business model is our ability to achieve synergies across the Group, and our Global Business Services operation has continued to play a vital role here.\n\nWe are working closely with all our suppliers to manage our way through the current environment, looking to achieve better terms and conditions because we know they face difficulties too.\n\nThe same applies in managing our fleet, and we are in talks with aircraft manufacturers to reschedule the delivery of new, more efficient aircraft over the coming years, matching capacity to demand.\n\nDuring the year, we retired the British Airways Boeing 747 fleet and Iberia's Airbus A340s early. We remain committed to bringing new aircraft technologies online, as the market allows. Refreshing our fleets with aircraft that are up to 40 per cent more efficient than the ones they replace will play an important role in our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a commitment that is as strong as/uni00A0ever.\n\n## Cargo revenues\n\nAs well as weathering the storm, we have also tried to help. We have carried out repatriation flights and transported vital equipment such as PPE, ventilators and COVID-19 test equipment.\n\nWe do not operate dedicated freighters any longer, and normally carry cargo in the holds of our passenger aircraft. But during the pandemic, we gained clearance to use the cabins for freight as well.\n\nIn all, we completed more than 4,000 cargo flights, something we are not used to, and our team deserves great credit for this effort. IAG Cargo increased its turnover by almost \u20ac200 million, during the year, to \u20ac1.3 billion.\n\n## Air Europa and further consolidation\n\nWe are pressing ahead with Iberia's acquisition of Air Europa, having renegotiated the original deal. The value of the transaction, originally set at \u20ac1 billion, has been reduced to \u20ac500 million, which will be paid after six years. This will allow the combined operation to repay a loan Air Europa has received from the Spanish Government and be in a strong position to compete once demand recovers.\n\nWe believe in Air Europa and think it is right to take brave decisions now for the future. The rationale behind the deal remains very strong. It will allow Madrid to compete against the other major European hubs, serving destinations around the world, rather than being primarily focused on Latin America.\n\nThe deal still needs approval from EU competition authorities. We also need to negotiate with the Spanish Government over certain non-financial conditions applying to the Air Europa loan. Given the huge benefits for consumers, Madrid and the wider Spanish economy, I'm confident we can reach an accord and hopefully the deal will be completed this year.\n\nIAG came into existence to speed up the consolidation of our industry and we've had great success to date. The pace of that will depend on how quickly airlines recover from this crisis. Some will struggle to repay debt and there are likely to be failures. We will be looking to see if there are further opportunities to develop the/uni00A0Group.\n\n## A new leadership team\n\nThe last year has seen a significant change in IAG's leadership. Willie Walsh was supposed to step down as CEO in March, but, with the pandemic escalating rapidly at that point, he agreed to stay on for a further six months to help us navigate the crisis. He made a phenomenal contribution during this time and we thank him greatly for the extraordinary job he has done to bring IAG to where it is today.\n\nI took up this post in September. But we have seen other important changes in the management team in 2020. Sean Doyle has moved across from Aer Lingus to become CEO of British Airways, after Alex Cruz stepped down. Javier S\u00e1nchez-Prieto has moved across from Vueling to become CEO at Iberia and is replaced at Vueling by Marco Sansavini, previously Iberia's chief commercial officer. Meanwhile, Donal Moriarty is acting as interim CEO at Aer Lingus.\n\nI feel honoured to lead such a capable group of colleagues, one that I believe can achieve great things in the years ahead. It is excellent that these appointments are internal. Many of the team were already on the Management Committee, know the decisions we have taken in the past and understand our unique business model, inside out.\n\nThey also share the values that are most important to me as a leader - commitment, loyalty, a spirit of embracing change and challenging the status quo, a belief in team work and a conviction that, although we have done well in the past, we can always do better.\n\n## Making it safe to fly\n\nPeople are still coming to terms with this dreadful virus and many worry if it is safe to fly. I can only assure you that it is. Safety is always the first priority in aviation.\n\nWe have put a huge effort into making sure our customers and our people remain safe, taking steps at every point of the journey. That has meant increased cleaning at all points of contact, new boarding procedures to maintain social distancing and insisting on face coverings on the ground and in the air. Our aircraft are fitted with air filters that are as powerful as those used in operating theatres. Cabin air, which flows from top to bottom, is refreshed every two to three minutes.\n\nLast autumn IATA calculated that there had been only 44 cases of COVID-19 linked to a flight journey out of a total of 1.2 billion travellers - the equivalent of one case in every 27 million passengers. These figures speak for themselves.\n\nWe are now trialling new mobile technology to make it easier for passengers to meet all the various travel requirements in different countries, such as providing proof of a negative COVID-19 test or vaccination.\n\nWe urge governments to introduce coordinated testing protocols, rather than relying on quarantine measures and further restrictions. In the end we all want the same thing - to prevent the spread of the virus, and to allow the travel sector and the wider economy to recover.\n\n## Outlook\n\nMy first Chief Executive Officer's review has been dominated by the effects of the pandemic. It has been an incredibly tough/uni00A0time.\n\nBut, as I look ahead, I am optimistic. I'm confident that we'll emerge well positioned to compete, with a greater appreciation of what we have.\n\nWhen I ask people what they have missed most in recent months, most say: 'I want to travel and see the world.'\n\nThat time will come. And when it does, I assure you we will be here to help.",

Firstly, we took action to preserve cash; secondly, we raised funding to improve liquidity; thirdly we reduced costs and additionally we have been converting fixed costs to variable costs. On the revenue side, we have operated 4,003 cargo only flights using passenger aircraft which was an important contributor to the Group. Finally, we have pressed for a common standard of testing across the world so that we can get passengers flying again soon.\n\n## Q:/uni00A0 Why do you think IAG will come out of the pandemic well positioned to compete?\n\nA: We were in a very good position before the pandemic, with all the airlines in the Group performing well in the preceding years. I/uni00A0firmly believe we have the right team and the right commitment to take us forward and, importantly, we are taking steps to transform the business that others are not taking. That should put us in a very good position to emerge more competitive even though it is undoubtedly the most severe crisis in the history of/uni00A0aviation.\n\n## Q:/uni00A0 How do you think governments can best support the re-opening of international travel?\n\nA: I think coordinated measures are key. We need to avoid quarantine and travel restrictions, replacing them with harmonised testing protocols. Now with the vaccines being rolled out, we need to develop technologies and apps to help people to travel more easily. This approach will allow passengers to use their phones to show that they have met local travel rules - whether that is applying for flight passes, filling in flight locator notifications, proving they have the required COVID-19 tests or have been vaccinated.\n\nQ:/uni00A0 Why is the Air Europa acquisition still worth doing? A: It is a strategic transaction for us. It will allow us to develop Madrid as a major and highly competitive international hub, with IAG at its centre. It will bring significant benefits to consumers, to Madrid and the wider Spanish economy. We have now renegotiated the deal at a reduced value of \u20ac500 million and/uni00A0on a deferred payment basis, allowing us to conserve cash as/uni00A0we recover from the current crisis and to be competitive when demand returns.\n\nQ:/uni00A0 What is your management style? A: Perhaps others can answer this question better than me! But I try to behave in the same way as I want the people in my/uni00A0team to behave. The values I think are key are commitment, willingness to embrace change, teamwork and loyalty. I am lucky to be working with a very skilled team of colleagues who share these values and who know and understand the strengths of our business model very well.",

        "page_content": "## Engaging with our stakeholders\n\n## Article 3.6 of IAG's Board of Directors regulations establishes:\n\nThe Board of Directors shall perform its/uni00A0duties with unity of purpose and independent judgement, giving the same treatment to all shareholders in the same position and being guided by the corporate interest, understood to be the achievement of a profitable and sustainable business in the long term, which promotes its continuity and the maximisation of the Company's value. In seeking to serve the corporate interest, in addition to respecting the applicable legislation and maintaining conduct based on good faith, ethics and respect for the generally accepted good practices and customs, the Board of Directors shall endeavour to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests, as applicable, of the/uni00A0employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders that might be affected, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the/uni00A0environment.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe commitment made in IAG's Board Regulations, in accordance with the Spanish corporate governance framework and equivalent to that of section 172 of the UK Companies Act, is clearly present in the work of IAG's Board of Directors. This section aims to describe how directors have applied and complied with these principles in the reporting year. Further details of how the directors' duties have been discharged are included in the Corporate Governance section.\n\nAlthough IAG has multiple stakeholder groups, the Board considers the most significant stakeholder groups to be customers, shareholders and other financial stakeholders, employees, suppliers, governments and regulators, and airline partners and industry associations. The relationship with all stakeholders is informed by the/uni00A0overarching need to ensure the sustainability of our business in all its different aspects, including the impact of/uni00A0our operations on the community and the/uni00A0environment.\n\n## Long-term vision, strategic/uni00A0priorities and key stakeholder groups\n\nIAG's vision is to be the world's leading airline group, maximising sustainable value/uni00A0creation for its shareholders and/uni00A0customers.\n\nThe first strategic priority for the Group is to strengthen its existing portfolio of world-class brands, particularly through ensuring that its well-regarded and complementary brands, which are each focused on delivering to a specific set of customer needs in their target demand spaces and geographies, are able to differentiate their product and service offering against their competitors. The employees across the Group play a fundamental part in delivering the unique identity and culture of each of our brands. It is also key to ensure the necessary cooperation and support from our suppliers to help develop and deliver such distinguising products and service. The Group is also dependent on the performance of key suppliers that provide services to our customers and the Group itself, such as airport operators, border control and caterers. In addition, the airlines' operations are dependent on the timely entry of aircraft and also on the necessary engine performance and reliability of our aircraft to improve operational efficiency and resilience. Aircraft and engine performance are also crucial to support the delivery of our Group sustainability programme, meaning close engagement with airline and engine manufacturers is key.\n\nThe second strategic priority for IAG is to grow its leadership positions, including through participating in the consolidation of the airline sector. For example, the proposed acquisition of Air Europa and the addition of Aer Lingus to the Group's Atlantic Joint Business with American Airlines and Finnair. Open competition and markets are in the long-term best interests of consumers. IAG is a strong proponent for continued deregulation and consolidation and we sustain our position with the support of and by engaging with relevant stakeholders such as industry associations, governments and regulators. With these stakeholder groups, we seek to mitigate the risk of excessive government intervention or changes to the regulations that can have a significant detrimental impact on operations.\n\nThe Group's third strategic priority is enhancing IAG's common platform, improving efficiency and focusing on digital and innovation. Our employees are enablers of change and we strive to create a working environment in which they can innovate to help deliver efficiency improvements and new ways of working. In addition, the realisation of these objectives needs to be built through cooperation and engagement with our key suppliers. Encouragingly, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, IAG witnessed robust and pragmatic discussions taking place with key suppliers over affording IAG flexibility with its supplier spend, as evidenced with aircraft manufacturers, who have supported the Group by agreeing to defer deliveries of new aircraft.\n\nAs part of the Group's vision, the focus on the sustainability of the business informs all its strategic priorities. In particular, the Group's commitment to play an active role in tackling climate change continues to be a priority. Engagement with all key stakeholders in this regard underpins the Group's future. During 2021, IAG will undertake a full-scale materiality assessment with all of its major stakeholder groups, which will include issues that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor more details please read 'Business model', 'Strategic priorities and key performance indicators', 'Risk management and principal risk factors' and 'Sustainability' sections.",

Consistent with this approach, IAG is responsible for the maintenance of relationships with shareholders, strategic suppliers and key financing counterparties.\n\nIn contrast, customer engagement is undertaken by the operating companies, ensuring a deep and realtime/uni00A0understanding of customers' needs/uni00A0and their cultural, social and economic environment.

Our diverse portfolio of brands gives us a leading position in meeting the specific requirements of customers across different demand spaces.\n\nAcross the Group, employees play a vital role in delivering the service experience that customers expect, whether on the ground or in the air. Our employees bring a diverse range of talent and perspectives that contribute to the values and culture of our companies. Creating an environment where employees feel motivated, safe and able to thrive and deliver for customers is central to the continued success of the/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe recognise the critical role that employees will play in the recovery and transformation of IAG and across the Group we are focusing on improving employee engagement.\n\nWe engage and listen to our customers through a range of customer satisfaction and market research surveys and focus groups. Their invaluable feedback is analysed by our expert customer insight teams and is used to drive product and service initiatives that will deliver the greatest value to the customer. Through our IAG Loyalty schemes we develop strong, long-term relationships with our customers. This helps us to deliver an experience tailored to individual customer needs and engage in a way that suits them. All IAG airlines have dedicated and highly-skilled customer relations teams, working around the clock to deliver the highest level of support and assistance to our customers. The customer relations teams are also responsible for resolving any customer complaints or claims, such as those covered under EC Regulation 261/2004. They engage with our customers across a range of channels, including our websites, call centres, social media accounts, e-mail and postal mail. In addition, our customers receive help and guidance throughout their journey from our renowned on-board and airport/uni00A0colleagues.\n\nEngagement with customers has been key during the year in understanding the changes in the needs and expectations of different customer types and to face the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This enabled the Group's airlines to adapt their customer journey by introducing a range of measures to support consumer confidence and to implement commercial reassurance measures for customers. All brands have changed their customer communications to provide clear guidance on the new airport and on-board procedures. Customer response to these and other reassurance measures has been very positive, as shown in the NPS result this year. For further information see 'Strategic priorities and key performance indicators' section.\n\nEach company in the Group has its own communication channels adapted to its culture and profile. In general terms, communication with employees is made using formal and informal channels which include: performance reviews, specific consultations, employee forums, internal social networks, local cascade meetings, newsletters, workshops, engagement surveys and Speak Up lines.\n\nIAG has a European Works Council (EWC) which brings together representatives from the different European Economic Area (EEA) countries in which the Group operates. EWC representatives are informed about and, where appropriate, consulted on transnational matters which may impact employees in two or more EEA countries.\n\nEngagement with employees has been challenging given the social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of the Group and therefore the workforce. The vast majority of employees were either furloughed for much of 2020 or working remotely from home, however, several surveys were completed during the year to adequately respond to changes in working practices and environments. Each company in the Group launched initiatives to support the wellbeing of their employees, their mental health and ensure COVID-19 safety. At the same time, IAG Tech has worked to enable employees across the Group to work in the most secure, efficient and effective manner.\n\nEmployee consultations have been undertaken as required and appropriate in relation to restructuring necessitated to adapt to a new business environment.\n\nthe/uni00A0workforce which/uni00A0is the direct responsibilitiy of each operating company.\n\nIn the case of governments and regulators, as well as with airline partners and industry associations, the leading role in such engagement is either at Group level or assumed by the operating companies depending on the impact and relevance of/uni00A0the particular stakeholder and the matters involved.\n\nFinally, our common integrated platform/uni00A0drives efficiency, simplicity and/uni00A0consistency in our approach to our/uni00A0suppliers.",

Shareholders and investors are main capital providers to both invest and grow the Group's business. Shareholders'/uni00A0and other financial stakeholders' views are critical in supporting the Group to formulate its strategy, as well as the operational and financial performance, to generate and optimise returns in a sustainable/uni00A0way.\n\nAdditionally, financial debt providers are key to support the operational and investment requirements of the Group in the short and long term. The access to adequate funding sources across different products and services enables the efficient management of the diverse funding requirements across the different geographies in which the Group operates.\n\nFinally, over half of IAG's fleet of aircraft is made up of aircraft on operating leases, which were either purchased by IAG and then sold and leased back from lessors or sourced directly from lessors. Strong relationships with our lessors are essential to allow for the smooth financing of new aircraft deliveries and to manage the aircraft during a typical 12-year operating lease. This has proved especially important in 2020 where IAG has been able to engage extensively/uni00A0with its leasing partners on new and/uni00A0existing leases.\n\nIAG actively and frequently communicates with shareholders and other financial stakeholders through an open and transparent dialogue so they can understand performance and also raise any possible concerns. IAG usually holds at least six formal meetings every year (Annual General Meeting, Capital Markets Day and four quarterly results briefings), where shareholders and investors have the opportunity to interact with management.The Company also attends numerous investor conferences throughout the year and organise roadshows around the world to meet investors with diverse perspectives and from different locations. Some of these include both management and Board members, and have a business focus as well as a corporate governance and ESG focus. Additionally, the Group Investor Relations team maintains an ongoing dialogue with equity research analysts, to understand investors' and shareholders' views of the/uni00A0Company.\n\nThrough the corporate website, annual reports and press activity IAG keeps shareholders informed of the development of the/uni00A0business.\n\nEngagement with debt and lease providers is done at IAG level to ensure strategic and consistent approach across the Group, with the support of the Fleet and Finance teams at the Group's airlines. IAG fosters a long-term relationship by actively and frequently engaging with the debt and lease providers across the different geographies and areas of expertise. The Group maintains an open and transparent dialogue, so they are familiar with its financial performance and long-term strategy, can understand the financial strategy and financing requirements. IAG outlines its financing priorities and expectations whilst they provide ideas, solutions and lending capabilities.\n\n2020 was the first year since its creation, that IAG did not hold its usual Capital Markets Day due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company provided more detailed and extended quarterly presentations, including a presentation focused on the capital increase completed in 2020 and at the second quarter results. The Group also continued to interact with investors in a very intensive manner, including investor calls, roadshows and conferences, with the format moving from physical events to virtual events. Finally, ESG continued being an area of focus and the Company launched an investor survey to the Top 100 shareholders in December to better understand their approach towards it.\n\nIn 2020, the Group focused on obtaining access to liquidity across different markets such as the bank loan market and capital markets in Europe, Japan and United States. Moreover, IAG worked closely with the financial institutions on maintaining available derivatives trading credit lines to support the business needs.\n\nFinally, on the aircraft leasing front, during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, IAG approached its lessors and agreed the deferral of lease payments. Most lessors supported IAG at this time and more recently, many lessors have entered into further agreements to provide additional support, working together on more structural changes to our existing lease agreements that better suit the evolving business needs of both IAG and our lessor partners.\n\nDuring 2020 IAG also entered into a number of new sale and lease back transactions with lessors to finance new aircraft deliveries, as well as agreeing terms that have facilitated the delivery of already committed direct lease aircraft, to the benefit of IAG and the lessors involved.",

IAG and its operating companies rely on a number of partnerships with airlines across the world. These partnerships are an efficient way to strengthen the operating companies' marketing and distribution presence in 'non-home' markets, and to extend the number of destinations we can offer to our customers. The customer bases of these partners also provide a vital source of traffic to sustain the overall scale of our airlines.\n\nIAG takes a leading role in the international associations of which its airlines are members, in particular IATA and A4E (Airlines for Europe) as well as the national airline associations in Spain (ACETA) and the UK (Airlines UK), participating through the relevant corporate governance structures. As far as partnerships are concerned, each has formal governance structures in place, with regular meetings to monitor progress against a set of agreed outcomes. Informal working level engagement on a continuous basis also occurs, usually to progress specific initiatives that require additional focus. Many of our partnerships have emanated through our participation in the one world alliance. They can vary in size from simple bilateral agreements between an operating company and a partner airline to market the services of each other on a number of routes, to a fully comprehensive immunised joint business extending across a number of regions and allowing participants to coordinate on pricing and capacity decisions.\n\nParticipation in industry bodies has been particularly important this year, with an emphasis on delivering common messaging and influencing of governments, calling for unified and consistent measures to better allow the industry to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite very low levels of flying, the Group's partnerships and the one world alliance have remained a central focus as the IAG airlines think about how to rebuild their networks and offer the best possible proposition to customers during the recovery. IAG has also worked closely with the one world alliance in trialling COVID-19 testing across the Atlantic as a way of safely reopening/uni00A0markets.\n\nIAG manages its engagement with government and regulatory stakeholders through a small team reporting to the Chief of Staff. This is supported by representatives in Madrid and Dublin who can engage quickly with local stakeholders where necessary. In doing so IAG's government affairs team regularly includes operating company colleagues to ensure technical expertise and local knowledge is leveraged. This approach has been particularly beneficial to the Group in responding to the actions of governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, IAG continued to engage closely with the national governments, regulators and parliamentarians in the states in which its airlines are based, as/uni00A0well as other key jurisdictions (in particular the US) as well as with relevant/uni00A0supra-national organisations such as the International Civil Aviation/uni00A0Organisation (ICAO), the European Commission and other European/uni00A0Institutions.\n\nThe Group employs informal and formal mechanisms for engagement. These include taking part in individual meetings with ministers, officials, parliamentarians and industry regulators; providing written input to formal consultations; and membership of industry expert groups. This is often done collectively through trade associations, in particular International Air Transport Association (IATA), A4E and national airlines associations, as well as directly and through bilateral IAG representation.\n\nIn 2020, engagement has focused on COVID-19, Brexit and sustainability. In response to the pandemic, government decisions have tended to be more rapid than usual and the direct impacts on IAG operating companies have been more profound as authorities around the world have restricted air travel. In addition to restricting movement of citizens by various means, including through flight bans and immigration controls, governments have introduced a range of measures directly affecting airline operations.\n\nThe Group has contributed directly to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, helping develop national and EU guidance, particularly on safety and security isues and including health protection measures, passenger facilitation processes and requirements to provide authorities with passenger data. The Group aims to help develop best practices and workable solutions that can allow travel to continue while restricting the spread of the virus.\n\nIn the lead up to the agreement of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, IAG was in regular contact through individual meetings with national regulators and ministers on both sides of the negotiations to explain the Group position.\n\nIAG's input into sustainability policies continued, including the IAG Chief Executive Officer's engagement with European Commissioners through A4E, and British Airways' as a member of the UK's Jet Zero Council.",

In order to aid the COVID-19 relief efforts, the Group has flown critical equipment and essential medical supplies across the world, and each of the Group's airlines offered repatriation flights to bring customers safely home/uni00A0after the introduction of COVID-19-related travel restrictions and/uni00A0border closures. Each brand and operation also focused on supporting their local communities through charitable work such as volunteering at local hospitals, donating supplies and delivering care packages.\n\nIAG's airlines have adapted the customer journey by introducing a range of measures to support consumer confidence. With the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in variable and unpredictable travel rules, the Group's airlines have implemented commercial reassurance measures for customers,\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\n2020\n\n36.7\n\n+10.9 pts vly\n\nDefinition and purpose\n\nNPS is a non-financial metric which measures the customer's sentiment and loyalty to a brand. At IAG a transactional NPS is measured: customers respond about their likelihood of recommending an IAG operating carrier no more than seven days after taking a flight. Including NPS targets in the Group's employee bonus scheme has driven a stronger focus on improving the customer experience, which together with customer advocacy drives competitive\n\nsuch as extending flexible booking policies and guaranteeing flights that will operate. In addition, IAG supported the development of a COVID-19 insurance product aimed to support and protect customers against travel restrictions and health concerns.\n\nThe Group has influenced and trialled industry guidelines for safe travel, such as ICAO's Council Aviation Recovery Taskforce (CART) 'Take-off' Guidance. IAG has also been working with government and industry bodies to call for an effective COVID-19 testing procedure which could be used to reduce or remove quarantine requirements and enhance passenger safety onboard. In support of this, British Airways, together with its joint business partner American Airlines and the one world alliance, has trialled COVID-19 testing on routes from the USA to London Heathrow. All brands have also updated their customer communications to provide clear guidance on the new airport and onboard procedures, COVID-19 specific\n\nadvantage, leading to faster organic growth.\n\nPerformance\n\nIAG's NPS in 2020 increased 10.9 points versus 2019, achieving record levels of customer satisfaction and growth across all IAG airlines. However, this score must be viewed in the context of the pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has altered customer expectations and demanded a significant change in the flying experience. IAG has adapted the customer journey by introducing a range of reassurance measures to protect the safety and wellbeing of our customers, including revised service routines to promote social distancing, increased levels of aircraft cleaning and the provision of complimentary personal protection packs to all customers on board. The customer response to these and other\n\nentry requirements for relevant destinations and an overview of the enhanced cleaning measures adopted by the airline.\n\n## Our priorities for 2021\n\nThe Group will continue its leading\n\nwork on safety, aiming to ensure its businesses can deliver an unrivalled customer proposition that adapts to meet changing customer expectations, regulatory requirements and drives customer trust as well as satisfaction. The brands will continue to deepen their understanding of changes in the needs and expectations of different customer types, in particular as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and will evolve their products and services to best deliver against the needs of the customer. Strong emphasis will be placed on digitalisation, including automating disruption management and delivering touchless travel solutions.\n\nreassurance measures has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nAt the same time, the reduced flying schedule in 2020 has helped deliver improved on-time performance whilst the decrease in customer demand has contributed to lower load factors, both of which have historically been closely correlated with customer satisfaction.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the flying experience makes comparisons with prior and future periods challenging, however the Group's NPS performance in the first two months of 2020 (when customer demand was similar to that of the prior year) exceeded equivalent 2019 levels, suggesting a continuation of the positive customer satisfaction trends exhibited in recent years in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Additionally, in October, IAG successfully secured \u20ac2.74 billion in funding through a capital increase which has helped strengthen the financial position of the Group's existing businesses. These actions will allow the Group to take advantage of opportunities for value-accretive growth that may arise as we recover from the pandemic.\n\n## Our priorities for 2021\n\nAs and when the global aviation industry starts to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group's priority will be to invest in strengthening and maintaining its leadership positions in each of its home\n\ncities by managing and optimising its networks to meet demand.\n\nFollowing receipt of antitrust approval for Aer Lingus to join the Atlantic Joint Business in December 2020, IAG will progress the integration of Aer Lingus into the joint business. In addition, the Group will continue to leverage its other joint businesses, alliances and partnerships and where appropriate form new joint businesses.\n\nThe Air Europa acquisition remains subject to approval from competition authorities. If approval is received, IAG will then prioritise the integration of Air Europa into the Group and commence delivering the synergies brought about by the acquisition.",

        "page_content": "## Preserving liquidity and preparing for recovery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 has been an exceptional and challenging year for the Group, with the unparalleled set of circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. IAG, thanks to its unique structure was able to react quickly, with an intense focus on liquidity.\n\nThe year had started well, with performance in January and February in line with previous plans. However, as the pandemic spread across the globe, the Group had to severely curtail its operations in the second quarter. The summer saw some easing of restrictions, with evidence of strong pent-up demand from customers to travel, but the impact of the virus increased again as winter approached, resulting in further restrictions on freedom of movement and travel being imposed. Passenger capacity for the year was only a/uni00A0third of that operated in 2019. One welcome development at the end of the/uni00A0year was that the UK agreed a trade deal with the EU, removing one source of/uni00A0uncertainty.\n\nThe Group took, and continues to take, decisive actions to preserve liquidity and to ensure it is positioned for the recovery, when it comes. Multiple workstreams and initiatives have been delivered, which can be summarised in five main areas: capacity, operating costs, working capital, capital expenditure and funding.\n\nThe Group reduced passenger capacity, with a focus on ensuring the remaining flying was cash-positive. The cargo operation introduced additional cargo-only\n\nflights and ended the year with record revenues. Many initiatives were implemented to reduce costs and the Group has made use of wage support and temporary redundancy arrangements in its home markets. Restructuring plans have been agreed and implemented during the year, leading to a reduction in employee numbers of over 10,000; additional flexibility has been introduced to make employee costs more variable with the level of activity. However, the cost savings achieved were outweighed by a 75 per cent drop in passenger revenue. In addition, exceptional charges were triggered by a fleet of aircraft, and fuel and foreign exchange hedging programmes too large for the significantly reduced operation. The resulting operating loss for the year was \u20ac7,426 million. The operating loss before exceptional items was \u20ac4,365 million, down \u20ac7,650 million on/uni00A02019.\n\nThe Group was able to negotiate a new eight year contract between American Express and IAG Loyalty, with an up-front receipt of \u20ac830 million. Capital expenditure was cut by more than half, following constructive discussions with aircraft manufacturers to delay deliveries of aircraft and payments planned for 2020 and the following years.\n\nDespite the credit rating agencies' downgrades of their ratings for IAG and British Airways to below investment grade, the Group raised \u20ac1.4 billion of additional non-aircraft debt, including \u20ac1.0 billion\n\n' The Group took, and continues to take, decisive actions to preserve liquidity. '\n\npartly guaranteed by Spain's Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial ('ICO'), in addition to \u20ac0.8 billion of bridging facilities against aircraft. The successful completion of long-term financing for aircraft deliveries meant the bridging facilities were repaid in the year. Aircraft financing generated \u20ac2.2 billion, higher than the total capital expenditure of \u20ac1.9 billion. A \u20ac2.7 billion rights issue, which was fully subscribed, was completed in September. In December, the Group secured a \u20ac2.2 billion 5-year loan facility for British/uni00A0Airways, partly guaranteed by UK/uni00A0Export Finance.\n\nThe timing and shape of recovery is uncertain and hence the Group remains focused on preserving liquidity and transforming its businesses for the future. The Group continues to develop initiatives to improve its cost-base, with a focus on reducing fixed costs and making the remaining cost structure more flexible and variable with capacity. The Group continues to review and develop other funding initiatives to provide further resilience, should it be required. Due to all of the hard work undertaken to preserve liquidity, the Group enters 2021 with total liquidity, including the recent UK Export Finance debt, higher than at the start of/uni00A02020.\n\n## Steve Gunning\n\nChief Financial Officer",

        "page_content": "## Structure of Financial Review\n\nDue to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and governments' responses, many of the usual variance analysis and measures are significantly less meaningful than in previous years and in some cases measures used previously no longer provide relevant insight into understanding the performance of the Group. As a consequence, unlike in prior years, in this review there is no detail on industry growth rates and GDP by market, as in 2020 the main drivers of capacity and revenue were COVID-19 and the related governmental travel bans and restrictions, rather than broader economic factors. This review, therefore, is structured to provide detail about the impact of COVID-19 on/uni00A0the Group, including the measures the Group has taken to/uni00A0mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic. Where variances exceed 100 per cent they have been substituted with 'nm' for 'not meaningful' and the absolute values are/uni00A0shown.\n\n## COVID-19 impact and IAG's response\n\nThe main impact of COVID-19 materialised as a significant drop/uni00A0in/uni00A0the demand for passenger flights, linked to both the pandemic/uni00A0itself and the travel restrictions introduced by national governments, which changed many times through the year, normally with no or very short notice, thereby creating uncertainty for customers.\n\nAs a result of the significantly reduced flying programme, aircraft/uni00A0had to be temporarily grounded, with some retired early. Jet/uni00A0fuel/uni00A0consumption was significantly lower than that on which the Group's hedging programme was based, leading to the discontinuation of hedge accounting for the related derivative financial instruments. In addition, the commodity price of jet fuel/uni00A0fell sharply, leading to significant losses related to the hedging/uni00A0programme.\n\nThe Group acted quickly to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on its liquidity and results, through reductions in operating and capital expenditure, together with working capital initiatives and additional funding. The success of these measures was recognised by all three credit rating agencies, however, the severity of the deterioration in operating conditions resulted in successive downgrading of both IAG's and British Airways' credit ratings to below investment grade. The main measures taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Group are shown opposite and reviewed in further detail below.\n\n## Key COVID-19 mitigations\n\n| Demand and  capacity   | \u00b7 Passenger capacity 66.5% lower than 2019 \u00b7 Additional cargo flights, including for  essential equipment and supplies                                        |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fleet reductions       | \u00b7 Temporary grounding and parking  of/uni00A0aircraft                                                                                                         |\n|                        | \u00b7 Early retirement of aircraft, including British  Airways Boeing 747-400s and Iberia Airbus  A340-600s, plus lease returns                                   |\n| Operating costs        | \u00b7 Pay cuts, wage support, furlough and  temporary reductions in hours worked and  employee numbers                                                            |\n|                        | \u00b7 Restructuring in British Airways and  Aer Lingus, with increased flexibility                                                                                |\n|                        | \u00b7 Non-essential discretionary spend reduced                                                                                                                   |\n| Capital                | \u00b7 Deferral of delivery of 68 aircraft                                                                                                                         |\n| expenditure            | \u00b7 Reduction in other capital expenditure;  cyber spend retained                                                                                               |\n| Working capital        | \u00b7 2019 final dividend proposal withdrawn and  no 2020 dividend                                                                                                |\n|                        | \u00b7 Reduction in trade receivables \u00b7 Impact of reduction in bookings for future  travel mitigated by customers opting to  take vouchers in lieu of cash refunds |\n|                        | \u00b7 With agreement, deferred supplier  payments treasury settlements and  lease/uni00A0payments                                                                 |\n|                        | \u00b7 American Express loyalty contract renewal,  with significant pre-payment \u00b7 Accelerated tax refunds from 2021 to 2020                                        |\n|                        | and deferral of UK HMRC payments \u00b7 Deferred UK and US pension contributions                                                                                   |\n| Funding                | \u00b7 Aircraft financed throughout year (sale and                                                                                                                 |\n|                        | leaseback and new \u20ac1 billion EETC facility) \u00b7 British Airways Revolving Credit Facility  extended by one year; other credit  lines/uni00A0secured             |\n|                        | \u00b7 \u20ac328 million commercial paper issued  under UK's CCFF \u00b7 \u20ac1 billion debt through ICO-backed loans                                                            |\n|                        | in/uni00A0Spain \u00b7 \u20ac75 million debt through ISIF-backed loans                                                                                                  |\n|                        | in Ireland, potential for further \u20ac75 million \u00b7 \u00a32 billion UK Export Finance loan agreed                                                                      |",

        "page_content": "## Demand and capacity\n\n## IAG capacity\n\nIn 2020, all of IAG's airlines significantly reduced passenger capacity, with total Group capacity, measured in Available seat kilometres (ASKs), down 66.5 per cent versus 2019. The early months of the year started in line with the Group's plans approved by the Board in December 2019, aside from a limited COVID-19 impact mainly in the Asia Pacific region with suspension of services to China at the end of January and other capacity reductions across the region. Passenger capacity was 1.4 per cent higher than 2019 in January and 2.9 per cent higher in February. From late February, as the virus spread across the globe, many governments placed significant restrictions on the movement of people and on travel across international borders. This led to the cancellation of all flights to, from and within Italy and extensive reductions across the whole network, with capacity in the first quarter down 10.5 per cent on 2019.\n\nIn the second quarter, due to the impact of the virus worldwide and the associated travel and border restrictions applying in most countries, the Group was only able to operate a skeleton passenger schedule, with capacity operated only 5 per cent of that operated in the same quarter 2019. The third quarter showed improvement and additional capacity was introduced, mainly driven by leisure demand and for those visiting friends and relatives (VFR); however, capacity was still down 78.6 per cent on the previous year. Where travel restrictions were removed the Group saw a strong level of travel demand from customers. Plans to increase capacity steadily during the fourth quarter had to be revised, as a second wave of infections swept across Europe and governments re-imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions. Capacity for the fourth quarter was down 73.4 per cent.\n\nThe IAG passenger load factor was down 20.8 points from 2019 to 63.8 points, also impacted by travel restrictions, which changed frequently, together with low demand and a higher than normal level of passengers not checking in for flights that were still operating ('no-shows'). One consequence of the reduction in passenger capacity across the industry was a reduction in hold space available for cargo purposes, leading to reduced overall cargo supply and a more favourable cargo yield environment than/uni00A0in the previous year.\n\n## IAG capacity\n\n| Year to December 31, 2020            | ASKs  higher/ (lower) vly   |   Passenger  load factor | Higher/  (lower)   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| Domestic                             | (49.8)%                     |                     71   | (16.2) pts         |\n| Europe                               | (70.5)%                     |                     64.6 | (19.0) pts         |\n| North America                        | (69.3)%                     |                     53.2 | (30.9) pts         |\n| Latin America and Caribbean          | (64.3)%                     |                     72.7 | (13.7) pts         |\n| Africa, Middle East   and South Asia | (61.4)%                     |                     67.2 | (15.8) pts         |\n| Asia Pacific                         | (70.7)%                     |                     61.3 | (24.5) pts         |\n| Total network                        | (66.5)%                     |                     63.8 | (20.8) pts         |\n\n## Domestic and Europe\n\nTogether, IAG's Domestic and European markets continue to represent the Group's largest region. However, capacity across both was, and continues to be, significantly impacted by the travel restrictions and quarantines imposed by European governments.\n\nCapacity in IAG's Domestic markets decreased by 49.8 per cent versus 2019. British Airways' capacity reflected demand from UK holidaymakers avoiding overseas destinations subject to quarantine restrictions, Scottish routes re-opened in quarter 2 and a new route to Newquay launched in the summer. Vueling focused its operations on connecting the Spanish peninsula with the Canary and Balearic Islands and Iberia maintained similar Domestic routes for connectivity. Aer Lingus' route between London and Belfast benefitted from UK citizens opting for domestic holidays, with load factors reaching 70 per cent in August. Passenger load factor in the region remained above 70 per cent as Spanish and UK government travel restrictions and quarantine rules prompted an increase in travellers opting for holidays in their home country.\n\nThe Group's capacity in Europe decreased 70.5 per cent year on/uni00A0year. As the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread, Vueling limited its operations outside of Spain as demand remained weak throughout 2020. Iberia maintained minimum operations to keep major European cities, including London, Paris and Madrid, connected in quarter 2 and expanded operations in quarter 3 to meet summer leisure demand. In quarter 3 British Airways had a good performance throughout the summer on the limited number of routes operated to destinations included on the UK Government's 'Travel Corridor' list. Aer Lingus' European operations were limited by the Irish government's 'Green List', which severely restricted travel and discouraged Irish citizens from non-essential travel. LEVEL's operations in Vienna and Amsterdam ceased on June 19, 2020.\n\n## North America\n\nIAG's North American market accounts for almost 30 per cent of the Group's ASKs. The region's capacity increase at the beginning of 2020 reflected the full-year impact of routes launched during 2019, including British Airways' route to Pittsburgh, Aer Lingus' route to Minneapolis and LEVEL's route to New York, JFK. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, a much-reduced flight schedule to North America operated, primarily for cargo purposes, with British Airways and Aer Lingus operating regular flights to New York, Boston, Washington and Chicago. Iberia resumed operations to Chicago in quarter 3 and LEVEL Spain restarted its route to JFK in September. Quarter 4 benefited from increased leisure and VFR travel around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, with routes to second-home markets such as Miami performing well. LEVEL France ceased operations on July 8, leading to the cancellation of its routes to Newark and Las Vegas. Passenger load factor for the region was the lowest for the Group as the United States government's COVID-19 restrictions allowed only residents and nationals to enter the country.",

        "page_content": "## Latin America and Caribbean (LACAR)\n\nIAG's capacity in LACAR increased in January and February driven by Iberia's new route to Guayaquil, Ecuador launched in 2019 and additional frequencies on routes to Colombia, Peru and Brazil. LEVEL's growth reflected the annualisation of new routes launched in 2019 to Santiago de Chile and additional frequencies on routes to the French Caribbean. However, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, LACAR operations were extremely limited, due to strict government restrictions and high COVID-19 case numbers impacting the region, with regular operations only starting to resume in quarter 3. British Airways operated a number of charter flights to the Caribbean in quarter 2 and restarted regular service to a number of destinations in quarter 3. In quarter 4 flights operated regularly to S\u00e3o Paulo, Antigua and Saint Lucia, benefiting from leisure travel over the holiday period. In quarter 2, Iberia's operations were mainly for repatriation and cargo purposes and routes to Panama City, Santo Domingo and Quito resumed in quarter 3. Quarter 4 benefited from significant VFR travel to the region with load factors to routes in Ecuador and Dominican Republic reaching over 80 per cent. LEVEL France operations to the French Caribbean ceased in July, however LEVEL Spain continues to operate and resumed limited operations to Buenos Aires in September and Santiago de Chile in December. Passenger load factor in this region was the highest for the Group, down only 13.7 points on 2019 to 72.7/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent.\n\n## Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)\n\nAMESA capacity increased in January and February primarily due to new routes launched in 2019 by British Airways, including to Dammam via Bahrain and Islamabad. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 and initial lockdowns, regular operations did not restart until quarter 3 with British Airways returning to Dubai, Kenya, Israel, India and Pakistan. Iberia restarted its regular service to Dakar, Senegal in July but did not reopen regular operations to Morocco and Israel in 2020. Vueling did not restart any regular operations to the region in 2020. Passenger load factor for the region was down 15.8 points versus 2019 to 67.2 per cent.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region, the Group's capacity was down significantly on 2019 and it was the first region to see cancellations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in late January. British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus all operated government charter flights to the region, carrying back Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the first wave of the pandemic. Since then, there has been a steady return to flying with British Airways reopening routes to China, Hong Kong and Tokyo, although strict travel restrictions remain in place limiting capacity, with China only allowing international carriers to operate one flight per week on a single route. Passenger load factor was down 24.5 points to 61.3 per cent on a capacity decrease of 70.7 per cent.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nBased on the extensive modelling the Group has undertaken in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity for the going concern assessment period to March 31, 2022, and accordingly the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are a number of significant factors related to COVID-19 that are outside of the control of the Group, including the status and impact of the pandemic worldwide, including the emergence of new variants of the virus and potential resurgence of existing strains of the virus; the availability of vaccines worldwide, together with the speed at which they are deployed; the efficacy of those vaccines; and the restrictions imposed by national governments in respect of the freedom of movement and travel. Due to the uncertainty that these factors create, the Group is not able to provide certainty that there could not be more severe downside scenarios than those it has considered, including the sensitivities it has considered in relation to factors such as the impact on yield, capacity operated, cost mitigations achieved and the availability of aircraft financing to offset capital expenditure. In the event that such a scenario were to occur, the Group would need to implement additional mitigation measures and would likely need to secure additional funding over and above that which is contractually committed at February 25, 2021. The Group has been successful in raising financing since the outbreak of COVID-19, having financed all aircraft deliveries in 2020, secured an additional \u20ac3.6 billion of non-aircraft debt and having completed an equity increase of \u20ac2.7 billion in September 2020, which was fully subscribed. However, the Group cannot provide certainty that it will be able to secure additional funding, if required, in the event that a more severe downside scenario than those it has considered were to occur. Refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn light of the significant reduction in the Group's passenger capacity linked to the impact of COVID-19, the year saw a significant reduction in passenger revenue. The Group took action to mitigate the impact through exploiting cargo opportunities and by reducing costs. The Group also recognised exceptional charges for restructuring costs, the discontinuance of hedge accounting in relation to fuel and foreign currency derivatives and the impairment of aircraft and related assets either retired or stood down early. The net result was an operating loss for the year of \u20ac7,426 million, versus an operating profit in 2019 of \u20ac2,613 million. The reported loss after tax for the year was \u20ac6,923 million, versus a profit of \u20ac1,715 million in 2019.\n\n## (Loss)/profit for the year\n\n| Statutory results  \u20ac million   | 2020    | 2019   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------------|\n| Operating (loss)/profit        | (7,426) | 2,613  | (10,039)               |\n| (Loss)/profit before tax       | (7,810) | 2,275  | (10,085)               |\n| (Loss)/profit after tax        | (6,923) | 1,715  | (8,638)                |",

The cargo business identified markets most impacted by the reduction in air cargo supply, where demand would not be met by traditional freighter services and that could support the yields required to fly cargoonly services using passenger aircraft. The focus of cargo-only flying was to ensure a cash-positive contribution was achieved for the airlines and the Group. Cargo opportunities were increased by removing seats from five passenger aircraft and obtaining regulatory approvals to load cargo in the passenger cabins. During the year 4,003 additional cargo-driven flights were operated; these additional flights are not included in the passenger capacity figures for ASKs, as seats were not offered for general sale to passengers.\n\nThe overall impact of the cargo operation, including the additional/uni00A0cargo-driven flights linked to the COVID-19 response, was an increase in Cargo revenue of \u20ac189 million, or 16.9 per cent versus 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Other revenue\n\nThe largest Other revenue streams for the Group in normal times are Iberia's Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and Handling businesses, together with BA Holidays. Revenue from these activities was also significantly reduced versus the previous year, linked to lower activity levels associated with COVID-19. In the case of MRO and Handling, these revenues were affected by reduced demand following lower flight schedules and significant fleet reductions across the airline industry and hence lower maintenance requirements, although the reductions were less than the reduction in the level of passenger capacity. The BA Holidays business is closely linked to the passenger business and was therefore impacted by the significantly reduced passenger operation. Loyalty revenues were also down on 2019, as the lower flying programme led to a reduced number of redemptions of Avios and a reduced volume of the sale of Avios to third parties, linked to the reduced level of expenditure on travel. Other ancillary revenue streams were also affected by the impact of the pandemic, including handling recoveries in Terminal 7 at New York, JFK. In total Other revenue was down \u20ac933 million, or 48.6 per cent versus 2019.\n\n## Fleet reductions\n\nThe Group anticipates that as a result of COVID-19, demand will continue to be supressed for several years and will not reach levels seen in 2019 until at least 2023. The Group, therefore, took steps to reduce its aircraft fleet and the associated cost of maintenance.\n\nDuring 2020, a significant number of aircraft were temporarily grounded and parked, with the limited operations focused on flying the more fuel-efficient new-generation aircraft, where possible. The Group also decided to accelerate the retirement of its older, four-engined longhaul fleet. British Airways retired its fleet of 32 Boeing 747-400 aircraft, and Iberia retired its fleet of 15 Airbus A340-600 aircraft. In addition to these retirements, 37 aircraft were stood down earlier than planned, either pending disposal or return to lessors, bringing the reductions in fleet numbers to 84 aircraft. However, the Group also took delivery of 34 aircraft during the year, detailed in the Capital expenditure section below.\n\nThe early retirement and stand-down of these aircraft led to an exceptional impairment charge of \u20ac837 million; there was also a \u20ac108 million exceptional charge related to a write-down of inventory and recognition of contractual end-of-lease provisions.\n\n## Number of fleet\n\n| Number of fleet in-service   |   2020 |   2019 | Higher/ (lower) vly   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| Shorthaul                    |    367 |    394 | (6.9)%                |\n| Longhaul                     |    166 |    204 | (18.6)%               |\n| /uni00A0                     |    533 |    598 | (10.9)%               |\n\n241 of the 533 'in-service' fleet at the end of the year were temporarily grounded. In addition to the in-service fleet, there were a further 71 aircraft held by the Group pending disposal or lease return and 1 new aircraft that had been delivered to the Group and paid for but had not yet entered service.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nDue to the reduced flying programme and significantly reduced revenues, the Group took action to offset the financial impact by reducing costs, together with measures to increase the variability and flexibility in its cost base. Total expenditure on operations before exceptional items fell from \u20ac22,221 million in 2019 to \u20ac12,233 million in 2020, a 44.9 per cent reduction, compared to the reduction in passenger capacity, measured in ASKs, of 66.5 per cent. The reduction in operating costs before exceptional items and excluding depreciation, amortisation and impairment was 49.6 per cent.\n\n## Employee costs\n\n| \u20ac million        | 2020   | Higher/  (lower) vly   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|------------------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Employee costs 1 | 3,560  | (2,074)                | (36.8)%                |\n\nNational governments provided wage or job support mechanisms in each of IAG's main home markets and the operating companies used these facilities to reduce employee numbers and costs, with the direct impact of these mechanisms reducing employee costs by approximately \u20ac730 million. Other arrangements were agreed for staff not directly covered by such schemes and so costs were reduced at all levels in the organisation, with the Management Committee and Board members also seeing reductions as outlined in the Report of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn addition to temporary measures, both British Airways and Aer Lingus implemented longer-term restructuring, consistent with the expected multi-year impact of COVID-19 on demand. The restructuring measures will result in reductions at British Airways of approximately 10,000 employees (or one quarter of the workforce at June 2020) and 500 at Aer Lingus (or approximately 10 per cent of the workforce at June 2020); the substantial majority of employees affected had left the Group by the end of 2020. British Airways has also introduced more flexibility in certain operational areas, in order to be able to better adjust employee numbers and cost to the level of capacity operated. Iberia also made reductions in management numbers, together with restructuring related to staff outside of Spain. Iberia and Vueling made use of the temporary redundancy arrangements in Spain under an Expedientes de Regulaci\u00f3n Temporal de Empleo ('ERTE') arrangement and hence did not incur restructuring costs in respect of non-managerial employees in Spain. The closure of LEVEL France led to an exceptional provision of \u20ac28 million for the associated employee restructuring costs. The total exceptional employee restructuring charges for the year included within Employee costs were \u20ac313 million.\n\nIn addition to the wage and pay support schemes and restructuring programmes outlined above, other measures were taken to further reduce employee costs, such as offering unpaid leave, the removal of bonuses and reduced non-mandatory training. Measures were taken at all levels across the Group.",

Although there was a partial recovery during the remainder of the year, prices were still at levels much lower than 2019.\n\n## Jet fuel price trend ($/mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices by hedging prices up to three years in advance. The hedging programme is based on expected levels of activity, with the proportion hedged in line with treasury policies agreed with the Board.\n\nIn 2020, due to the rapid fall in the commodity fuel price, the Group has experienced losses on its fuel hedging derivatives. These hedging losses would have normally been offset against the reduced cost of physical fuel purchased. However, the impact of COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in the requirement to purchase jet fuel, due to the significantly reduced flying programme. As a consequence, the Group had derivative contracts for which there was no corresponding purchase of jet fuel, leading to discontinuance of hedge accounting for these derivatives, with the mark-to-market loss of \u20ac1,781 million recognised as an exceptional charge in the Income statement. There was also a related mark-to-market gain recognised in the Income statement related to foreign exchange hedging of \u20ac87 million, bringing the net exceptional charge to \u20ac1,694 million for the year. These values are calculated based on the fuel curve and foreign exchange rates as at December 31, 2020 and the anticipated capacity to be operated for 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe Group continued to benefit from reduced fuel consumption associated with the investment in new fleet, together with the early retirement of older aircraft. Overall fuel, oil and emissions\n\ncharges were down \u20ac2,286 million, or 38.0 per cent versus 2019; excluding the exceptional net overhedging charge fuel, oil and emissions charges were down \u20ac3,980 million, or 66.1 per cent.\n\n## Supplier costs\n\n| \u20ac million                                     | 2020   | Higher/  (lower) vly   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Handling, catering and other  operating costs | 1,340  | (1,632)                | (54.9)%                |\n| Landing fees and en-route  charges            | 918    | (1,303)                | (58.7)%                |\n| Engineering and other aircraft  costs 1       | 1,456  | (636)                  | (30.4)%                |\n| Property, IT and other costs 2                | 782    | (29)                   | (3.6)%                 |\n| Selling costs                                 | 405    | (633)                  | (61.0)%                |\n| Currency differences                          | 81     | 88                     | nm                     |\n\nHandling, catering and other operating costs were down \u20ac1,632 million on 2019, or 54.9 per cent. In addition to volumelinked savings, including the reduced product costs associated with lower BA Holidays revenues, costs were reduced by management actions, such as the closure of airport lounges and by the necessary reduction in catering, linked to measures to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to customers and/uni00A0staff.\n\nLanding fees and en-route charges were down \u20ac1,303 million on 2019, or 58.7 per cent. Costs reduced in line with the lower flying programme, although there was some adverse impact from lost volume rebates and equivalent arrangements, including at London Heathrow, together with price increases from Eurocontrol.\n\nEngineering and other aircraft costs reduced due to the reduction in flights operated, together with the reduction in Iberia's external MRO business and other savings in the wake of COVID-19. Engineering and other aircraft costs were down \u20ac636 million, or 30.4 per cent; excluding the exceptional charge, due to the write-down of inventory and provision for lease return costs, Engineering and other aircraft costs were down \u20ac744 million, or 35.6 per cent.\n\nProperty, IT and other costs were down \u20ac29 million, or 3.6 per cent, on 2019, including the final penalty notice issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office regarding the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018; excluding the cost of this final penalty notice Property, IT and other costs were down \u20ac57 million or 7.0 per cent. Cost savings associated with the lower volume of IT transactions and reduced energy usage and rates were partly offset by the costs associated with IT infrastructure investment. The 2019 base included income from a settlement in respect of a British Airways data centre issue in 2017.",

Selling costs were \u20ac633 million lower than the previous year, or 61.0 per cent.\n\n## Ownership costs\n\nOwnership costs include depreciation, amortisation and impairment of tangible and intangible assets. The Group adopted IFRS 16 'Leases' from January 1, 2019, meaning right of use assets in respect of leases are included with the Balance sheet and associated depreciation of those right of use assets is included within depreciation.\n\n| \u20ac million         | 2020   |   Higher/  (lower) vly | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Ownership costs 1 | 2,955  |                    844 | 40.0%                  |\n\nThe increase in ownership costs of \u20ac844 million, or 40.0 per cent, is driven by the \u20ac856 million impairment charge in respect of the retirement of the British Airways Boeing 747-400 and Iberia Airbus A340-600 fleets, and related other assets, together with the early stand down or lease return of 37 other aircraft. Excluding these items, ownership costs would have been at a similar level to 2019.\n\n## Exchange rate impact\n\nExchange rate impacts are calculated by retranslating current year results at prior year exchange rates. The reported revenues and expenditures are impacted by the translation of currencies other than euro to the Group's reporting currency of euro, primarily British Airways and IAG Loyalty. From a transaction perspective, the Group performance is impacted by the fluctuation of exchange rates, primarily exposure to the pound sterling, euro and US dollar. The Group typically generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business, except the US dollar, for which capital expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically create a deficit which is managed and partially hedged. The Group hedges its economic exposure from transacting in foreign currencies but does not hedge the translation impact of reporting in euro.\n\nOverall, in 2020 the Group operating loss before exceptional items was increased by \u20ac5 million due to adverse exchange rate/uni00A0impacts.\n\n## Exchange impact before exceptional items\n\n2020\n\n| \u20ac million  Favourable/(adverse)                  | Translation  impact   | Transaction  impact   | Total  exchange  impact   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Total exchange impact  on/uni00A0revenue         | 84                    | 33                    | 117                       |\n| Total exchange impact on  operating expenditures | (31)                  | (91)                  | (122)                     |\n| Total exchange impact on  operating loss         | 53                    | (58)                  | (5)                       |\n\n|                                                  | 2019                | 2019                | 2019                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million  Favourable/(adverse)                  | Translation  impact | Transaction  impact | Total  exchange  impact |\n| Total exchange impact  on/uni00A0revenue         | 68                  | 325                 | 393                     |\n| Total exchange impact on  operating expenditures | (58)                | (268)               | (326)                   |\n| Total exchange impact on  operating profit       | 10                  | 57                  | 67                      |\n\nThe exchange rates for the Group were as follows:\n\n|                                                    | 2020   | 2019   | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Translation - Balance sheet                        |        |        |                        |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.10   | 1.18   | (6.8%)                 |\n| Translation - Income statement  (weighted average) |        |        |                        |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.13   | 1.13   | 0.0%                   |\n| Transaction (weighted  average)                    |        |        |                        |\n| \u00a3 to \u20ac                                             | 1.13   | 1.13   | 0.0%                   |\n| \u20ac to $                                             | 1.13   | 1.12   | 0.9%                   |\n| \u00a3 to $                                             | 1.27   | 1.27   | 0.0%                   |\n\n## Total net non operating costs\n\nTotal net non-operating costs for the year were \u20ac384 million, versus \u20ac338 million in 2019. The main driver of the increase was finance costs up \u20ac59 million (9.7 per cent), related to interest on new debt and arrangement costs. In both years the finance costs were partially offset by net currency retranslation credits, mainly related to the retranslation of US dollar balances and related derivate financial instruments.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax credit for the period was \u20ac887 million (2019: tax charge of \u20ac560 million), with an effective tax rate (credit) for the Group of 11 per cent (2019: 25 per cent charge). The substantial majority of the Group's activities are taxed where the main operations are based, in the UK, Spain and Ireland, with corporation tax rates during 2020 of 19 per cent, 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, which results in an expected effective tax rate of 21 per cent. The difference between the expected effective tax rate of 21 per cent and the actual effective tax rate of 11 per cent was firstly due to not recognising tax credits in respect of certain current and prior period losses and deductible temporary differences; those losses and deductible temporary differences relate principally to Iberia, Openskies and Vueling. In addition, the UK Government retained its rate of corporation tax rate at 19 per cent from April 1, 2020, in place of the reduction to 17 per cent that had previously been enacted into law.",

        "page_content": "## Review by operating company\n\nThe results after exceptional items for each operating company are shown previously, along with the Alternative Performance Measures, which/uni00A0exclude exceptional items, as detailed in the Alternative Performance Measures section.\n\nThe results for all operating companies were significantly impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and the main items driving the results of the four main operating companies are therefore common, many of which have been covered above. All four of the operating companies saw significant reductions in passenger revenue and took measures to reduce operating costs and preserve liquidity. British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus benefited from additional cargo flights and higher cargo yields, with both British Airways and Aer Lingus generating higher cargo revenue than in 2019.\n\nEmployee costs fell due to the use of wage support or similar schemes, particularly in the UK and Ireland, with temporary redundancy programmes under the ERTE arrangement operating in Spain. British Airways and Aer Lingus undertook restructuring programmes during the year, with Iberia also making reductions in management numbers and reductions outside of Spain.\n\nThe operating companies all operate similar hedging programmes, under a centrally agreed Group policy, which resulted in overhedging of jet fuel purchases and related currency transactions. Excluding the impact of overhedging, fuel costs fell in line with the capacity reductions, with a small benefit from the efficiency of new-generation aircraft and a reduced effective price net of hedging.\n\nSupplier costs also fell significantly at each of the operating companies, reflecting the impact of volume-related savings, linked to the significantly lower flying programmes, together with the negotiated cost-reduction initiatives and reductions in discretionary expenditure.\n\nOwnership costs were impacted by the impairment of aircraft and related assets in each operating company, including the early retirement of the Boeing 747-400 fleet at British Airways and the Airbus A340-600 fleet at Iberia, together with other aircraft permanently stood down pending disposal or return to lessors.\n\nOperating margins are much less meaningful than in previous years, given the significant impact of COVID-19, but are included for completeness; each main operating company saw a substantial operating loss in 2020, with cost reductions only able to mitigate part of the fall in revenues.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn response to COVID-19, the Group has agreed to defer 68 aircraft scheduled for delivery over the period 2020 to 2022 and to re-schedule certain pre-delivery payments to aircraft manufacturers. In November 2019, as announced at the IAG Capital Markets Day, it was anticipated capital expenditure would total \u20ac14.2 billion for the period 2020 to 2022. With aircraft deferrals and savings in other capital expenditure, linked to the response to COVID-19, the Group now expects capital expenditure over that period to be below \u20ac7 billion. Further deferrals are under discussion with the aircraft manufacturers.\n\nThe Group did not enter into any new agreements to acquire additional aircraft in 2020, either from aircraft manufacturers or/uni00A0lessors.\n\nIn 2020 the Group took delivery of 34 aircraft, with 19 for British Airways, eight for Iberia, three for Vueling and four for Aer Lingus. As at December 31, 2020 one of these aircraft had yet to enter service and is therefore not included in the 'in service' fleet shown elsewhere in this report. The liquidity impact of the aircraft deliveries in the year was cash-positive, as the value of financing raised exceeded the final delivery payments made to the aircraft manufacturers, due to pre-delivery payments for those aircraft made in previous years, with total aircraft financing proceeds in the year of \u20ac2.2 billion.\n\n| Aircraft deliveries   |   2020 | 2019   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320 family    |     15 | 32     |\n| Airbus A330           |      2 | 3      |\n| Airbus A350           |      7 | 8      |\n| Boeing 777-300        |      4 | -      |\n| Boeing 787-10         |      2 | -      |\n| Embraer E190          |      4 | 2      |\n| Total                 |     34 | 45     |\n\nCapital expenditure for the year was reduced to \u20ac1.9 billion, more than 50 per cent down on the \u20ac4.2 billion anticipated for 2020 in November 2019. Capital expenditure was also lower than the revised projection of \u20ac2.7 billion for the year given in July 2020, mainly due to further aircraft delays, moving approximately \u20ac0.5 billion of aircraft delivery payments and associated financing into 2021.\n\nDespite the reductions made to discretionary capital projects, the Group maintained its programme of cyber-related investments.",

Most of this commitment is denominated in US dollars and includes commitments until 2027 for 121 aircraft including 64 aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, 10 Boeing 787s, 18 Boeing 777s, one Airbus A330, 26 Airbus A350s and two Embraer E190.\n\nThe Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers.

The Group rolled over fuel derivatives, monetised EU Emissions Trading Scheme credits and foreign currency derivatives that resulted in reduced cash outflow in 2020 of approximately \u20ac625 million; deferrals to future years account for approximately 60 per cent of this amount, with the majority due in 2021. Relief was given during the year in respect of the timing of VAT and other payments to the UK's HMRC and to Eurocontrol for regulated overlying charges, although both had reverted to normal terms by the end of the year.\n\nIn quarter 3 a multi-year renewal was signed with American Express, including an upfront payment of approximately \u20ac830 million (\u00a3754 million), with a significant amount being for the pre-purchase of Avios.\n\nTrade receivables were reduced significantly, falling from \u20ac2,255 million (net of the provision for expected credit losses) at/uni00A0December 31, 2019 to \u20ac557 million at the end of 2020. Part of/uni00A0the reduction was due to the contraction in activity, with lower/uni00A0passenger and other revenue yet to be received by the Group, but the reduction was also achieved by ensuring outstanding amounts due from customers and government agencies were paid.\n\nDeferred revenue on ticket sales , which includes loyalty points (Avios), fell \u20ac356 million to \u20ac5,130 million at December 31, 2020; \u20ac4,657 million is included in current liabilities and \u20ac473 million within non-current liabilities, associated with the renewal of the IAG Loyalty contract with American Express. The value of loyalty points (Avios) issued and yet to be recognised in revenue was up \u20ac0.8 billion versus 2019 at \u20ac2.7 billion, reflecting the American Express contract renewal and associated pre-payment, but sales in advance of carriage, related to passenger ticket sales, were down \u20ac1.2 billion versus 2019 at \u20ac2.4 billion. The cash impact of cancelled flights was partially mitigated by customers accepting vouchers for future travel in lieu of a cash refund, with the outstanding value of vouchers as at December 31, 2020 accounting for approximately half of the sales in advance of carriage balance.\n\nDue to COVID-19 British Airways was eligible for refund of tax payments made to HMRC in 2019 and the Group was able to accelerate receipt into 2020, rather than 2021. Together with refunds in Ireland, the impact was to improve cash by approximately \u20ac175 million in 2020.\n\nBritish Airways deferred monthly UK pension contributions that would otherwise have been due in quarter 4, 2020 to the value of \u20ac125 million, together with contributions of \u20ac375 million relating to the first three quarters of 2021. These payments are due to be added to the end of the schedule of deficit recovery contributions, which currently ends in March 2023. British Airways granted to the Trustee of NAPS security over certain property assets in respect of these deferred payments. British Airways has also agreed that it will not make dividend payments to IAG before the end of 2023 and that from 2024 dividends will be matched by a contribution to NAPS of 50 per cent of the dividend paid until the deferred contributions have been paid.\n\n## Funding and debt\n\nIAG's long-term objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital and to provide sustainable returns to shareholders. In November 2018, S+P and Moody's assigned IAG with a long-term investment grade credit rating with stable outlook. Ratings (as at February 25, 2021) are: S&P: BB (3 notch decline), Moody's: Ba2 (2 notch decline), based on the status of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions, together with the expected timing of the recovery of global air traffic.\n\n## Debt and capital\n\nThe Group monitors leverage using net debt to EBITDA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Alternative Performance Measure section for calculation",

        "page_content": "## Debt\n\nDespite some disruption to financial markets in respect of the aviation sector, linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has been able to continue to obtain efficient funding secured against aircraft deliveries. In total 36 aircraft were financed in the year, 4 of which were delivered in 2019, and with 13 involving sale and leaseback transactions, a further 11 direct leases from lessors and 12 on finance lease arrangements. Just two of the aircraft delivered in 2020 had not been financed as at the end of the year, although sale and leaseback transactions for these were agreed and executed in February 2021.\n\nProceeds from sale and leaseback transactions continue to cover substantially all of the Group's aircraft purchase price. An Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETC) funding for $1,005 million (\u20ac823 million) was successfully issued and closed for British Airways in November 2020, with $577 million (\u20ac472 million) drawn down in December in the form of finance leases, with the remainder expected to be drawn in 2021, in line with aircraft deliveries. The issuance comprised a dual-tranche structure achieving a loan-to-value of 75 per cent against an independently appraised value of the aircraft.\n\nIn addition to long-term regular aircraft financing, the Group took steps to boost available liquidity through other lending and facilities. Short-term aircraft-backed financing facilities for British Airways ($750 million, or \u20ac667 million) and Iberia ($228 million, or \u20ac194 million) were secured in the second quarter. These facilities were fully drawn during the year but had been repaid in full by the end of the year, due to the Group's success in securing more efficient long-term financing.\n\nThe Group agreed new non-aircraft debt for each of its main operating companies. In March, British Airways completed its inaugural commercial paper issuance raising net proceeds of \u20ac328 million (\u00a3298 million) using the UK's Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF) with a maturity of 12 months. In April, Iberia and Vueling entered into floating rate syndicated financing agreements for \u20ac750 million and \u20ac260 million respectively, with the funds received in May. These loans are secured by a guarantee of 70 per cent of the amount borrowed from the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial ('ICO') in Spain. There is no amortisation for the first three years and the loans mature in 2025; the loans do not include financial covenants but place some restrictions on the transfer of cash to the rest of the IAG companies. In December, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) approved a \u20ac150 million facility for Aer Lingus with \u20ac75 million drawn down as a loan as at December 31, 2020; this loan also has restrictions regarding transfers of cash, from Aer Lingus to IAG and other Group companies. At the end of/uni00A02020 British Airways announced that it had received commitments for a 5-year Export Development Guaranteed term loan for \u00a32.0 billion underwritten by a syndicate of banks, partially guaranteed (80 per cent) by UK Export Finance (UKEF) and containing some non-financial covenants, including restrictions on cash transfers to IAG. The facility was fully drawn down as a loan in February 2021.\n\nThe debt actions above resulted in total 'Proceeds from borrowings' for the year of \u20ac3,567 million. This includes the drawing down of the short-term aircraft financing facilities above, with the repayment of those facilities during the year shown in 'Repayments of borrowings and lease liabilities'.\n\n## Equity\n\nDuring quarter 3 the Group launched a capital increase by rights issue, which was fully subscribed, with the Group's largest shareholder, Qatar Airways Group subscribing for its pro rated entitlement in full. The capital increase was successfully completed at the start of quarter 4, with gross proceeds of \u20ac2.7 billion received in October. As at December 31, 2020 none of the proceeds from the \u20ac2.7 billion capital increase had been allocated permanently to any of the Group's operating companies. British Airways received a loan from IAG of \u20ac1,645 million and Aer Lingus a loan of \u20ac50 million.\n\n## Liquidity facilities\n\nIn March, British Airways' revolving credit facility (RCF) was extended to June 2021, with a committed amount of $1.38 billion. The Group has secured other credit facilities during the year. At the end of the year committed general credit facilities, including the undrawn amount of the British Airways RCF, were \u20ac0.9 billion. In addition, the Group had committed aircraft financing facilities of \u20ac1.2 billion, which provide guaranteed financing against certain future aircraft deliveries, including the committed proceeds still to be drawn as part of the British Airways EETC issued in November 2020. In total, the Group had \u20ac2.1 billion of committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities as at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Dividends\n\nAs a result of the impact of COVID-19, on April 2, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Group resolved to withdraw the proposal to the subsequent Shareholders' Meeting to pay a final dividend for 2019 of 17 \u20ac cents per share, which would have resulted in a total payment of \u20ac337 million.\n\n## Liquidity and cashflow\n\nTotal liquidity, measured as cash and interest-bearing deposits of \u20ac5,917 million and committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of \u20ac2,142 million, was \u20ac8,059 million at December 31, 2020. Including the \u20ac2.2 billion UKEF debt agreed in December 2020 results in pro forma liquidity of \u20ac10.3 billion.",

2020 benefited from the deferral of deficit contributions in quarter 4.\n\nOf the exceptional charges for discontinuance of hedge accounting in respect of passenger revenue of \u20ac62 million and fuel, oil and emissions costs of \u20ac1,694 million in 2020, \u20ac1,187 million had been paid, leaving \u20ac569 million to be paid in future years, with the majority due in 2021.\n\nSale of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, in addition to the aircraft 13 sale and leaseback transactions discussed under 'Funding' above, includes the disposal of surplus engines and other equipment and property at London Heathrow.\n\nRepayments of borrowings and lease liabilities includes the principal element of ongoing lease payments, together with short-term aircraft financing of \u20ac833 million, which was drawn and fully repaid during the year. There are no IAG bond payments falling due in 2021; based on the share price at December 31, 2020, the remaining \u20ac500 million IAG convertible bond will be due for repayment in November 2022.\n\nThe \u20ac53 million of cash outflow for dividends relates to the Spanish withholding tax in respect of the 2019 interim dividend, as the dividend was paid to shareholders in December 2019 and the related withholding tax was paid to the Spanish tax authorities in January 2020.",

As a result of the pandemic, we were forced to curtail our operations as we navigated continual, fast-changing global travel and quarantine restrictions, and UK lockdowns. During the year we saw a reduction in our flying schedule of around 66 per cent compared to 2019.\n\nI was appointed Chief Executive Officer of British Airways in October 2020. Alex Cruz had led the airline since 2016, as well as steering it through the first seven months of the crisis. I would like to thank Alex for his passion and commitment to the airline's success over the last four years.\n\n## The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe UK Government imposed a ban on all but essential travel between April and June 2020, and as a consequence British Airways operated just 5 per cent of its schedule compared with the same period in 2019.\n\nWhen the first lockdown ended in June, UK Government-imposed travel restrictions remained in place for most destinations. During the summer, as some travel corridors began to open, we re-introduced routes in Europe and further afield where we saw pockets of demand. But with US borders still closed, travel corridors being reviewed on a\n\n## ' In an incredibly difficult year we took decisive action to restructure our business, to enable us to compete in a much-changed industry. '\n\nweekly basis and customer confidence low, we operated just 27 per cent of our schedule between August and October (compared to the same period in 2019), typically our busiest time of the year.\n\nDuring this time, we operated 134 repatriation flights from 21 countries, returning 40,000 Britons to the UK and flew many thousands of tonnes of Personal Protective Equipment to where it was urgently needed.\n\n## Our business\n\nWe took urgent action to restructure the business in the wake of the pandemic. By working with our trade unions, we were able to mitigate redundancies, protect as many jobs as possible and reach agreements across the main areas of the business, including our cabin crew and pilots. By the end of 2020, around 23 per cent of our colleagues had left the airline, the vast majority on a voluntary basis.\n\nWe are extremely grateful for the commitment, dedication and resilience shown by our people throughout this period to ensure the airline remained operating at an extremely difficult and stressful time.\n\nThe Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has helped us financially through the crisis, alongside a \u00a3298 million loan from the Bank of England Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) and a bond issue of over US$1 billion to fund previously committed aircraft deliveries in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. In December 2020 British Airways received commitments for a five-year term-loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u00a32 billion underwritten by a syndicate of banks, partially guaranteed by UK Export Finance (UKEF).\n\n## Keeping colleagues and customers safe\n\nTo protect our customers, crew and build confidence in travel we introduced new COVID-19 safety measures, including new catering designed to minimise contact, sanitising our aircraft from nose-to-tail and requiring customers and crew to wear face masks. In November 2020, industry body Skytrax awarded British Airways four stars for COVID-19 safety.\n\n## Flexibility for customers\n\nWe introduced our Book with Confidence policy, giving customers the option to change their booking date and destination for those travelling up until April 2022, or to cancel it completely and request a voucher for future travel. Customers whose flights were cancelled were able to request a cash refund. In 2020 we issued more than 2.8 million cash refunds and 2 million vouchers for future travel, which can be used right up until April/uni00A02023.\n\n## Testing for travel\n\nSince starting as CEO, I have campaigned for a pre-departure COVID-19 testing regime to re-open air travel. In November we began a trial with American Airlines and the one world alliance for customers travelling from the US to the UK taking three COVID-19 tests, before and after their flight. We hope the results will demonstrate with scientific evidence the essential role that COVID-19 pre-departure testing can play in safely re-starting travel as/uni00A0we wait for vaccines to become widely available.\n\n## Sustainable recovery\n\nWe remain committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In January 2020 we began offsetting carbon emissions on all domestic flights. With our partner Velocys, we achieved planning permission to create the UK's first commercial-scale waste-to-jet fuel plant in Lincolnshire to power our aircraft. In December, we announced a partnership with hydrogen electric aviation company ZeroAvia.\n\nAs a result of the crisis, we retired our entire fleet of 32 Boeing 747 aircraft four years earlier than planned. We welcomed four new Airbus A350 aircraft, two Boeing 787-10s, four Boeing 777-300ERs, two Airbus A321neos and three Airbus A320neos, all of which have significantly superior fuel and CO2 efficiency.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite a very turbulent year I am confident British Airways is in the right shape to emerge as a sustainable airline from this crisis. We are focused on re-opening travel safely, rebuilding our global network, reducing our environmental impact, recognising and rewarding the hard work of our colleagues and continuing to delight our customers with our unique British Airways service.",

The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything and has forced Iberia to reinvent itself, with different challenges arising from one day to the next.\n\nIn April, more than 95 per cent of operations were cancelled, which impacted the flight programme, all ground and flight crews and, most importantly, our customers, with millions of booking changes, vouchers and refunds. We partially recovered the flight schedule over the year, operating just 20 per cent of 2019 capacity in the summer but reaching 40 per cent of 2019 capacity in December 2020.\n\nIberia went into the crisis with a solid cash position as a result of the strong recent performance and the Plan de Futuro initiatives. However, the prolonged lack of revenue and the level of fixed costs within the business led us to take additional measures to ensure the long-term survival of Iberia. The initiatives have focused on three main pillars: cost reduction, liquidity improvement and new financing sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ' In 2020 normality has become extraordinary, and Iberia's adaptability has been put to the test like never before. '\n\nchanges and cancellations, to give our customers as much certainty as possible.\n\n## A more efficient fleet and adaptability\n\nThe pandemic has tested the adaptability of airlines and demanded greater efficiency. Projects such as the Airbus A340-600 fleet retirement have been accelerated. As a result, Iberia currently operates a very young longhaul fleet, made up of Airbus A330 and A350, new-generation aircraft which are more sustainable and technologically advanced than their predecessors.\n\nWe also transformed three Airbus A330 aircraft into cargo-only freighters to take advantage of the increased demand for air cargo, to diversify our sources of income and continue generating activity for our employees while air demand remains suppressed.\n\n## New organisation\n\nI returned to Iberia as CEO in September, replacing Luis Gallego, now IAG's Chief Executive Officer. A new organisation was designed to ensure it is fit for the future and ensure we are poised to respond to it in an appropriate manner.\n\nOur new organisation faces four fundamental challenges: ensuring Iberia is seen as a trusted airline in all our markets; returning to profitability and providing sustainable returns to our shareholders; reinforcing Iberia's presence at our Madrid airport hub; and emphasising the role of the employees as ambassadors of the company.\n\nThese four priorities form our new transformation plan Iberia Next Chapter and they detail the necessary steps we need to take, building on the successful transformation Plan de Futuro. The current situation has presented us with new challenges, and it is time for a new plan, Iberia Next Chapter, to help us emerge from this crisis more competitive than before.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2021 promises to be just as complex as 2020 with air traffic recovery scenarios not expecting recovery to 2019 levels until at least 2023. We will have to continue evolving and adapting to this new reality, just as we have done before.\n\nTo offset the impact of the lack of demand, we implemented cost-saving and containment measures focused on liquidity, by delaying aircraft rental payments, reducing supplier spending and offsetting existing debts. We also agreed additional borrowing facilities including a five-year loan guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) for \u20ac750 million.\n\n## Repatriation, volunteering and special cargo flights\n\nBetween April and June, in coordination with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Iberia operated more than 50 repatriation flights to over 20 international destinations. These flights allowed thousands of people stranded around the world to return home. In addition, from the end of March to mid-June, Iberia operated nearly 100 flights from China carrying back critical medical supplies and Personal Protective Equipment.\n\nOur employees have also made a big impact on our local communities, particularly those affected by the temporary reduction in working hours due to Spain's ERTE ( Expediente de Regulaci\u00f3n Temporal de Empleo ) temporary redundancy scheme, spending time volunteering for organisations that have been on the front line in the fight against COVID-19.\n\n## Building trust in customers\n\nTo generate the security and confidence necessary to stimulate customer demand, we have been focusing on three main areas:\n\nFirstly, reinforcing all safety, hygiene and prevention measures throughout the customer's travel experience, improving processes and adopting necessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures have placed the company among the ten safest airlines in the world against COVID-19, according to the Safe Travel Barometer.\n\nSecondly, we have adopted a flexibility policy that creates peace of mind for customers in case their journey is impacted by COVID-19.\n\nAnd finally, we worked hard to have a stable flight programme, with minimal",

Managing the challenge created by the COVID-19 pandemic has required intense focus and agility, which has been possible thanks to the engagement and dedication of all Vueling employees, who have made significant sacrifices and efforts to ensure the viability of the company. At the same time, the 'new normal' forces us to rethink and prepare for it with a focus on the longterm health and strength of the airline. As we have adapted our network, operation, and organisation to the demands of the current environment, we have also positioned Vueling to emerge better built than before.\n\n## Managing the crisis\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions have drastically affected our capacity and results.\n\nTo manage the crisis, we have focused on four priorities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' As we navigated an uncharted environment, we focused on both the present and the future. '\n\n## 1. Protecting the health of our employees\n\n- and customers. We have ensured the strict enforcement of all applicable safety protocols, from boarding, to in-flight, to deplaning. Our aircraft continue to employ powerful HEPA air filtration systems and are cleaned according to new, rigorous procedures, and use of protective masks is mandatory on all flights. We have offered free COVID-19 testing to our employees, and we have actively engaged with authorities to ensure development of further measures to facilitate safe travel.\n\n## 2. Detecting and stimulating demand.\n\nWe/uni00A0have taken advantage of opportunities to generate business. For example, in November we further unbundled our basic product with the launch of the Guaranteed Cabin Bag service. We have also adapted our capacity to changing demand. After the first wave of COVID-19, we rapidly increased capacity, reaching 50 per cent of 2019 levels in August. In the long term, we remain focused on market leadership through network and schedule depth in key markets. However, in the current environment, we have prioritised cash preservation and generation, ensuring flights are cash-accretive. We have continued to focus on our Spanish, French, and Italian main markets, such as Spanish domestic routes connecting the peninsula with the islands. We also have demonstrated agility to adapt to changing market conditions, testing new markets where appropriate.\n\n- 3. Managing our cash flow. We have managed cash flow and sources of financing to ensure necessary robustness in the short and medium term. We have maximised working capital by, for example, renegotiating delivery and pre-delivery payment calendars and improving supplier and rental payment conditions. In April we entered into a syndicated financing agreement for \u20ac260 million, 70 per cent guaranteed through the Spanish Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) programme.\n\n4. Managing cost. Vueling has a flexible model with a high proportion of variable costs that were successfully adjusted in line with capacity. We have removed non-essential costs, especially in marketing, IT, and external services. We have pursued reductions of fixed fleet costs by, for example, negotiating power by-thehour contracts. We mitigated fixed employee costs while preserving jobs by accessing Spain's ERTE and reaching an agreement with Vueling labour representatives that allows employee costs to be aligned with the level of company activity, potentially until the end of 2021.\n\nWe look forward to the subsidence of COVID-19, supported by vaccines, improved testing schemes and effective coordination among European institutions. Until such time, we remain focused on managing the/uni00A0crisis.\n\n## Shaping the new Vueling: Vueling/uni00A0Transform\n\nWe believe we must emerge from this crisis in an even more competitive shape. In partnership with the new IAG Transformation Office, Vueling has defined a balanced portfolio of transformation initiatives, driving improvements to revenue, cost, and employee and customer experiences. These are focused on three areas: international market development, low-cost leadership, and digital enablement. Our sustainability programme also continues at pace, to reduce carbon emissions, waste, and noise. For example, in 2020 we removed all plastic from our on-board customer service.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged Vueling, and indeed our whole industry, like nothing ever before. I am proud of how our team has risen to the task of managing the crisis, to ensure Vueling remains healthy and strong in the long term. In 2021, we will maintain this focus on both managing the crisis and shaping the new Vueling.",

We had ambitious plans for the year ahead, enabled by a strong balance sheet.\n\nThe unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on the sector was particularly pronounced in Ireland.\n\nEurocontrol data for air traffic activity shows Ireland down approximately 80 per cent versus Europe down 60 per cent in 2020. The US - a key strategic market for Aer Lingus - was effectively closed. As a result, Aer Lingus operated less than five per cent capacity compared with 2019 for a substantial period of the second quarter of 2020, and due to continued lack of demand in its home market, that level remained at close to 25 per cent for the second half of 2020.\n\nIn October, I was appointed Interim CEO following Sean Doyle's appointment as CEO of British Airways. Sean made a lasting and positive contribution to Aer Lingus during his tenure as CEO and he expertly led the airline through the first seven months of the crisis.

We effectively managed our costs and those control measures had a significant impact in slowing the amount of cash leaving the business, such as encouraging customers to opt for vouchers rather than refunds when flights were cancelled.\n\n## Delivering vital Personal Protective Equipment\n\nIn March, we were contacted by the Irish Government for advice on how to transport critical supplies from China. Something of this scale would normally take months to set up. Our people rose to the challenge demonstrating immense determination and commitment and delivered the operation in a matter of days. The successful completion of 259 Dublin - Beijing return flights importing vital Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Health Service Executive of Ireland was a considerable achievement. Completed over a three-month period, the operation was the largest cargo operation by air in the history of the Irish state.\n\n## Reassuring our customers\n\nCommitment by our people was also key to the successful introduction of extensive new safety procedures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Measures include the mandatory wearing of face masks and a significantly enhanced cleaning process. All Aer Lingus Airbus aircraft are fitted with HEPA air filtration technology as standard.\n\nWe introduced a new Book with Confidence policy which allows all\n\ncustomers travelling with Aer Lingus to change their travel dates free of charge, and as many times as they wish, up to two hours before they travel.\n\n## Opportunity in a crisis\n\nWe continue to look at opportunities for our business and in August, we announced the opening of a new Aer Lingus Regional base with the launch of six routes operated by Stobart Air at Belfast City Airport, five of which are currently in operation.\n\nTowards the end of 2020, Aer Lingus was/uni00A0granted antitrust immunity by the US Department of Transportation to enable the airline to join the transatlantic joint business between American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and Finnair. The addition of Aer Lingus' Dublin hub and its complementary network will significantly enhance customers' travel options and/uni00A0add/uni00A0new European destinations not currently served by any other transatlantic joint business.\n\nThroughout this most tumultuous of years, the resilience demonstrated by colleagues across the airline has been exemplary. Our people have displayed extraordinary commitment in an ever-changing and unprecedented environment. Their dedication ensured the success of various charter flight operations, the introduction of new safety measures, our response to the ever-changing schedule and its impact for customers; and has laid the groundwork to optimise opportunities in the future.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs the global economy emerges from the COVID-19 crisis, this importance of facilitating international connectivity for our island nation, and through our island between North America and Europe will again be paramount. Our value carrier business model means that there will be significant opportunities for the airline, and we are well positioned to return to delivering compelling results for IAG, our stakeholders and for the Irish economy.",

On top of this, IAG Connect uses the .air platform to provide in-flight services including entertainment, customer service, retail and loyalty via portal and seatback interfaces.\n\nDuring 2020, the IAG Connect management was transitioned to IAG Loyalty to allow it to further enhance customer relevancy of its products as well as provide access to an extensive partnership network. This will be used to\n\nIAG Connect\n\nextend the value that the platform can create for customers across IAG airlines in the future. IAG Connect has continued to roll out Wi-Fi connectivity across the Group's fleet in 2020 and now covers 75 per cent of the Group's aircraft.\n\nVast improvements have also been made to/uni00A0IAG Connect's processes to speed up delivery of new and enhanced products and/uni00A0services. IAG Connect's plans for 2021 include new products and features already/uni00A0in development to further add value/uni00A0to customers.\n\nIn November, Openskies, the operator of LEVEL France, completed a consultation process on its proposed cessation of operations and the development of an Employment Safeguard Plan. Openskies has ceased its activities.\n\nDuring 2020, LEVEL Spain has taken significant steps to improve key value drivers in digital distribution and ancillary merchandising and continues to operate longhaul flights from Barcelona.\n\nImportant milestones have been achieved to increase LEVEL Spain's distribution in away markets and to improve product relevance, such as the enablement of the connectivity with Vueling on flylevel.com. LEVEL's unbundled fare distribution was activated on all the channels to improve its market share.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nLEVEL is now focused on creating value for the Group from its longhaul operation in Barcelona. Together with Vueling, it will reinforce the ambition of Barcelona as an IAG hub, with the aim to improve the capture of connecting traffic.\n\nAn agile network planning process has been implemented to adjust capacity rapidly to the situation and to any change in environment.\n\nThere will be a continued focus on direct distribution with the launch of a full reviewed booking flow with new pricing and merchandising functionalities, and the implementation of a new Customer Lifecycle improving upsell and repetition.\n\nThe new Online Contact Centre, with reinforced omnichannel capabilities, will become the lever to improve customer service at the lowest cost.",

'\n\nAn integral part of the IAG Platform, GBS evolved its remit in 2020, to provide creative and innovative solutions to drive sustainable transformation in providing finance, procurement, IT and digital services to all operating companies across IAG. Each operating company benefits from the GBS centralised model, driving efficiencies, automation and economies of scale.\n\nDuring the pandemic, GBS quickly pivoted to further focus on cash preservation and contract renegotiations to support the Group, while continuing to drive additional enhancements and efficiencies in process automation, supplier management, common systems and operational resilience. In addition, the onboarding of new services continued, including activities within airport operations and the transfer of IT colleagues into GBS.\n\nI was appointed CEO of IAG GBS early in 2020. A new leadership team was also introduced that reflects representation from all key areas of the GBS business, together with IAG Tech.\n\nWith a diverse workforce spread across four countries, GBS will continue to further harmonise processes; drive automation; strengthen the sustainable supply chain; develop and deliver new consolidated services and innovative solutions in 2021, supporting the Group's day-to-day operations and long-term business strategy and transformation.\n\n## Finance Operations\n\nAs the hub of working capital activity for the Group, GBS was ideally placed to rapidly establish additional support to provide a constant overview of working capital during the global pandemic. Teams were pivoted to focus on core requirements and new services across IAG, demonstrating the swift responsiveness, scalability and flexibility of all centralised services provided by GBS.\n\nGBS Finance Operations continues to transform and consolidate migrated functions through the optimisation of processes, automation and a constant review of insourcing or outsourcing (make versus buy) via its onshore, nearshore and offshore model.\n\n## Procurement\n\nGroup Procurement led a comprehensive zero-based supplier review with all operating companies, using taskforces to adjust the supply chain in response to the challenges of the pandemic.\n\nWith a large proportion of flight operations grounded and uncertainty as to when travel would recover, the immediate focus of Group Procurement was right-sizing the supply chain for the future and supporting cash preservation. Supplier spend initiatives delivered a combined cash benefit of \u20ac2 billion (excluding the impact of volume reductions) across the Group in 2020. These initiatives included securing the waiver of minimum contractual commitments; deferral of cash payments; extension of payment terms; cancellation of committed CAPEX spend; temporary discounts; and the removal of costs. In parallel, Group Procurement worked with the operating companies to move fixed\n\ncosts to a variable basis, where appropriate.\n\nPPE equipment was procured and delivered to protect the Group's customers and employees, and further improvements were made to aircraft and lounge cleaning services.\n\nFinally, Group Procurement maintained its commitment to our Corporate Social Responsibility policies and launched the updated Supplier Code of Conduct to all our active suppliers, setting out clear guidelines and expectations for our suppliers and building on the Group's commitment to sustainable growth.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nGBS will continue to focus on driving sustainable transformation across the Group by creating and delivering innovative centralised solutions for all operating companies. Further growth will come from leveraging the GBS platform and onboarding additional services from across the Group, driving synergies and streamlining new solutions through automation tools and the optimal mix of onshore, nearshore and offshore work.\n\nFinance operations will target the automation of 40 per cent of processes by the end of 2021; determine and select the right long-term suppliers and leverage our insights from around the Group to deliver synergies and best-in-class working capital management.\n\nGroup Procurement will continue the in-depth restructure of the cost base to optimise unit costs; partner with suppliers who share our values and ways of working; continue to manage supplier performance; and proactively monitor any potential supplier risks to mitigate emerging issues.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Delivering through the pandemic\n\nLynne Embleton Chief Executive Officer of IAG Cargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' This year has tested our resilience, teamwork and problem-solving as we adapted our business. '\n\n## Market overview\n\nThe cargo industry was dominated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. International air cargo capacity (market supply) contracted sharply, down 24.1 per cent, a consequence of the cessation of passenger flights initially to China and then globally.\n\nMarket demand was also negatively impacted; production shutdowns and supply chain disruptions had a severe impact on global trade. In 2020 international cargo tonnes kilometres (CTKs) were down 11.8 per cent versus 2019. However, the imbalance created from market supply decreasing at a faster rate than demand resulted in significantly higher yields.\n\nDespite the significant disruption to our capacity, IAG Cargo delivered revenues of \u20ac1,306 million, an increase of 16.9 per cent on 2019.\n\n## Customer focus\n\nAs passenger aircraft were grounded, our teams adapted to ensure IAG Cargo continued to play a crucial role in supporting global trade and the movement of essential goods.\n\nWithout a freighter fleet, we rapidly developed a network of scheduled cargo-only flights using the Group's passenger aircraft. Passenger aircraft vary in belly hold capacity and in their cost of flying. Only a portion of the Group's fleet, such as the Boeing 787s, Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s are economical for cargoonly flying. We identified markets most impacted by the reduction in air cargo supply which could sustain the yields required to fly cargo-only services. Our first routes included New York, Chicago and Toronto. The focus of cargo-only flying was to ensure cash positive contribution for the airlines and the Group. Cargo opportunities were increased by removing seats from five passenger aircraft and obtaining regulatory approvals to load cargo in the passenger cabins.\n\nWe also established a charter team to develop capacity solutions for customers and governments. During the year we operated 1,057 charters, including over 750 critical supply operations for the British, Irish and Spanish authorities.\n\nAs lockdowns and travel restrictions change, IAG Cargo continues to work closely with the Group's airlines to build a network of destinations. This consists of both cargo-only flying and co-sponsored routes, which would not be viable based on either cargo or passenger revenues alone.\n\n## A challenging year for our people\n\nFor many of the team, 2020 was a demanding yet fulfilling year, requiring teamwork, problem-solving and creativity to navigate new challenges against the backdrop of the changing external environment. The dedication and talent of our people was highly evident.\n\nHowever, it was also a difficult year. It was a particular challenge to maintain operational performance in the face of rapidly changing plans and the unpredictable resource levels associated with COVID-19 related absence. Our people were also affected by furlough, the extended period of working from home and, in the operation, introduction and evolution of COVID-19 secure procedures in the workplace.\n\nIn October we completed a management restructure to simplify the organisation and reduce costs whilst rebuilding teams with the talent and experience to grow IAG Cargo in the future.\n\nWe also worked closely with British Airways management in their consultation with their London Heathrow Cargo employees. Our aim was to secure modern and flexible working practices required to improve customer delivery. Although there/uni00A0was industrial action, an important agreement in principle was reached to/uni00A0achieve structural change and cost/uni00A0savings.\n\n## Conclusion: delivering for today and preparing for tomorrow\n\nIAG Cargo has been successful in maintaining a broad network and proposition for cargo customers throughout the pandemic.\n\nOur strategic pillars of deliver, transform and grow still hold. Whilst we had a strong focus on cost reduction, we continued to invest in the resilience of our business, including moving cargo revenue management and booking systems to the cloud.\n\n2020 was a remarkable year. With the world's focus on health, we moved large quantities of PPE, sanitiser, ventilators and COVID-19 testing kits alongside our regular movement of food, medicines, high-tech, and parts for industry.\n\nLooking ahead into 2021, air cargo will be a key driver in global economic recovery. With world-class Constant Climate and cold-chain facilities, IAG Cargo will continue to play its part in the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. We also look forward to offering our customers a further expansion in our network.",

'\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG Loyalty continues to provide comprehensive services to all airlines as the centre of excellence for loyalty for the Group. I was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman early in the year following the departure of Andrew Crawley. I would like to thank Drew for his leadership and vision in the initial stages of the loyalty transformation.\n\nOur focus on driving loyalty through increasing customer benefit and stronger engagement has continued to progress this year, delivering, for example, the full roll-out of new low-cash redemption options, from as little as \u00a31 plus Avios on shorthaul and \u00a3100 plus Avios on longhaul. We have also reached commercial agreements on several new partnerships, including a new banking relationship in Spain with Santander that has already successfully launched.\n\nOur transition to a single loyalty platform for the Group now on course for completion in 2021 - delivering synergies for the Group and providing the platform from which to accelerate our growth.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic impact\n\nThe levels of Avios issued and redeemed significantly reduced during 2020 which has had a negative impact on financial performance.\n\nManagement actions have been effective to reduce overheads by over 25 per cent through recruitment freezes, senior leader salary reductions and closure of our Central London office space. Our capital expenditure plans reduced by 50 per cent through programme deferrals.\n\nOur teams have adapted to new ways of working, leveraging on the progress we had made as a business with collaborative tools well before the pandemic arrived. We successfully converted our loyalty contact centre colleagues to homeworking by mid-March, enabling us to continue to serve customers through the prolonged period of travel uncertainty.\n\nWe have completed a restructure to ensure that our organisation is fit for the challenge ahead as we continue our role of driving revenue and cash into the Group and enhancing our customer proposition.\n\n## Key achievements\n\nDespite the effects of the pandemic, IAG Loyalty remained profitable and our business model continued to generate significant levels of cash, in particular the renegotiation of key Finance Partner contracts. The extension of our longstanding relationship with American Express generated a \u00a3750 million cash injection in the third quarter of 2020, highlighting significant confidence and value in our loyalty business model.\n\nWe have continued to roll out new products for customers. We have witnessed strong redemption demand from our customers where pockets of demand have arisen, particularly in the UK during the summer when travel corridors opened. Our lowest cash redemption options are proving exceptionally popular with customers and the concept is now available on British Airways longhaul flights.\n\nWe also invested in the development of our employee engagement products to support the wellbeing and engagement of our team during the pandemic, such as 'Get Active with Avios'. The success of the initiative has led to us explore new opportunities for these products with our/uni00A0partners.\n\nWe slowed our investment in the development of our Global Loyalty Platform and now expect Iberia and British Airways to migrate during 2021. We have reformed our capital investment plans and will continue to increase our investment in our platform capability as we see the air issuance side of the business recover.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nLooking ahead we will accelerate our transition into a data-led organisation, applying our agile ways of working to develop new products at speed for customers and airlines. We have recently restructured our management team to accelerate our speed of development, with the creation of a new position of Chief Data Officer and the appointment of a new Chief People Officer with experience of digital transformations in the retail sector.\n\nWe have a number of new high-profile partnerships launching in 2021. The recently announced UK partnership with Nectar and Sainsbury's will give us a greater level of traction with customers on their grocery spend, supported by the provision of in-store brand presence. We are also due to release new partnerships and technology for customers' banking requirements, both at home and abroad.",

'\n\nIAG Tech delivered over 300 different COVID-19 initiatives in less than two months in response to the Coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 and further capabilities were deployed throughout the remainder of the year. We had three main priorities:\n\nTo ensure our customers have a world class experience throughout the customer journey. We enhanced the .com platforms to support bookings and amendments; enabled voucher refunds; implemented new communication channels such as WhatsApp, Amazon Alexa and Google voice assistant; improved disruption management; increased capacity in the call centres; and made modifications to our customer relationship management solution. The safety of our customers remained a top priority as we invested in contactless technologies throughout the journey including changes at check-in, lounges, departure gates and on board.\n\nWe are now investing in systems to support boarded passenger health data, testing and vaccination history.\n\nTo enable our employees to work efficiently. We enabled the switch to remote working with enhanced communication and collaboration, but ensuring the necessary controls remained effective. Other changes included wider deployment of automated workflow; enhanced operational planning; changes to pilot and crew systems; and, use of data and analytics to provide unique insights.\n\nTo support the Group's financial performance. We delivered capabilities to increase revenues such as additional ancillary sales; drove cost optimisation using robotic process automation; and, worked with our supply chain partners to deliver a 30 per cent reduction in operating costs of the IT/Digital estate and a 25 per cent improvement in project and product team efficiency.\n\nHowever, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we deferred nonbusiness critical investments so we have not addressed as much of the technology obsolescence and risks as we had originally planned but, importantly, we maintained our cyber security investments to deliver a 'defence in depth' strategy and improve our capability across the five NIST framework stages: identifying, protecting, detecting, responding and recovering from attacks. We strengthened our cyber security leadership team, increased the breadth and depth of our in-house team, and introduced a new partner to run our security operations centre. We increased awareness of cyber security through training, phishing campaigns and simulations at all levels in the organisation.\n\nWe continued the Hangar 51 programme to identify innovative use of technology to solve business challenges. In 2020 we addressed contactless travel, connected operations, new products and services, sustainability, loyalty, cyber security, and smart working. With applications received throughout August we held a 'virtual pitch week' in October. The selected partners entered a ten-week accelerator phase with capability demonstrations to be held in February/uni00A02021.\n\nWe slowed down the transformation of the IAG Tech organisation as we furloughed staff and focused on the critical COVID-19\n\ninvestments. However, at the end of 2020 I/uni00A0completed the appointment of a new Technology senior leadership team and we are currently finalising the appointment of the extended leadership team. We have now restarted the transformation journey to 'become the very best at what we do' and we have completed the design of a new operating model covering our organisation structure, governance, processes and tools underpinned by modern ways of working which will be implemented in the first half of 2021. At the heart of this strategy is a highly skilled, motivated, engaged and empowered Technology community.\n\nIn addition to completing the transformation of the IAG Tech organisation, our focus in 2021 includes delivering the critical technology to support the business transformation plans and COVID-19 pandemic response; drive further improvements in performance and stability of core systems; and to deliver the IAG Tech business plans.\n\n2020 was an extremely challenging year for all of us and I am incredibly proud of IAG Tech's achievements during the year, which have put us in a strong position for/uni00A02021.",

'\n\nWe have always been clear that the aviation industry must play a full part in tackling climate change, and we remain as committed as ever to leading that effort.\n\nIn 2019, we became the first airline group to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Throughout 2020 we worked hard to engage the wider industry with this goal, leading coalitions around the world both to create net zero roadmaps and to encourage others to adopt similar/uni00A0targets.\n\nFor example, in February we were instrumental in supporting the UK aviation sector to develop a roadmap and a net zero target through the Sustainable Aviation group. In/uni00A0September, we actively supported the one world alliance, which includes 13 airlines accounting for some 20\n\nper cent of global aviation, to commit to the same 2050 goal.\n\nWe were active through Airlines for Europe and the Air Transport Action Group in developing roadmaps for airlines in Europe and globally. We are also working with partners to secure a net zero target for the global industry at the 2022 general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.\n\nWe were first in our industry to sign up to/uni00A0the UN Climate Ambition Alliance and the Race to Zero campaign, and are proud to be one of ten/uni00A0global companies recognised for our/uni00A0actions at/uni00A0the UN Climate Ambition summit in December, which marked the/uni00A0fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate/uni00A0Agreement.\n\nAcross the Group, our 30-year decarbonisation plan continued to make great progress. We sped up the retirement of Boeing 747s and Airbus A340s due to COVID-19, invested in new-generation aircraft, and British Airways partnered with ZeroAvia on developing commercial hydrogen flights.\n\nOperationally, we continued to innovate, using special software to identify fuelsaving opportunities and investing in the i6 Group fuel management software company. Investment in sustainable fuels continued too, with our groundbreaking Altalto waste-to-jet fuel plant in the UK securing planning permission and a new\n\ndeal backing a pioneering Lanzajet alcohol-to-jet fuel plant in the USA.\n\nMeanwhile, IAG became a founding member of the Coalition for Negative Emissions, which is advocating for policy support to advance greenhouse gas removal technology. I'm pleased to report that,/uni00A0through our Hangar 51 accelerator programme, eight of our business units/uni00A0are/uni00A0now partnering with environmental/uni00A0innovators.\n\nSustainability is not just about climate, of course, and we were busy on other fronts too in 2020. We made important improvements to our sustainability governance systems, in data collection, procurement and risk management. We also launched initiatives to support and enhance the wellbeing of our employees.\n\nFrom the start of 2021, a new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility sub-committee of the Board will meet quarterly to help us maintain and build on our sustainability leadership. This year we will carry out an in-depth materiality review with our stakeholders, and waste management and key social issues will be priority areas for the Group.\n\nWe will be doing more to engage with our employees, who will have critical roles to play in the transformation of the Group to ensure its sustainability and long-term resilience.\n\nAs you read the pages that follow, I hope you can see that we understand just how important sustainability is to the communities we serve, our customers, employees and investors.\n\nWe have always tried to lead the way on sustainability, often with great success. Even in these difficult times, our commitment to do so remains undiminished.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman",

IAG/uni00A0is committed to minimising its/uni00A0environmental impact and improving its social impact, whilst executing/uni00A0on Group strategy, and delivering best practices in both programmes and processes. IAG also aspires to drive improvements in the sustainability performance of the global aviation/uni00A0industry.\n\nIAG's sustainability strategy is aligned to IAG's three strategic priorities, as demonstrated in the diagram to the right.\n\nProgress against the vision is measured against five strategic aims:\n\n- 1  Clear and ambitious targets relating to IAG's most material issues.\n- 2 Low-carbon transition pathways embedded in business strategy.\n- 3 Management incentives aligned to delivering a low-carbon transition plan.\n- 4 Leadership in carbon disclosures.\n- 5 Accelerating progress in sustainable aviation fuels, future aircraft and low carbon technologies.\n\nTo support these ambitions, IAG's core business processes embed consideration of sustainability issues. Three-year business plans, one-year financial plans, procurement and financial approvals all address climate and sustainability impacts. Assessments of climate-related risks are integrated into an interdisciplinary Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. Carbon prices are incorporated into fleet investment\n\ndecisions.\n\nIn 2020, IAG implemented new management incentives explicitly linked to climate targets. These incentives were agreed by IAG's Management Committee, Remuneration Committee and Board in 2019, resulting in 60 of the most senior executives across the Group, including the IAG Chief Executive Officer, having a proportion of their annual incentives linked to achievement of annual carbon intensity targets. The 2020 annual incentive plan was cancelled due to COVID-19 but the intention is to reinstate it for 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExternal recognition of leadership and progress in 2020 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Luis Gallego was the only aviation CEO invited to speak at the global UN Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020\n- \u00b7 Global winner of Sustainability Strategy to Achieve Net Zero award, from the Institute of Environmental Assessment and Management (IEMA);\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a B overall rating in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) climate change questionnaire, receiving A grades for governance, targets, emissions\n\nreduction initiatives and value chain engagement.

This materiality assessment was facilitated by the UK charitable trust Business in the Community (BITC) as an independent third party.\n\nThe assessment included workshops, stakeholder interviews, benchmarking against external materiality frameworks and the production of an IAG-specific materiality matrix. External stakeholders included investors, corporate customers, suppliers, NGOs and government. Sixteen material sustainability issues were identified and are listed to the right. IAG's most significant material issue is climate change. Four UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 -5, 7, 8 and 13 - were identified as priority areas to support, amongst nine SDGs in total.\n\nHere, material issues are grouped into the categories of Principles of Governance, Planet and People and Prosperity, to align with best practice indicated by the 2020 World Economic Forum report on 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism'.\n\nThese material issues align with the issues identified by IATA and GRI 2 for the wider airline sector. The nine SDGs align with those identified by IATA and UK trade association Sustainable Aviation (SA).\n\nWater consumption, biodiversity and light pollution are not currently assessed as material for IAG. These assessments are based on the small scale of impacts in these areas, and ongoing conversations with our stakeholders. Light pollution was not assessed during the 2017 materiality assessment as it was not identified as material by any key stakeholders. IAG does not have specific risk provisions, targets or guarantees related to these non-material issues.\n\n## IAG material issues identified\n\nIcons indicate alignment with UN SDGs\n\n## Principles of Governance\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance with legislation and regulation\n- \u00b7 Supply chain management\n- \u00b7 Carbon pricing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Planet\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change 3\n- \u00b7 Energy use\n- \u00b7 Waste 4\n- \u00b7 Noise\n- \u00b7 Air quality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Prosperity\n\n- \u00b7 Local economic impacts\n- \u00b7 Customer satisfaction\n- \u00b7 Innovation, research and development\n- \u00b7 Financial performance 5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity and equality\n- \u00b7 Community engagement and charitable support\n- \u00b7 Employee satisfaction\n- \u00b7 Talent management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The UN identified 17 SDGs in total, for all sectors to work towards by 2030 in order to 'end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere.'\n- 2  Global Reporting Initiative.\n- 3  Including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fleet modernisation, fuel efficiency and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).\n- 4  Including food waste.\n- 5  Short-term investor returns and long-term financial sustainability.

Sustainability governance\n\n## GRI 102-46, 102-48\n\nThe IAG Board provides oversight and direction for sustainability programmes, and the IAG Management Committee provides the key forum for reviewing and challenging these programmes and setting their strategic direction.\n\nSustainability programmes across all operating companies and support functions are coordinated at Group level. IAG's sustainability strategy sets out the ambition and the wider context of these programmes. This strategy covers Group policies and objectives, governance structure, risk management, strategy and targets on material issues, sustainability performance indicators, and communications and stakeholder engagement plans. Each individual operating company within the Group has a distinct sustainability programme that is aligned with the Group strategy.\n\nGroup-wide policies relevant to sustainability include the Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct, and specific policies on Sustainability, Modern Slavery, Anti-Corruption and Bribery, Equal Opportunities, and Selection and Diversity. All of these have been approved by the Board of Directors. IAG will review the suite of sustainability-related policies in 2021 and update the sustainability section of the IAG website to reflect any changes.\n\nIn 2020, IAG strengthened its sustainability governance. A Sustainability Steering Group, comprised of representatives from each operating company, was established and meets quarterly to provide oversight of our environmental and social initiatives and reporting. A SAF Steering Group and People Working Group were established to report into this steering group. The IAG Sustainability Network held monthly calls rather than bi-annual meetings and representation was expanded to all operating companies.\n\nIn 2021 a Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Board subcommittee will provide dedicated oversight of the Group's sustainability programme and a link between operating company management committees and the IAG Board. The 2021 governance structure is shown on the previous page and will enhance the rigour and oversight applied to sustainability initiatives and the level of feedback and challenge received.\n\nIndividual operating companies also continue to strengthen their environmental assessment and management. In 2020, British Airways and Vueling achieved Stage 1 certification for the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) 1 management system in 2020 and have begun working towards Stage 2. Aer Lingus and Iberia are working towards Stage 1 certification in 2021. To date, 12 airlines worldwide have achieved IEnvA Stage 1 certification.\n\n## Reporting standards\n\nThe full contents of this sustainability report are included in the IAG NonFinancial Information Statement, which is third-party verified to limited assurance and in line with ISAE3000 2 (Revised)/uni00A0standards.\n\nIAG aligns sustainability reporting with current and emerging disclosure standards to ensure the Group discloses relevant and meaningful data on sustainability performance.\n\nThis includes compliance with obligations under EU Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting and its transposition in the UK and Spain, and the 2018 UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) regulation. IAG voluntarily aligns reporting with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidance, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the IATA Airlines Reporting Handbook. IAG supported IATA and the GRI to develop the IATA handbook.\n\nThis report has been prepared in reference to GRI standards. Criteria for choosing specific GRI standards are based on compliance with Spanish Law 11/2018 and material issues. In cases where alignment was not possible, other standards aligned to airline industry guidance or internal frameworks were used. These are described in relevant sections.\n\nA table showing alignment with external frameworks and GRI standards is included at the end of this sustainability section.\n\n## Data governance\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the scope of environment performance data includes all IAG airlines, subsidiaries and cargo operations over which IAG has operational control. This scope is consistent with environment-related policies and KPIs. LEVEL (except jet fuel/uni00A0data), IAG Loyalty and IAG GBS functions are not in scope for/uni00A0environmental reporting as the environmental impacts of these/uni00A0business units are not material, but are in scope of policies and KPIs.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, workforce and supply chain data include all IAG operating companies and support functions that are wholly or majority-owned.\n\nScope 1 emissions data related to intraEuropean flights is subject to further verification for compliance with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). British Airways emissions data is typically verified again, to reasonable assurance standards, within six months of the year end.\n\nIn cases where full year data was not available, estimates have been applied based on business forecasts and data from prior months. Internal governance is in place to ensure that any estimations made are robust.\n\nAny restatements are indicated next to relevant metrics with reasons provided.",

Supply chain governance and management\n\n## GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2, Supports SDG 12\n\nIAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) manages interactions with suppliers on behalf of the Group. During 2020, IAG GBS focused on minimising the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and drove further consolidation of the number of active suppliers from 27,033 in 2019 to 22,947 in 2020. This consolidation enables IAG GBS to focus more attention on building strategic partnerships.\n\nIAG GBS has a dedicated Procurement Sustainability Programme which consists of four key aspects relating to the supply chain:\n\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Risk screening\n- \u00b7 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Audits\n- \u00b7 Joint programmes to promote sustainability initiatives\n\nIn September 2020, IAG GBS launched a new Group-wide Supplier Code of Conduct and issued this to the existing supply chain. This Code clarifies the standards of behaviour expected from suppliers working with any part of the business and emphasises the importance of sustainability. It has also been integrated into the supplier onboarding process. IAG will only work with businesses which share our standards and ways of working.\n\nAs a minimum, all suppliers undergo bi-annual screening for any legal, social, environmental and financial risks. In 2020, 1,043 suppliers received red flags on compliance issues during their bi-annual screening and 35 business-critical suppliers were highlighted to the operating companies in daily risk alerts. The Procurement and Compliance Teams assess any suppliers that are identified as having potentially higher levels of risk and implement a mitigation plan where necessary. Any issues are flagged to the risk owners within IAG to jointly take appropriate action.\n\nIAG GBS carries out in-depth supplier audits as part of the Group's commitment to sustainability; these audits are based on potential geographical and procurement category risk. They are performed by independent inspectors with CSR expertise using the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) methodology. In 2020, 25 audits were completed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with eight postponed until 2021. Of the audits carried out, 78 points were identified that required minor improvements in health and safety standards, and suppliers have implemented corrective actions.\n\n|   Year | Total number of  suppliers   | Suppliers screened   | Suppliers with  additional compliance  assessment   | Critical suppliers under  regular risk monitoring   |   Independent CSR  audits in year |\n|--------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|   2020 | 22,947                       | 22,947               | 1,818                                               | 35                                                  |                                25 |\n|   2019 | 27,033                       | 18,369               | 2,912                                               | n/a                                                 |                                28 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, joint programmes are in place with key suppliers to drive sustainable innovation and identify new ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and waste. Programmes include the continued development of SAF and carbon removal technology, as well as initiatives to use environmentally friendly packaging in lounges and inflight products.\n\nIn 2021, IAG GBS will continue to further consolidate and permanently right-size the Group supply chain with no more than 15,000 suppliers across all operating companies; pivoting the business to focus more on key partnerships in order to improve supply chain performance; and drive specific projects to deliver upon IAG's sustainability commitments.",

Ethics and integrity\n\n## GRI 102-16, 102-17, 205-1, 205-2, 205-3\n\nAll Directors and employees are expected to act with integrity and in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they operate.\n\nIAG's Group Code of Conduct, which is approved by the Board, sets out the general guidelines that govern the conduct of all Directors and employees of the Group when carrying out their duties in their business and professional relationships. Training and communications activities are carried out for Directors, employees and third parties on a regular basis to maintain awareness and understanding of the principles that govern the conduct of the Group.\n\nIf any employee has a concern about unethical behaviour or organisational integrity, they are encouraged to first speak with their manager or a member of the Legal, Compliance or Human Resources teams. Similarly, suppliers are encouraged to contact their primary contact within the business. IAG maintains Speak Up channels provided by independent third-party providers, Safecall and Ethicspoint, where concerns can be raised on an anonymous basis. These Speak Up channels are available to members of staff as well as suppliers, with information on how to access published in the Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct respectively.\n\nThe IAG Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Speak Up channels on an annual basis. This annual review considers the volume of reports by category; timeliness of follow-up; process and responsibility for follow-up; emerging themes and lessons; and any issues raised of significance to the financial statements or other areas of compliance.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 193 Speak Up reports were received compared with 282 in 2019. This decrease is believed to be largely due to the slowdown in business activity and furloughing of staff brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reports concerned issues relating to employment matters (63 per cent), dishonest behaviour/reputation (17 per cent), health and safety (18 per cent) and regulatory matters (2 per cent). Of the dishonest behaviour/reputation reports, none related to corruption matters versus two reports in 2019. All reports were followed up and investigated where appropriate.\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-money laundering\n\nIAG and its operating companies do not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption. This is made clear in our Group Code of Conduct and supporting policies which are available to all Directors and employees. Our anti-bribery policy statement is also set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nEach Group operating company has a Compliance Department responsible for managing the anti-bribery programme in their business. The compliance teams from across the Group meet regularly through Working Groups and Steering Groups, under the leadership of the IAG Group Compliance Director, and annually they conduct a review of bribery risks at operating company and Group level.\n\nIn 2020, the main risks identified were unchanged from the previous year and relate to the use of third parties, operational and commercial decisions involving government agencies, and the inappropriate use of gifts and hospitality. No compliance breaches were identified in 2020.\n\nAnti-bribery and corruption training is mandatory for all IAG operating companies, Group functions and the Board and takes the form of e-learning supplemented by face-to-face sessions as necessary. Individual training requirements are set by each operating company and function, and are determined by factors such as the level and responsibilities of an employee. The Group-wide anti-bribery e-learning, which was rolled out in 2019, has a recurrence of three years. In 2020 a total of 1,984 employees completed the anti-bribery and corruption e-learning course, compared with 7,933 in 2019.\n\nTo identify, manage and mitigate potential bribery and corruption risks, IAG uses risk-based third-party due diligence which includes screenings, external reports, interviews and site visits depending on the level of risk that a third party presents. Any risks identified during the due diligence process are analysed and a mitigation plan put in place as necessary. Certain risks could result in termination of the proposed or existing relationship with the counterparty. The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee receives an annual update on the anti-bribery compliance programme.\n\nThere were no legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Group and its operating companies in 2020 and management is not aware of any impending cases or underlying issues.\n\nIAG has processes and procedures in place across the Group, such as supplier vetting and management, Know Your Counterparty procedures and financial policies and controls which help to combat money laundering in the business.",

        "page_content": "## A.5 Sustainability risks and opportunities\n\n## GRI 102-11, 102-15\n\n## Overview\n\nSince 2019, sustainable aviation risks have been identified as a principal risk to IAG. Climate-related risks are considered and assessed under the Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework which is presented to the Board. More details on risk management procedures, and how Group risks inter-relate, can be found in the 'Risk Management and principal risk factors' section.\n\nSustainability risks and opportunities, including climate-related risks and opportunities, are also identified and assessed by the Group Sustainability team, in conjunction with the Group ERM team. This assessment includes risks over medium-term (two to five years) and long-term (greater than five year) timescales. These risks are bi-annually reported to and reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee, and regularly reported to the IAG Chief of Staff who reports to the IAG CEO. Plans to mitigate risks are developed by relevant risk owners in specific areas of the business.\n\nIAG allocates significant resources to environmental risk management. This includes a strategic commitment to invest US$400 million (\u20ac360 million) over 20 years in SAF development, production and supply, along with a dedicated sustainable fuels team. This also includes a significant and continued investment over five years in the Honeywell GoDirect Flight Efficiency software, to manage risks related to operational efficiency, with dedicated representatives within operating companies to manage operational efficiency programmes. In addition, each of the Group's four main airlines are working towards IEnvA 1 accreditation and have invested in people and IT resources to enable this.\n\n1\n\nSee Sustainability Governance section for IEnvA definition.\n\nIAG is committed to mitigating the impacts of hazards which have uncertain but potentially highly negative outcomes, on the environment or people, if they occur. As such, IAG adopts precautionary measures to mitigate these hazards, an approach known as the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle is applied to the planning of operations and the development and launch of new services, by integrating climate considerations into business plans and financial forecasts and aligning activities with the Flightpath Net Zero programme. Detailed risk mitigation measures are outlined in the tables on the following pages.\n\n## TCFD-aligned climate-related scenario analysis\n\nIAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidance on climaterelated scenario analysis and climatespecific risk assessments. In 2018, IAG followed the TCFD six-step process and analysed the implications of climate change on business activity in 2030. This analysis helped in reviewing the resilience of IAG's business strategies in the context of climate change and was instrumental in the 2019 design and adoption of IAG's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy.\n\nThe 2018 exercise included two climate scenarios and the impacts of these scenarios on IAG's costs of inputs, operating costs, revenues, supply chain, and business interruption. Outputs included an initial qualitative assessment of how IAG could respond in terms of adapting the business model, portfolio mix, investments in transition capabilities and technologies and the potential impact on strategic and financial/uni00A0plans.\n\nThe scope of the exercise included:\n\n- \u00b7 a two-degree Celsius temperature rise scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6), consistent with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement;\n- \u00b7 a four-degree temperature rise scenario (RCP 8.5), as an alternative highemission scenario;\n- \u00b7 stakeholders from IAG Strategy, Treasury, ERM, Investor Relations, Digital Innovation, Procurement and Sustainability as well as environmental and fuel efficiency managers from our operating companies; and\n- \u00b7 2030 as a long-term timeframe but an intermediate milestone enroute to 2050.\n\nA key finding was that IAG would incur additional operating costs under both climate scenarios. Under a two-degree scenario, most of this increase would result from carbon prices or climate-related policy interventions. Under a four-degree scenario, IAG was more likely to face increased costs from operational disruption as a result of extreme weather events becoming more frequent.",

Specific risks are mitigated though existing processes, additional investments, or specific strategies as outlined in the table below. IAG uses internal carbon prices based on current EU ETS prices, the UK Department for Transport (DfT) Aviation Forecast, and International Energy Agency (IEA) CORSIA price forecasts. In 2020, EU ETS prices of \u20ac26/tonne and CORSIA prices of $17/tonne were used to forecast the compliance costs of international flights.\n\nmedium-term\n\n(2-5 years)\n\nlong-term (greater than 5 years)",

Climate change impacts\n\n## GRI 301-1, 302-1, 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5\n\nIAG's impact on climate change reduced dramatically in 2020, primarily reflecting the significant drop in flying activity. Scope 1 emissions dropped by 64 per cent, Scope 2 emissions dropped by 54 per cent and use of renewable energy rose by 11 percentage points. Emissions are expected to rise as the Group recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, growth is decoupling from emissions and internal forecasts suggest 2019 could represent peak emissions due to current and future use of a more fuel-efficient fleet and expanded use of SAF.\n\nIAG calculates its impact on climate change by multiplying fuel and energy use\n\n## Total GHG emissions in tonnes CO2e 1\n\n## Scope 3 GHG emissions in tonnes CO2e 1 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby appropriate conversion factors that are aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. UK Government GHG conversion factors are applied across the Group as these are deemed to be the most robust factors available. IEA national electricity emissions factors, and gCO2/ kWh factors from national agencies, are used to calculate Scope 2 emissions.\n\nIAG consumed a total of 43 million MWh of energy in 2020 with 86 per cent of electricity use and 0.6 per cent of total energy use being from renewable sources. 66 per cent of this consumption is attributed to the UK, based on British\n\n3,243,000\n\nAirways Scope 1 emissions and Group electricity use in UK-based offices.\n\nIAG discloses its impact in terms of CO2-equivalent emissions, which includes CO2, CH4, and N2O. Scope 1 emissions in 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 10.91 million tonnes (MT) carbon oxide/uni00A0(CO2)\n- \u00b7 0.10 MT nitrous oxide (N2O)\n- \u00b7 0.01 MT methane (CH4)\n\nThis shows that CO2 is 99 per cent of the Scope 1 impact. IAG only discloses CH4 and N2O as non-CO2 GHGs, in line with the latest available UK Government GHG conversion factors. 5% 158,000 1%\n\n7%\n\n235,000\n\n17%\n\n564,000\n\n70%\n\n2,286,000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFuel and energy-related activities\n\nCapital goods\n\nFranchises\n\nDownstream transport and distribution\n\nAll other Scope 3 categories\n\n| Key Metric                     | Unit       | vly    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 CO2e                   | MT CO2e    | -64%   | 11.02  | 30.78  | 29.99  | 28.76  | 28.26  |\n| Net Scope 1 CO2e               | MT CO2e    | -61%   | 10.85  | 27.60  | 27.22  | 26.17  | nr     |\n| Scope 2 location-based         | kt CO2e    | -23%   | 52.6   | 68.6   | 70.4   | 92.6   | 103.1  |\n| Scope 2 market-based           | kt CO2e    | -54%   | 10.0   | 21.7 3 | 40.7   | 61.9   | 92.9   |\n| Scope 3                        | MT CO2e    | -64%   | 3.24   | 9.04   | 8.79   | 7.88   | 7.64   |\n| Emissions intensity (jet fuel) | gCO2/pkm 4 | +18%   | 106.2  | 89.8   | 91.5   | 92.3   | 94.8   |\n| Renewable electricity          | %          | +11pts | 86%    | 75% 3  | 54%    | 54%    | nr     |\n\nNote: 'nr' means 'not reported previously'\n\n- 1 Values rounded to nearest thousand tonnes.\n- 2  Only material Scope 3 categories are reported here.

Climate change commitments - Flightpath Net Zero\n\n## Supports SDG 13\n\nIAG will deliver net zero emissions across its global operations by 2050. This aligns with worldwide efforts to keep average global average temperatures below a 1.5\u00b0C rise. IAG was the first airline group to commit to this goal and the first airline group to sign the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C pledge.\n\nIn this context, net zero emissions means that all CO2 that IAG operations emit in a year will be balanced out by an equivalent amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere. The net zero commitment covers Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions. IAG is committed to minimising non-CO2 impacts as well, and will review targets on these when the science around them becomes more robust. The focus is on reducing use of fossil jet fuel, as this accounts for 99 per cent of the Scope 1 and 2 footprint.\n\nThe pioneering Flightpath Net Zero programme underpins the IAG commitment. This programme includes 2025 and 2030 Group-wide targets, financial incentives for senior managers explicitly tied to delivery of carbon intensity targets for both the Group and operating airlines (See 'Sustainability strategy' section), and a published 30-year roadmap for achieving net zero.\n\nIAG will minimise gross emissions through a combination of fleet modernisation, operational efficiency and SAF. In 2050, any remaining emissions will be neutralised by use of GHG removal technology. IAG sees carbon offsets as a transitional measure and is advocating for government support for GHG removal technology via membership of the Coalition for Negative Emissions. Net emissions will be reduced in the short- and medium-term by use of carbon offset and removal projects and funding emissions reductions via the UK and EU ETS.\n\nGroup-wide climate targets remain the same and have been re-baselined to 2019 due to the pandemic:\n\n- \u00b7 Net zero CO2 emissions for British Airways UK domestic flights from January 1, 2020;\n- \u00b7 11 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency between 2019 and 2025, from 89.8g CO2/pkm to 80g CO2/pkm in 2025;\n- \u00b7 20 per cent reduction in net CO2 emissions between 2019 and 2030, from 27.6 MT to 22 MT in 2030; and\n- \u00b7 Net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG also had a target for a 10 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency between 2014 and 2020, from 97.5g CO2/pkm to 87.3g CO2/pkm. In 2019, IAG achieved 89.8gCO2/pkm and was on track. The 2020 target was not met due to a drop in passenger load factors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPlans for fleet composition and capacity and operational efficiency initiatives should enable delivery of the 2025 fuel efficiency target of 80g CO2/pkm. In light of the ongoing impact of COVID-19, IAG will review this target in the first half of 2021.\n\nIn 2020 IAG was an active participant in the SBTi Technical Working Group for aviation, to develop methodologies for aviation climate targets aligned with a global climate scenario of well below 2 degrees. Once the SBTi finalises a targetsetting methodology for airlines in 2021, IAG plans to submit a target for approval.",

Since 2013, operating airlines have been funding emissions reductions in other sectors to meet compliance obligations under the EU ETS, and since 2019 have been participating in the UN CORSIA scheme to enable carbon-neutral growth on eligible international flights.\n\nWhen IAG or operating companies choose to voluntarily invest in carbon avoidance\n\nand removal projects, they work in collaboration with key partners, carry out due diligence to select reputable providers, and select projects carefully to meet and align with verified quality standards.\n\n## 2020 progress:\n\n- \u00b7 IAG supported the change of CORSIA baseline to 2019 from 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 Aer Lingus launched its carbon offsetting programme for passengers.

Waste\n\n## GRI 306-1 (2020), 306-2 (2020), 306-3 (2020) Supports SDG 12\n\nIAG has made great progress with waste tracking and waste initiatives over the past few years. For example, Iberia waste per passenger dropped 12 per cent from 2016 to 2019. Initiatives across the Group include reducing and recycling plastic, glass, metal cans, paper and food waste.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has set back progress by making it harder to calculate a waste baseline, pausing or delaying some waste initiatives, and driving temporary re-introductions of plastic items for health and safety reasons. For example, progress on the 2020 British Airways target to remove 700 tonnes of onboard single-use plastic (SUP) was unable to be tracked as result of changes to flying volumes, onboard catering and internal resources.\n\nHowever, in 2021 IAG plans to set new Group-wide waste reduction targets, update the Group Sustainability policy to place greater emphasis on waste, and comply with the EU SUP ban when it enters into force in July.\n\nOnboard services are IAG's main source of waste. Key inputs include onboard meals and newspapers supplied to passengers, and key outputs include plastic packaging, leftover food waste, drinks cans, and cabin items such as wrappers. Waste is typically offloaded and processed at airports by third-party caterers, with some materials recovered on-site and other materials incinerated or sent to landfill. The majority of cabin and catering waste is processed at IAG's hub airports - London Heathrow, Dublin, Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nWhere possible, IAG acts to reduce food waste while maintaining customer choice. For example, British Airways runs a pre-flight top-up catering service for London flights, to meet late changes to onboard catering requirements whilst minimising over-catering which would increase food waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- portable solar lights to 40 rural health clinics in Zambia and Malawi; and\n- \u00b7 Vueling sponsored the not-for-profit GreenNova and their CAPTACO2 research project to capture CO2 from the air.\n\nSince January 2020 British Airways has offset the carbon emissions on all flights within the UK. Equivalent emissions reductions have been achieved through British Airways' voluntary investment in a range of quality, Gold Standard- and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)-verified carbon reduction projects.

Workforce overview\n\n## GRI 403-4, 408-1, 409-1 Supports SDG 12\n\nIAG aims to create an environment in which employees feel motivated, safe and able to thrive as this is central to the continued success of the Group. Core principles in the Code of Conduct include fair and equal treatment, nondiscrimination, fairness and respect for human rights. This Code applies to all Directors, managers and employees of the Group and e-learning training to support it is mandatory and applicable to all employees and Directors. Individual operating companies have responsibility for policies and procedures relating to their employees, including appropriate reward frameworks to ensure they can continue to attract and retain the best talent for every role.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 57,928 people were employed across the Group in 82 countries, a decrease of 20 per cent in the year. Our voluntary turnover rate for 2020 was 15 per cent compared with 7 per cent in 2019, a change that reflects the unfortunate but necessary resizing of the business.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways has worked closely with its trades unions to reach agreements to save jobs and reduce costs. In some areas this has reduced the need for redundancies by a significant number or even altogether. This has been coupled with voluntary measures such as unpaid leave and part-time working to reduce the size of the workforce as the demand for flying remained significantly reduced. Where redundancies have been necessary, a large proportion of these have been achieved through voluntary measures.\n\nFor those employees who were made redundant, support has been offered to help them find alternative employment and explore redeployment opportunities. In British Airways, for instance, retention pools have been created to support redundant employees back into the workplace, should the situation improve.\n\nMeasures to support employee satisfaction and talent management are primarily managed within operating companies. Each operating company has its own established methods of measuring employee satisfaction. IAG is currently working to align the talent management framework across the Group, focusing at Group level on the IAG Management Committee and their direct reports. IAG has a good track record of retaining and promoting talent into senior roles, as evidenced by the Management Committee appointments during 2020.\n\nIAG has employees based in European countries which comply with the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), covering subjects that are considered as fundamental principles and rights at work: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Outside of the EU, IAG recognises trade unions in many jurisdictions, has collective agreements and meets/exceeds all relevant labour standards.\n\nIAG has a European Works Council (EWC) which brings together employee representatives from the different European Economic Area (EEA) Member States in which the Group operates. EWC representatives are informed about and, where appropriate, consulted on transnational matters which may impact employees in two or more EEA Member States. During 2020, IAG hosted one full meeting of the EWC (compared with two in 2019) and eight Select Committee meetings, which have all been held virtually since March.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWithin the Group, individual operating companies have responsibility for the policies and procedures relating to their employees, including reward frameworks to ensure they can continue to attract and retain the best talent for every role.\n\nDue to the diverse nature of Group businesses, both in terms of jurisdictions and operations, all training policies and programmes are implemented at operating company level. Each is responsible for determining the specific courses offered within their organisation, the frequency with which training courses must be completed, and the employees required to attend. However, across the Group, all operating companies are required to run the following mandatory corporate training courses for their employees:\n\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Compliance with Competition Laws\n- \u00b7 Anti-bribery and Corruption Compliance\n- \u00b7 Data Privacy, Security and Protection.",

        "page_content": "## Managing risk in an extremely challenging and uncertain environment\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that IAG has an appropriate risk management framework, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives. The Board has oversight of the Group's operations to ensure that internal controls are in place and operate effectively. Management is responsible for the effective operation of the internal controls and execution of the agreed/uni00A0risk mitigation plans.\n\nThe Group has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) policy which has been approved by the Board. This policy sets the framework for a comprehensive risk management process and methodology, ensuring a robust identification and assessment of the risks facing the Group, including emerging risks. Enterprise risks are assessed and plotted on an Enterprise risk map (with individual risk maps produced for each operating company and relevant function, such as IAG Tech and IAG Group Business Services, and for the overall Group). This/uni00A0process is led by the Management Committee and best practices are shared across the Group.\n\nThis year, in response to the pandemic crisis, the risk management framework has further evolved to: develop the Group's assessment of the interdependencies of risks; built on scenario planning to quantify risk impact under different assumptions; and consider the risks within the Group's risk map that have increased either as a result of the external environment or as a result of decisions made by the business in response to the external environment. The process adopted this year has helped the Board and management to respond quickly to the new and rapidly changing risk landscape, enabling clear understanding and identification of emerging risks arising from the impact of the pandemic and of how the pandemic has affected existing risks included within the Group's existing risk maps.\n\n## Approach and process\n\nAcross the Group, risk owners are responsible for identifying potential risks and appropriately managing the related business decisions within their area of responsibility. As the Group transforms, the level of change and agility required creates risks and opportunities. For these business transformational risks, business\n\nowners are assigned, and the business will agree appropriate mitigations and timelines for implementation, following discussions with all relevant stakeholders. All risks are assessed for likelihood and impact against the Group's three-year Business Plan and strategy. Key controls and mitigations are documented including appropriate response plans. Where risk treatments require time to implement, short-term mitigations are assessed and the timeline to risk mitigation and consequent risk acceptance discussed and agreed. Every principal risk has clear Management Committee oversight.\n\nAs part of the risk management framework, potential emerging risks and/uni00A0longer-term threats are considered to/uni00A0identify new trends, competitor actions, regulations, governments' interventions, or business disruptors that could impact the Group's/uni00A0business strategy and plans. These emerging risks are monitored within the overall risk framework as 'on watch' until they are re-assessed to/uni00A0be no longer a potential threat to the business or where an assessment of the risk impact over the next two to three years can be made, and appropriate mitigations can be/uni00A0put in place. Following the pandemic impact, consideration of other high-impact, low likelihood risks have been discussed.\n\nIAG considers risks to the Strategic Business Plan over the short term up to/uni00A0two years, medium term from three to five/uni00A0years and in the longer term beyond five years. Risk outcomes are quantified as the potential cash impact to the business plan over two years, as well as potential brand reputation, regulatory scrutiny and share price considerations.\n\nThe risk management framework is embedded across the Group. Risk maps are discussed, and risk potential impacts assessed for each operating company and Group functions that support the business, such as IAG Tech and IAG GBS, and at the Group level, and the enterprise risk function ensures consistency over the risk management process.\n\nRisk maps are reviewed by each operating company's management committee, which considers the accuracy and completeness of the map, significant movements in risk and any changes required to the response plans addressing those risks. Where the Group's operating companies have a reliance on other parts\n\nof the Group for services delivery, risks are reflected appropriately across risk maps to ensure accountability is clear. Each operating company's management committee confirms to its operating company board as to the identification, quantification and management of risks/uni00A0within its operating company as a/uni00A0whole at least annually.\n\nThe management committee of each operating company escalates risks that/uni00A0have a Group impact or require Group/uni00A0consideration in line with the Group/uni00A0ERM framework.\n\nAt the Group level, key risks from the operating companies, together with Group-wide risks, are maintained in a Group risk map. The IAG Management Committee reviews risk during the year including the Group risk map semiannually in advance of reviews by the Audit and Compliance Committee in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate/uni00A0Governance Code and the/uni00A0Spanish Good Governance Code for/uni00A0Listed Companies.\n\nThe IAG Board of Directors discusses risk and considers the risk environment as part of wider Board discussions at every meeting in addition to the bi-annual risk map review, including a review of the assessment of IAG's performance against its risk appetite, scenarios for assessment of viability and the outputs from the viability modelling. The Board has ongoing early sight of management consideration of potential scenarios to enable it to challenge subjectivities and confirm rationale.\n\nIAG has a risk appetite framework which includes statements informing the business, either qualitatively or quantitatively, of the Board's appetite for certain risks. Each risk appetite statement formalises how performance is monitored either on a Group-wide basis or within major projects. The framework remained in place throughout the year, with the Board assessing its appetite to tolerance of certain risks through additional reviews with management. The highly regulated and commercially competitive environment, together with the businesses' operational complexity, exposes the Group to a number of risks. 2020 has heightened IAG's exposure to certain of these risks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic's unprecedented impact on the travel and aviation industry.

The operations of the Group's suppliers, including aircraft manufacturers, have also been impacted by the pandemic, which has increased the risk of significant business interruption, delays or disruptions, such as a temporary suspension of operations, a lack of availability of labour to support supplier operations and/or longer-term problems in maintaining supply, whether as a result of suppliers entering insolvency or otherwise. This may lead to shortages of business-critical services and/or increased costs to secure such services.\n\nThe Group continues to lobby and raise awareness of the negative impacts of ATC airspace restrictions and performance issues on the aviation sector and economies across/uni00A0Europe, particularly through a future recovery period.\n\nThe Group relies on the provision of airport infrastructure and is dependent on the timely delivery of appropriate facilities. A third runway expansion proposal at London Heathrow and additional facilities at Dublin Airport are among examples where the Group supports solutions that are efficient, cost effective and of value to our customers.\n\n| Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Strategic relevance                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Mitigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IAG is dependent on the timely  entry/uni00A0of/uni00A0new/uni00A0aircraft and the engine  performance of/uni00A0aircraft to/uni00A0improve operational  efficiency/uni00A0and/uni00A0resilience and support  the/uni00A0delivery/uni00A0of the Group sustainability  programme.                                                                                                                            | Any sub-optimal service delivery or asset  supplied by a critical supplier can impact  on/uni00A0the Group airlines' operational and  financial performance as well as  disrupting our customers.

Brand reputation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus The Group's ability to attract and secure bookings, and therefore revenue depends on the public recognition of the Group's airlines' brands and their associated reputation. The Group's airlines brands are, and will continue to be, vulnerable to adverse market or customer perception. Reliability, including on-time performance, is a key element of the brands and of each customer's experience. IAG remains focused on strengthening its customercentricity to ensure that its operating companies continue to adapt and focus their business models to meet changing customer expectations. The Group's airlines have implemented strict hygiene and social distancing measures to ensure customer and employee safety in line with EASA regulations.

Competition, consolidation and government regulation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus The scale of governmental support and aviation-specific state aid measures have varied by market and the potential consequential impact to the competitive landscape is under continuous assessment. Governmental restrictions, introduced to address the pandemic risk, have been fragmented and volatile and have required significant agility within our networks to manage the impact on our customers and business. The Group announced plans in 2019 to acquire Air Europa, which is owned by Globalia, subject to regulatory approvals. In November 2020, the Group reached an amended agreement with Globalia, which is still subject to the satisfactory negotiation with Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones (SEPI) regarding the non-financial terms associated with the financial support provided by SEPI to Air Europa in 2020.

This has strengthened IAG Tech's focus on understanding business requirements, helping to transform the Group's businesses and deliver a digital customer experience, which together with the Group's exploitation of technology, reduces the impact digital disruptors can have.\n\n| Risk description                                                                                                 | Strategic relevance                                                                                                                            | Mitigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Technology disruptors may use/uni00A0tools to  position themselves between our brands  and our/uni00A0customers. | Competitors and new entrants to/uni00A0the  travel market may use/uni00A0technology more  effectively and disrupt the Group's  business model. | \u00b7  IAG Tech is responsible for digital and IT. \u00b7  Operating companies' CDIOs are members of the IAG Tech  management committee.                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                | \u00b7  The Group's CIO and Chief Transformation Officer are  members of the IAG Management Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                | \u00b7  IAG Customer Steering Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                | \u00b7  The Group continues to develop platforms such as/uni00A0the/uni00A0New  Distribution Capability, changing distribution arrangements  and moving from indirect/uni00A0to direct channels. \u00b7  IAG Tech continues to create early engagement/uni00A0and  leverages new opportunities with start-ups and technology |\n\n## 5. Sustainable aviation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus IAG was the first airline group to commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, including adding management targets in current incentive arrangements. Sustainable Aviation, one world and Airlines for Europe have also all now committed to net zero emissions by 2050. There is an emerging trend of introduction of aviation 'eco taxes' globally. The Group has accelerated the retirement of its aged fleet of Boeing 747s and Airbus A340s during 2020, in response to the pandemic. The Group also maintained its plans and initiatives to meet climate change commitments.\n\nIAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines for climate-related scenario analysis and climate-specific risk assessments. During 2020 the Group has updated its assessment of climate-related risks, by testing and revising the assumptions on updated forecasts for future business growth and the regulatory context and future carbon price. The Group has also embedded forecasting of its climate impacts into its strategic, business and financial planning processes.\n\nWhile 2020 was a year of unprecedented disruption and uncertainty due the pandemic, other key aspects of aviation policy continued to be developed in relation to sustainability. In July the European Commission published a roadmap for its legislative initiative aimed at implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), alongside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Sustainability risk and opportunities section\n\n| Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                     | Strategic relevance                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mitigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Increasing global concern about climate  change and the impact of carbon affects  Group airlines' performance as  customers seek alternative methods of  transport or reduce their levels of travel. | IAG is committed to being the/uni00A0leading  airline group in/uni00A0sustainability.

Cyber attack and data security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus The risks from cyber threats has been heightened in the year as many of the Group's employees and suppliers' employees moved to workingfrom-home arrangements in line with governments' advice and restrictions, requiring analyses of security arrangements and authentications over access to corporate environments. More widely, the external environment saw an increase in the frequency of phishing attacks as cyber criminals attempted to take advantage of remote working practices.\n\nThe regulatory regimes associated with data and infrastructure security are also becoming more complex with different regulators applying different framework approaches and guidance for reporting. The Group airlines are subject to the requirements of privacy legislation such as GDPR and the National Information Security Directive (NISD).\n\nIn relation to the theft of customer data in 2018 the UK Information Commissioner's Office issued a final penalty notice to British Airways.\n\nDespite significant reductions in the Group's capital expenditure, in response to the liquidity impact of the pandemic, investment in cyber security systems remained at levels originally planned.\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nThe Group could face financial loss, disruption or damage to brand reputation/uni00A0arising from an attack on the Group's systems by criminals, foreign governments or hacktivists.\n\nIf the Group does not adequately protect customer and employee data, it could breach regulation and face penalties and loss of customer/uni00A0trust.\n\nChanges in working practices and environments for the Group's employees and third-party suppliers could result in new weaknesses in the cyber and data security control environment.\n\nThe cyber threat environment remains challenging for all organisations, including the airline industry. Cyber threat actors, criminals, foreign governments and hacktivists have the capacity and motivation to attack the airline industry for financial gain and other political or social reasons.\n\nThe fast-moving nature of/uni00A0this/uni00A0risk means that the Group/uni00A0will always retain a level of vulnerability.\n\n## 7.

Political and economic environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus The pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing, at very short notice, numerous, differing and wide-ranging measures in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, curfews, quarantines, lockdowns and restrictions on non-essential services. This has led to an unprecedented decrease in the demand for both domestic and international air travel and has also resulted in severe economic downturns and rising unemployment levels in a number of countries and regions. These are being actively monitored and near-term capacity plans are refreshed dynamically, according to the latest status.\n\nThere can also be no certainty as to the level of demand for the Group's services after any restrictions are lifted; the Group anticipates that global passenger demand will not return to 2019 levels until at least 2023.\n\nWider macroeconomic trends are being monitored such as tensions between the US and China, particularly over the terms of the trade deal and how the new administration in the US plans to engage with the Chinese government. The imposition of tariffs by the EU on the US in response to the findings of a WTO review could also result in an escalation of application of tariffs elsewhere. The stress of the pandemic could have further farreaching impacts including currency devaluations, new tax regimes on corporates and individuals as well as changes in control of governments and new government policies.\n\nFollowing the referendum decision in 2016, the UK left the EU on December 31, 2020 under the terms of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business is also set out in the Chief Executive Officer's review and the Financial review.\n\nAs part of the review of the business model and assessment of Group strategy alignment to the external environment, the Directors have assessed key threats and trends faced by the industry, emerging risks and opportunities arising from the pandemic as well as other structural industry risks and non sector-specific risks over a timeframe beyond the plan period, for example climate change risk. These are considered in the light of how they could impact our business model and relevance, our operations or our customers and include changes in regulations, customer trends and behaviours, macroeconomic predictions on growth, regional market opportunities and technology trends and infrastructure developments that could impact our operations, as well as more existential threats to the aviation industry.\n\nWhen developing the Group's three year Business Plan ('Business Plan'), longer-term considerations have been assessed by the Management Committee in conjunction with the priorities faced by the business during the next three years in responding to the impact of the pandemic crisis on the Group's businesses. The Board has also conducted its annual strategy session in addition to increased review meetings during the year, where these longer-term considerations have been assessed in parallel with the near-term priorities and adaptions required by the Group. Following this process, short-, medium- and longer-term plans, challenges and opportunities have been identified and actions agreed.\n\nThe Group has undertaken extensive analysis, forecasting and scenario modelling over the last 12 months. It has refined the models and developed the depth of the analysis to ensure that the stresses considered reflected specifics to markets and regions across Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia and Vueling as well as the analysis completed at the Group level. Assumptions have been refined based on the impact of the pandemic on the airlines and other businesses through 2020 and into 2021. The modelling was refreshed in February 2021 for the latest available information and predictions. This refresh of the Business Plan formed the Base Case ('Base Case') for the purposes of the Viability (and Going Concern) assessment.\n\nDuring 2020 and in January and February 2021, the Board reviewed, on many occasions, scenarios stressing the financial plans for both the second half of 2020 and for the period to December 2023. These exercises leveraged the existing processes and models used for viability assessment within the Group. When considering the viability of the Group, for the purposes of this report, the Directors have evaluated the risk landscape facing the Group and recommended plausible but severe downside scenarios that could impact the Group's refreshed three-year Business Plan (the 'Base Case') to determine the Group's resilience to such impacts. The results of these severe but plausible downside scenarios (as described below) on the Base Case have been presented both pre and post an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available over this period (and not already reflected in the Base Case).\n\nThe scenarios have been defined by management and designed to consider principal risks that could materialise over the viability period and weaken the Group's liquidity position. Each scenario considered the impact on liquidity, solvency and the ability to raise financing in an uncertain and volatile environment. When considering the mitigations, management has assessed mitigations that are available to the business beyond operating cost reductions including further financing, capital expenditure plans and potential disposals. Options that may not have been previously considered as mitigations were presented with recommendations for the Board to review. In assessing the potential mitigations, the Board considered, amongst other matters, the expected speed of implementation in response to the uncertainty and the future flexibility required for the Group to adapt further as needed.\n\nSensitivities in the scenarios' assumptions have been highlighted by management and challenged by the Board. In addition, the Board reviewed the results of reverse stress testing, which demonstrated the level of revenue decline (before mitigations) that would result in the Group using all available cash balances and compared this to the outputs from the scenarios analyses.\n\nManagement has assessed and the Board considered the longer-term sustainability and climate-related risks, applying scenario analysis techniques as set out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) process, and their potential impact on the Group's viability over the next three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details of the Group's sustainability risks and opportunities, see Sustainability section.",

Although the prospects of the Group are considered over/uni00A0a longer period, the Directors have determined that a three-year period is an appropriate time frame for assessment as it/uni00A0is aligned with the Group's strategic planning period (as reflected in the Base Case) and the external uncertainties facing the aviation sector more widely are significantly beyond any experience to date/uni00A0and regularly unexpectedly change. The/uni00A0Board recognises the pace of change required within the Group to further adapt and respond to this environment in addition to the rapidly changing competitive landscape and wider global macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe Group has modelled the impact of mitigating actions to offset further deterioration in demand and capacity, including reductions in operating\n\nexpenditure and capital expenditure. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.\n\nFurther details on debt financing can be found in the Going Concern disclosures in note 2 of the Group financial statements.\n\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation, meet its liabilities as they fall due and raise financing as required over the period to December 2023. However, this is subject to/uni00A0a number of significant factors related to/uni00A0the pandemic that are outside of the control of the Group. In reaching this assessment the Directors have made the following assumptions when considering both the Base Case and the Downside Case:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group will continue to have access to/uni00A0funding options and that the capital markets retain a level of stability and appetite for funding within the aviation sector;\n- \u00b7 the Group can implement any further structural changes required in agreement with any union consultation processes and/uni00A0regulatory approvals;\n- \u00b7 the pandemic does not result in further prolonged and substantial capacity reductions and groundings into H2 2022 or beyond; and\n- \u00b7 any new virus strain or threat to public health that emerges during the viability period can be/uni00A0managed within vaccination and testing regimes and do not result in new government regulations that further significantly affect our/uni00A0airlines' operations.\n\nDue to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and potential for future waves of the pandemic and the impact on travel restrictions and/or demand, the Group is not able to provide certainty that there could not be more severe downside scenarios than those it has considered, including the stresses it has considered in relation to factors such as the impact on yield, capacity operated, cost mitigations achieved and fuel price variations. In the event that such a/uni00A0scenario were to occur, the Group would need to implement additional mitigation measures and would likely need to secure additional funding over and above that which is contractually committed at February 25, 2021. The Group has been successful in raising financing since the outbreak of COVID-19, however the Group cannot provide certainty that it will be able to/uni00A0secure additional funding, if required, in the event that a more severe downside scenario than those it has considered were to occur.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory environment\n\n## Overview\n\nRegulatory matters assumed more than their usual level of prominence and scrutiny in 2020 with two topics dominating the policy agenda: the introduction of regulations around the world to restrict international air travel in response to the spread of COVID-19 and the continuing Brexit negotiations as the transition period/uni00A0for the UK's departure from the European Union (EU) came to a close at the end of December.\n\nThroughout the year, IAG's airlines contributed directly to the development of rules in respect of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted aviation and travel in order to maintain operations to the greatest extent possible while ensuring customer and staff safety. The Group also provided input during 2020 to the Brexit discussions in support of a positive negotiated settlement to benefit UK and European citizens.\n\nIAG also worked with regulators and authorities around the world on key policy areas such as sustainability in order to try and secure the best long-term outcomes for its customers.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, states around the world began to close their borders to different degrees, leading to a dramatic impact on worldwide traffic volumes.\n\nIAG aimed throughout 2020 to work constructively with regulators and contributed to their deliberations wherever possible on how to respond to the virus to allow safe, continued operations and to demonstrate the inherent safety of air services themselves.\n\nIn Ireland, Spain and the UK, IAG's airlines worked with national regulators as they developed their policies to ensure these were practically deliverable and balanced so as to allow air transport to continue safely and that guidance to industry and restrictions on travel were, where possible, measured and workable. British Airways made a significant contribution to the development of the ICAO's Council Aviation Recovery Task Force (CART) process, running trial protocols and becoming the first airline worldwide to be assessed against its criteria. Similarly, working directly, and with industry association Airlines for Europe (A4E), IAG experts helped the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) develop guidelines on aviation health safety\n\nprotocols. However, where IAG believed measures were severely detrimental to its own and its customers' interests, and provided no health benefit, the Group also acted. This included working with other airlines in the UK to bring a Judicial Review challenge to the UK Government's imposition of blanket quarantine measures. These measures were ultimately amended to satisfy the Group's objections at the time.\n\nAs the crisis endured, IAG worked with partner and competitor airlines as well as with academic partners to provide data on the efficacy of different approaches to COVID-19 testing. The Group also operated programmes to trial different approaches for testing in support of enabling states to safely remove quarantine policies that restrict travel. IAG staff continue to take every opportunity to work with national regulators and policy makers as the spread of the virus and the deployment of vaccines influences changes to regulatory requirements. In particular IAG continues to promote the need for a digital solution to the sharing and verification of personal data, health certificates and other requirements for travel. This includes working with individual developers, for example the VeriFly app successfully trialled by British Airways and contributing to potential industry-wide solutions such as those being promoted by IATA.\n\n## Brexit\n\nThe UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 remaining bound by the EU's laws and benefiting as if it were a member state in a transition period running until December 31, 2020.\n\nDuring 2020 there was therefore no change to air services between the EU and the UK. Throughout the year IAG engaged with regulators and policy makers in the UK, Brussels and a number of EU Member States to ensure that the needs of IAG's customers after Brexit are understood and, in particular, that policymakers recognise the economic and social importance of uninterrupted air services between the EU and the UK.\n\nAfter protracted negotiations the UK and the EU agreed an overall trade deal that includes air transport. This agreement ensures that all IAG airlines' flights could continue as they did before Brexit. The only change is a very minor limitation on codeshare arrangements.\n\nDuring 2020, the UK Government also finalised agreements with all other countries with which it needed to replace existing EU-wide arrangements for air services, including formally signing on November 17, 2020 the agreement reached in 2018 with the US.\n\nIAG implemented plans to ensure that its EU-licensed airlines continue to comply with EU ownership and control rules following Brexit. These remedial plans were approved by national regulators in Spain and Ireland. The plans include the implementation of a national ownership structure for Aer Lingus and changes to the Group's longstanding national ownership structure in Spain.\n\nIt is notable that the Brexit agreement recognises the potential benefits of the continued liberalisation of ownership and control of air carriers and commits the EU and UK to examining options in that area during 2021. The Group will continue to encourage regulators around the world to normalise ownership of airlines in line with other business sectors.\n\n## Other policy areas\n\nWhile 2020 was a year of unprecedented disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, other key aspects of aviation policy continued to be developed in particular in relation to sustainability. In July the European Commission published a roadmap for its legislative initiative aimed at implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).\n\nWith its strong credentials in this field, IAG provided key input to the joint product of the European aviation industry, initiated by A4E, 'Destination 2050, aviation's roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050.' Published in December, this roadmap shows how European aviation can reduce emissions through new aircraft and engine technology, operational efficiency, sustainable aviation fuels, economic measures (such as CORSIA) and greenhouse gas removal technology.\n\nIAG continued to highlight the need for reform of the European air traffic management system and airport charges legislation to make the industry fit for a new future. The Group continues to demonstrate the economic and social value of aviation, through trade, tourism and bringing families together as tools to support economic recovery from the pandemic.",

'\n\nThis is my first report as the Chairman of/uni00A0IAG and I want to begin by thanking Antonio V\u00e1zquez, our outgoing Chairman, for the magnificent job he has done since the Group was created in 2011 to create such solid foundations for our corporate governance structure. I am also indebted to him for the tremendous support he has given me during the transition process.\n\nIt's a great honour to lead the IAG Board and to have the trust of my fellow directors in carrying out this role.\n\nI come into the post at the end of an unprecedented year for the Group, faced/uni00A0with the incredible disruption to our business caused by COVID-19 but also in/uni00A0the midst of the most fundamental changes in our executive and Board leadership in ten years, including the appointment of five new Board members.\n\nDespite these extraordinary times, the Board's role remains the same - to create long-term sustainable value for shareholders and our wider stakeholders.\n\nIn a crisis, however, the guidance we provide to the management team is more important than ever and our focus on the long term and on the interests of different stakeholders is right at the forefront of our thinking. This year, we were particularly focused first and foremost on confronting this crisis, overseeing the different initiatives for cash preservation and securing liquidity, as well as considering allocation of capital and risk management\n\nmatters, while issues around the acquisition of Air Europa and Brexit were also high on our agenda.\n\nI am very proud of the work and commitment shown by the Board in our response to the pandemic. We held a total of 42 Board meetings during the year as well as carrying out extra work to/uni00A0challenge, support and advise the/uni00A0management team. It's in times like these when a Board really proves its worth and I think that the Board rose to the occasion on contribution, availability and/uni00A0commitment.\n\nAs I've said the interests of stakeholders have been to the fore. But I would highlight one group in particular - the great people who work for our Group. Their wellbeing and ability to adapt to new ways of working have been central to/uni00A0our/uni00A0thinking, particularly when difficult decisions have had to be taken and sacrifices made. Efforts by our airlines to/uni00A0make sure customers remain safe at/uni00A0every point of travel during this overwhelming health emergency were also a big focus for the Board.\n\n## Board and committee changes\n\nEffective succession planning is a vital element of good corporate governance. We faced some huge challenges here, which tested the resilience of our governance framework.\n\nFor any company, no change in leadership is greater than the appointment of a new chief executive. We were glad, at the start of the year, to announce the appointment of an internal candidate, Luis Gallego, to/uni00A0succeed Willie Walsh in the role. Luis' knowledge of the Group and of our industry is proving extremely valuable in/uni00A0these trying circumstances. I would like to thank Willie for his fundamental contribution to IAG and for his commitment from the inception of the Group right through to his last day with us, and particularly for agreeing to stay on for an extra six months in 2020.\n\nKieran Poynter, an IAG non-executive director since 2011, stepped down from the/uni00A0Board at our shareholders' meeting in/uni00A0September, having been an outstanding chair of the Audit Committee. We thank him for his great contribution to the Group from its inception. We also said farewell to/uni00A0Marc Bolland, who decided not to seek",

        "page_content": "re-election, and he goes with our great gratitude also.\n\nTo fill these vacancies, Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips were elected to the Board, having been proposed by our largest shareholder, Qatar Airways. Both/uni00A0are valuable recruits to our team - Giles with a background in aviation, and Robin with his long experience in the financial sector.\n\nAs Antonio mentioned in his opening letter to this report, we had to make other significant changes in relation to Brexit to/uni00A0meet the requirement of having a majority of independent, EU non-executive directors. Deborah Kerr, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda and Steve Gunning stepped down in/uni00A0December 2020 to help us fulfil this requirement and we thank them for their flexibility and their contribution. Steve's executive duties as Chief Financial Officer remain unchanged and he will continue to/uni00A0attend Board meetings.\n\nWe appointed Peggy Bruzelius, Eva Castillo and Heather Ann McSharry to fill these positions and are grateful for the perspective and experience they bring -/uni00A0Peggy, with a background in financial services and project finance; Eva, with deep knowledge of telecoms and finance; and Heather Ann, with a career spent in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, financial services and consumer products. They are all well versed in governance having all served as non-executives before.\n\nIt's particularly pleasing to note that with their appointment female representation on the Board now stands at 45 per cent, with women also chairing two of our Committees. We remain committed to/uni00A0improving ethnic diversity in line with current best practice.\n\nWe have also refreshed the membership of/uni00A0the Board's Committees, including appointing new chairs in each case.\n\nYou can find further details of all these changes and appointments in the Nominations Committee report.\n\n## Management changes\n\nIn addition to approving the appointment of a new Chief Executive, the Board also considered the appointments of Javier S\u00e1nchez-Prieto, replacing Luis as Executive Chairman and CEO of Iberia, and Marco Sansavini moving over to lead Vueling. These appointments were delayed, along with Luis' elevation, until September to\n\nmake sure we had stability in the early days of/uni00A0the pandemic.\n\nThe Nominations Committee also approved the following further significant changes in our leadership team:\n\n- \u00b7 Sean Doyle, as the new British Airways Chief Executive;\n- \u00b7 Donal Moriarty as acting interim Chief Executive of Aer Lingus;\n- \u00b7 Fernando Candela in a new Management Committee role of Chief Transformation Officer; and\n- \u00b7 David Podolsky as the new IAG Chief Strategy Officer.\n\nAll these appointments with the exception of David, who was previously at Bain & Co, were internal - yet again proving the superb pipeline of talent we have within the Company.\n\n## Board evaluation and inductions\n\nWe carried out an internal evaluation of/uni00A0the Board during the year. Although it/uni00A0was a limited exercise because of the amount of change in the Board and committees composition, it came to some useful conclusions, allowing us to draw on/uni00A0the experience of former directors and committee members. The process was overseen by the Nominations Committee and led by Antonio and me, with the support of the Board Secretariat. You can/uni00A0read more about it further on in this/uni00A0report.\n\nWe are making a special effort to/uni00A0introduce our new colleagues to the/uni00A0business as quickly and efficiently as/uni00A0possible. Obviously the induction programme has had to be adjusted to/uni00A0contend with the current environment, ensuring it brings new directors up to speed on current matters being debated by the Board and its committees. Details of/uni00A0the induction process are provided further on in this report.\n\n## Culture, employee and stakeholder engagement\n\nLast year, given the challenging environment and the travel restrictions, work on culture and employee engagement was led by the operating companies. The IAG Board was regularly and closely informed of these initiatives. Particular focus was given to the wellbeing, health and safety of our employees.\n\nIn addition, in the last quarter a major and deep study was undertaken using common methodology with the help of McKinsey to/uni00A0evaluate culture for each business unit. This comprehensive study constitutes an excellent base to identify opportunities and establish action plans to continue to/uni00A0make sustainable progress in this critical/uni00A0area.\n\nRestructuring plans were also shared with the Board, and the Board could confirm the rigour with which the different companies approached these difficult processes. We are extremely proud of the commitment, resilience and flexibility shown by people right across the Group during these very challenging times.\n\nFinally, as a result of a review of our governance architecture, the Board has/uni00A0decided to retain direct oversight of/uni00A0culture and governance matters, giving it a/uni00A0greater priority by involving all Board members in this task. In addition, the remit of the Safety Committee was expanded to/uni00A0include environment and corporate responsibility, with a new composition fully meeting governance requirements. It will help improve the Board's oversight and involvement on sustainability and all related matters, sharpening our focus in/uni00A0this crucial area.\n\n## Outlook\n\nI cannot say how proud I am of how people at every level of the Group have/uni00A0performed in these most difficult of times. Our employees, our various leadership teams and the Board itself, have all shown remarkable strength, endurance and adaptability.\n\nThat gives me great confidence that we/uni00A0will emerge from this crisis - not only stronger, but also ready to transform IAG/uni00A0into a more sustainable business for the future.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman",

In accordance with Spanish legal requirements, this Corporate Governance report includes information regarding compliance with the Spanish Good Governance Code of Listed Companies (which was updated and published in June 2020), as well as other information related to IAG's corporate governance./uni00A0This report is part of the IAG Management Report.\n\nAt/uni00A0the same time, as IAG has a listing on/uni00A0the/uni00A0London Stock Exchange, it is/uni00A0also/uni00A0subject to the UK Listing Rules, including the requirement to explain whether it complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the UK Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') as amended from time to time. A copy of the current version of the UK/uni00A0Corporate Governance Code applicable to this reporting period (updated and published in July 2018) is/uni00A0available/uni00A0at the website of the FRC (www.frc.org.uk).\n\nIAG has prepared a consolidated Corporate Governance Report responding to both Spanish and UK reporting requirements. This Corporate Governance Report is available on/uni00A0the/uni00A0Company's website (www.iairgroup.com), and it is also available on the Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) website (www.cnmv.es). Pursuant to the CNMV regulations, this report has been filed with the CNMV accompanied by a statistical annex covering some legally required/uni00A0data.\n\nIn addition, and as required by the LSE Listing Rules, this Corporate Governance Report includes an explanation regarding the/uni00A0Company's application of the/uni00A0principles of the UK/uni00A0Corporate Governance Code. In effect, the disclosures in this Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report, including the different Board committees' reports, have been grouped into each of the five areas in which the Code is divided with the objective of helping shareholders and investors to assess how IAG has applied the Code principles during the reporting period.\n\nDuring 2020, IAG fully complied with almost all the applicable recommendations of the Spanish Corporate Governance Code with the following exceptions, in relation to which the Company is reporting partial compliance:\n\n- \u00b7 Recommendation number 1 regarding the existence of share ownership restrictions in the Company's bylaws, as IAG is required to have such restrictions due to applicable legal and regulatory requirements of the aviation sector.\n- \u00b7 Recommendations number 4, 42, 45 and 54; in relation to the amendments introduced to these recommendations in June 2020, the Company was not able to update the relevant internal policies and the Board of Directors Regulations before December 31, 2020. The IAG Board will consider the relevant amendments and policy changes to bring the Company in line with these requirements within the first quarter of/uni00A02021.\n- \u00b7 Recommendation number 52 regarding the rules on the composition and operation of non-mandatory board committees, because IAG's Safety Committee is chaired by an executive director, the Group Chief Executive, and not by an independent director as recommended by the Code. In this respect, on February 25, 2021 the Board reviewed its regulations and approved separate regulations for each Board advisory committee. As part of this review, it was decided to combine the support provided to the Board over safety matters with those related to environmental and corporate responsibility matters under a new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee. The composition of this Committee is fully compliant with the recommendation 52 of the Spanish Code.\n\nAs far as the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code is concerned, the Company considers that it has complied with almost all of the Code provisions. The Company considers it is not in alignment with Provision 36 of the Code, as it has not developed a formal policy for postemployment shareholding requirements, but as explained in the Directors' Remuneration Report, it will approve such a policy as part of the changes to be introduced in the revised remuneration policy that it is due to be submitted to shareholders for approval during 2021.\n\nOver the past year, work on culture and workforce engagement was primarily carried out at the level of the Group's various companies.  Both the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the Group's leadership have led to a reconsideration of these matters both within the Board of Directors and the Management Committee itself.\n\nFollowing the review of its corporate governance framework, the Board will have direct oversight over corporate culture and governance to support and monitor these matters at main board level.\n\nAt the same time, it has been agreed to reallocate oversight of environmental and corporate responsibility matters from the Audit and Compliance Committee to the new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, thus alleviating the workload of the former and providing a closer and more specialised monitoring environment.\n\nIn addition, within the Management Committee, a new position has been created with responsibility for culture, talent and sustainability to promote and coordinate these areas at Group level.\n\nIn taking these steps, IAG's Board and Management Committee are reinforcing their commitment to ESG, especially at a time when the Group is seeking to rebuild itself as it overcomes the crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Key principles of the 2018 Corporate Governance Code\n\n| Board Leadership                        |   95 |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|\n| Division of responsibilities            |  103 |\n| Composition, Succession and  Evaluation |  108 |\n| Audit, Risk and Internal Control        |  114 |\n| Remuneration                            |  124 |",

It centralises the Group's corporate functions, including the development of its global platform. IAG sets the long-term vision for the Group, defines portfolio attractiveness and makes capital allocation decisions. Further details on the Group structure and corporate governance framework is included further on in this/uni00A0report.\n\nThe IAG Board is collectively responsible for the long-term sustainable success of the Group. As stated in its Regulations, the Board shall endeavour to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests, as applicable, of the employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders that might be affected, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the environment. Examples of this long-term focus and consideration of stakeholders' interest are discussed further on in this report and in the stakeholder section. In addition to this, each operating company has an individual brand and cultural identity, is responsible for the management of their respective businesses and accountable for the implementation of the joint business and synergy plans.\n\n## The IAG Board\n\nThe Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to the Group Chief Executive and the Group's management team but it has reserved for itself the authority on a number of matters detailed in article 3.4 of the Board Regulations, which are available on the corporate website (www.iairgroup.com).\n\nThe Board's primary responsibilities are summarised further on in this report.\n\nEach Board meeting starts with a report from each of the committee's chairs on the key discussions and decisions considered by the respective committees, providing an opportunity for directors to comment or ask questions on the matters dealt with by each committee. This is followed by a general update from the Group Chief Executive Officer and subsequently, from the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nWith support from the General Counsel and the Board Secretary, the Chairman sets a carefully structured agenda for each meeting in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. The Board has a 12-month rolling planner including both standard items and specific topics. During 2020, the Board activities and oversight of the business was adjusted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The key activities of/uni00A0the Board in 2020 are detailed in the/uni00A0Board activities table further on in this/uni00A0report.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThe IAG Board currently comprises eight/uni00A0independent non-executive directors, two proprietary non-executive directors and one executive director, IAG's Chief Executive Officer. The biographies of each member of the Board/uni00A0are set out in the Board of Directors/uni00A0section.\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting on September 8, 2020, Luis Gallego was appointed as an executive director of the Company and its Chief Executive Officer following the retirement of Willie Walsh. Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips were appointed as proprietary non-executive directors at the proposal of Qatar Airways, IAG's biggest shareholder, with Kieran Poynter and Marc Bolland retiring from the/uni00A0Board.\n\nAs part of the plans implemented to ensure that the Group's EU licensed airlines continue to comply with EU ownership and control rules following Brexit, the composition of the IAG Board of Directors was changed so that it has a majority of independent EU non-executive directors. To this effect, on December 31, 2020 Deborah Kerr, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda and Steve Gunning stepped down from the Board and Peggy Bruzelius, Eva Castillo and Heather Ann McSharry were appointed as new members. Steve Gunning's executive functions as Chief Financial Officer remain unchanged.\n\nAs set out in the Company's Bylaws the Board shall comprise a minimum of nine and a maximum of 14 members. As of December 31, 2020, the Board composition was:\n\n| Name of Board Member   | Position/Category           | First appointed   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Antonio V\u00e1zquez        | Chairman                    | May 25, 2010 1    |\n| Luis Gallego           | Chief Executive             | September 8, 2020 |\n| Alberto Terol          | Senior Independent Director | June 20, 2013     |\n| Giles Agutter 2        | Director (Proprietary)      | September 8, 2020 |\n| Peggy Bruzelius        | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Eva Castillo           | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Margaret Ewing         | Director (independent)      | June 20, 2019     |\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n          | Director (independent)      | June 20, 2019     |\n| Heather Ann McSharry   | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Robin Phillips 2       | Director (Proprietary)      | September 8, 2020 |\n| Emilio Saracho         | Director (independent)      | June 16, 2016     |\n| Nicola Shaw            | Director (independent)      | January 1, 2018 3 |\n\n- 1 Antonio V\u00e1zquez retired from the Board on January 7, 2021.

Following the Board evaluation and the review of the Board and committees' remits, it was decided to include sustainability matters within the existing Safety Committee, reviewing its remit and composition. The Board approved new and separate regulations for each one of the Board committees in its February 2021 meeting. These/uni00A0regulations are available on the corporate website.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic from April the Board held weekly/bi-weekly meetings bringing the total meetings held during the reporting period to 42.\n\nSome of these meetings were needed to be held at short notice in order to properly monitor business developments, support management during this difficult period and to make critical decisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This illustrates director's individual and collective commitment to the Company.\n\nThe annual two-day strategy meeting was postponed and held in December allowing\n\nthe new Chief Executive Officer and the management team to present their initial consideration on the required transformation of the Group.\n\nDuring 2020, the Chairman and the non-executive directors met privately following each scheduled Board meeting. In addition to this, the Senior Independent Director also met with the non-executive directors, without the Chairman, as part of the chair succession planning process.\n\nAs stated in the Board Regulations, directors shall make their best efforts to attend Board meetings. If this is not possible, they may grant a proxy to another director, although non-executive directors may only grant their proxy to another non-executive director.

        "page_content": "## Culture and stakeholder engagement\n\nDuring 2020, IAG continued working under the same framework, based on its vision 'to be the world's leading airline group, maximizing sustainable value creation for our shareholders and customers' and the values that derive from the Code of Conduct approved in 2019. This Code that applies to all directors and employees of the Group, establishes simple integrity and compliance values applicable across the Group while respecting the different cultures and values existing in each of the operating companies.\n\nAlthough compliance and training activities were carried out to support awareness of the principles detailed in the IAG Code of Conduct, the COVID-19 pandemic and the delay in the change of leadership, postponed some of the Group's plans in this area, but each of the operating companies continued with their own programmes and initiatives during the year. The IAG Board was regularly and closely informed of these initiatives. A specific case study regarding IAG Tech, a crucial area for the Group which works across the different business units, is provided opposite.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2020, a Group wide exercise was completed with external support. The survey has been designed to help understand the key leadership and cultural elements that are required to build a consistently high performing organisation. As the Group seeks to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey sought to identify strengths to build on, opportunities for improvement, and obstacles standing in the way of IAG being the leading airline group. The results and initial conclusions from this exercise were shared with the Board during the two-day strategy meeting held in December, during a session devoted to culture and talent.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has also reviewed and reported to the Board on the effectiveness and functioning of the confidential speak up channels available throughout the Group, where concerns can be raised on a confidential basis, and the number and nature of incidents reported to the speak up channels during 2020.\n\nThe Board continued to be updated throughout 2020 in relation to each operating company's employee matters as part of the report each company presents to the Board, in addition to specific matters that were conveyed as part of the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing reporting. In particular, information was shared with the Board on the COVID-19 specific measures adopted across the Group to support employee safety and wellbeing.\n\n## IAG Tech culture journey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG Tech was launched at the end of 2019, following my appointment as IAG CIO, bringing together over 1,500 digital and IT professionals across the Group, with a renewed mission to accelerate business performance, enable employees and protect the business through the use of technology and data.\n\nIAG Tech has refocused around a common vision of bringing Technology Excellence to everything we do and started a transformative journey, where a single identity and a common vision purpose and values are key. These common values are innovation, empowerment, professionalism, transparency and agility.\n\nDuring 2020, we have redefined the IAG Tech operating model and placed people at the heart of everything we do. As part of this effort, we have appointed our own Head of People and Culture emphasising the importance of nurturing culture and providing a focal point to hold everyone accountable.\n\nWhen recruiting externally as well as when promoting people, there is a special focus to ensure the continuity and consolidation of IAG Tech's common values. Our own leadership academy is playing a key role in ensuring the right values and culture, as well as the right behaviours are fostered.\n\nIAG Tech's targeted culture is underpinned by five people themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Engagement to ensure people are motivated, energised, happy, healthy and fulfilled. This is driven by widespread communication to capture our employees voice so we can include their views in any decisions we take, a focus on mental and physical wellbeing, encouraging a positive work/life balance, embracing diversity in every way, making everyone feel included and valued, being strong advocates for environment, social and governance activities inside and outside work, a strong and supportive network of IT/ Digital professionals, and fostering the right working environment.\n- \u00b7 Talent Management aiming to ensure IAG Tech has the best people with the right skills at the right time. A strategic resource plan will be prepared in 2021 contemplating talent acquisition and onboarding, a new graduate and apprentice programme, a pipeline to identify and develop our people, succession and retention plans, and opportunities for growth and progression.\n- \u00b7 Recognition framework allowing us to identify and celebrate great performance and examples of people living our values and behaviours.\n- \u00b7 Performance Management directly linking everyone's objectives to our goals and targets, and KPIs and metrics so our people understand how they are personally contributing to achieving our vision, purpose and the business outcomes. We believe in fair, transparent and continual feedback.\n- \u00b7 Learning and Development enabling us to have the right capabilities, skills and competencies needed to deliver the business outcomes and our vision of Technology Excellence whilst ensuring that our people feel they can grow and progress.\n\nIAG Tech participated in the Group's Organisation Health Index and other employee satisfaction surveys in 2020. Although we are still analysing the feedback received from the Organisation Health Index completed in December 2020, we acknowledge that we are only at the start of a long journey to create a world class culture. In order to support our journey, we have a robust plan as part of Project Magna (IAG Tech transformation programme) to continue to define, embed and nurture our culture. To complete this effort and to measure progress, we have planned an internal audit of our culture in 2021.\n\n## John Gibbs\n\nIAG CIO",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders\n\nShareholders' interests have always been present in the Board's considerations. The Board engages directly in active dialogue with shareholders and investors mainly through the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman, who regularly meet with shareholders and investors. In addition, the/uni00A0Senior Independent Director has attended meetings at the request of certain shareholders. In January to March 2020, meetings were conducted in person, but from April onwards meetings have been/uni00A0conducted by telephone or by virtual/uni00A0means.\n\nThe Board is regularly appraised of shareholders' feedback and the main issues discussed with or raised by shareholders and investors. During 2020, the Company's brokers and other financial advisors gave a number of presentations to the Board to report on specific topics, including the capital increase, as well as the macro economic environment.\n\nIn July 2020, the IAG Board proposed the execution of a capital increase, which was approved at the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and was completed in October 2020. As part of this, a full roadshow was held with major shareholders on the day of the announcement and the subsequent days, and also several meetings were conducted in the month of September with numerous members of IAG's shareholder base and key potential investors, mainly across Europe and the US.\n\nIn addition, a wide campaign was launched to ensure retail shareholders were duly informed and provided the opportunity to participate exercising their pre-emptive rights or selling the corresponding subscription rights. As the capital increase was conducted under Spanish law, which differs from the UK rules, the Company launched a retail campaign in relation to its UK retail shareholders to ensure they were made aware of the process, of the relevant key dates to participate in the capital increase, as well as the fact that those who took no action would not be entitled to receive compensation for any unused and expired subscription rights and that their shareholding will be diluted, this being an important difference in relation to UK practice.\n\nThis retail campaign included contact centres both in the UK and Spain which provided support with shareholder queries in relation to the process, and the preparation of a shareholder guide including frequently asked questions which was made available on the corporate website, as well as media campaigns both in the UK and Spain.\n\nAt the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting, the 2019 report on directors' remuneration (resolution 8) was passed with 71.60% of the votes. As publicly stated, while the Board welcomed the majority support for this report, it was disappointed that 20.56%\n\nvoted against this resolution. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code recommendation, the Company completed an analysis of the voting results in order to identify those shareholders in the Top 100 who voted against or abstained on this resolution. Following this, a consultation process was launched in November 2020, including the main proxy advisory firms and more than 30 institutions that represent approximately half of the dissenting vote.\n\nThe main conclusion drawn from the conversations held were, while it was recognised that bonuses were determined at the end of February 2020 and paid in respect of the financial year to December 2019, these investors would have expected the implementation of exceptional measures in light of the financial situation of the Company and also to reflect the stakeholder experiences of employees and shareholders. They welcomed the salary reduction and other measures put in place by the Company and did not express any concern regarding IAG's current remuneration policy.\n\n## Considering stakeholders' interests\n\nAs explained in the stakeholder section of the report, IAG's engagement framework is articulated in accordance with the Group's business model. In line with this, the relationship with certain stakeholders is managed at an operating company level, as is the case of customers, employees, and, to a certain extent in the case of airline partners and industry associations, or governments and regulators. This ensures that the relationship is established as closely as possible and within the relevant cultural and business context. This does not preclude that the Group coordinates certain activities and sets minimum standards or\n\nguidance as far as this is deemed appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the relationship with shareholders and investors is conducted at IAG level, mainly through the investor relations department, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Chief Executive Officer and the IAG Chairman. Engagment with debt and operating lease providers is also done at IAG level to ensure a strategic and consistent approach across the Group.\n\nIAG GBS provides a centralised procurement function for the Group and generally manages supplier engagement.\n\nAs far as sustainability matters are concerned, these are coordinated at Group level, covering the Group policies and objectives, governance structure, risk management, strategy and targets on material issues, sustainability performance indicators, communications and stakeholder engagement plans. Each individual operating company within the Group has a distinct sustainability programme that is aligned with the Group strategy. In 2020, the Board decided to reinforce its focus on this important area assigning this responsibility to a separate Board committee which can provide a closer oversight and support to this function. In February 2021, the Board decided to enhance the remit of the existing Safety Committee to fulfil this objective as a new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee. Further details on IAG's sustainability governance and engagement with stakeholders on sustainability can be found in the 'Sustainability' section.\n\nThe following graph details how the Board is kept informed in relation to IAG's key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They should provide guidance and advice but also a constructive challenge to the executive team.\n\nThe Board, as reported by the Nominations Committee, is satisfied that those directors classified as independent are free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with exercising an independent judgement, both as a question of character and judgement. Directors are required to provide the Nominations Committee with relevant information regarding potential conflict of interest that may arise, any positions that they hold or activities they perform at other companies or entities, as well as any substantial change that may affect their independence.\n\nThe shareholders' meeting held on September 8, 2020 approved the appointment of Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips as non-executive proprietary directors as proposed by IAG's significant shareholder Qatar Airways Group (Q.C.S.C.). Qatar Airways, a Middle East air carrier headquartered in Doha, has been the single largest shareholder of IAG since 2016, owning, as of the date of this report, 25.1% of the share capital of the Company. Throughout this period there has been a long-standing business and commercial relationship between Qatar Airways and the airlines of the IAG Group. This close relationship of commercial cooperation, which has always been undertaken on an arms-length and commercial basis, significantly reduces the potential existence of permanent conflicts of interest between Qatar Airways and the Group's airlines. Any potential conflict of interest that might affect the new proprietary directors is managed by applying the duty to abstention in accordance with the procedure for managing conflicts of interest described/uni00A0below.\n\nAs far as the relationship of the proprietary directors with the significant shareholder who proposed their appointments is concerned, it should be noted that Giles Agutter is the owner and Chief Executive of the consultancy services firm Southern Sky Limited, one of whose material clients is Qatar Airways Group, and that Robin Phillips has no relevant connection with Qatar Airways Group.\n\nAll schedule Board meetings include a private session for non-executive directors to meet with the Chairman.\n\n## Directors' disclosure duties, conflicts/uni00A0of/uni00A0interests, and related party/uni00A0transactions\n\nDirectors must inform the Company of any participation or interest they may hold or acquire in any company that is a/uni00A0competitor of the Group, or any activities that could place them in conflict with the corporate interest.\n\nAccording to article 21 of the Board Regulations, directors have an obligation to adopt the measures necessary to avoid conflict of interest situations. These include any situation where the interest of the director, either directly or through third parties, may conflict with the corporate interest or with his duties to the Company. In the event of conflict, the affected director must inform the Company and abstain from participating in the discussion of the transaction referred to by the conflict. For the purposes of calculating the quorum and voting majorities, the affected director would be excluded/uni00A0from the number of members/uni00A0in attendance.\n\nIn accordance with article 3.4 of the Board Regulations, the Board of Directors has the exclusive authority to/uni00A0approve transactions with the directors, with shareholders that have a/uni00A0significant holding or with any persons related to/uni00A0them.\n\nThe execution of these type of transactions or any transaction which may/uni00A0entail a conflict of interest need to/uni00A0be/uni00A0reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee to ensure that they are carried out at arm's length and with due observance of/uni00A0the principle of equal treatment of/uni00A0shareholders. In the case of transactions that fall within the ordinary course of business and are customary or recurring in nature and following a report/uni00A0by the Audit and\n\nCompliance Committee,/uni00A0the Board may grant a general authorisation as long as they are executed under certain terms and conditions. This authorisation needs to be endorsed/uni00A0by the shareholders' meeting in those cases established in the Spanish companies' legislation and, in particular, in any transaction with a director valued/uni00A0at more than 10 per cent of/uni00A0corporate assets.\n\nIn addition to this, and prior to the Audit/uni00A0and Compliance Committee consideration, shareholder related party transactions are also reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and are reported to the IAG Head of Group Audit.\n\nIAG maintains commercial relationships with Qatar Airways, including cargo capacity agreements, passenger codeshares, wet leases and interline agreements. As a significant shareholder, all of these transactions have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committee and approved by the Board.\n\n## Board information and training\n\nAll Board and committee meeting documents are available to all directors, including the minutes of each meeting. All directors have access to the advice of the Board Secretary and the Group General Counsel. Directors may take independent legal, accounting, technical, financial, commercial or other expert advice at the Company's expense when it is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. No such independent advice was sought in the 2020 financial year.\n\nIn 2020 the Board received specific briefings on key developments, such as the ongoing negotiations regarding the UK's exit from the EU, and specific briefings regarding directors' duties and liabilities under Spanish and UK law, as well as regarding corporate governance developments both in Spain and the UK.\n\nDirectors are offered the possibility to update and refresh their knowledge of the business and any technical related matter on an ongoing basis to enable them to continue fulfilling their responsibilities effectively. Directors are consulted about their training and development needs and given the opportunity to discuss training and development matters as part of their annual individual performance evaluation.",

At the end of their mandate, directors may be re-elected one or more times for periods of equal duration to that established in the Bylaws. In this way, the Company complies with the UK Code recommendation that directors should be subject to annual re-election.\n\nRe-election proposals are subject to a formal process, based on the Nominations Committee proposal in the case of/uni00A0non-executive directors, or its recommendation report for executive directors. This proposal or report is prepared having due regard to the performance, commitment, capacity, ability and availability of the director to continue to contribute to the Board with/uni00A0the knowledge, skills and experience/uni00A0required.\n\nDirectors cease to hold office when the term of office for which they were appointed expires.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, a director must resign in the cases established in article 17.2 of the Board Regulations, among other things when the director ceases to have the good standing, suitability, reliability, competence, availability or commitment to office necessary to be a director of the Company or when his or her remaining on the Board might affect the Company's crediibility or reputation or otherwise jeopardises its interests.\n\nAccording to article 24.2 of the Board Regulations, directors have a number of disclosure obligations, including the duty to inform the Company of circumstances that might harm the Group's name or reputation. In particular, if they become subject to any judicial, administrative or other proceedings. In such circumstances, the Board would consider the case as soon as practicable and adopt the decisions it deems fit, taking into account the corporate interest. As stated previously, if remaining on the Board would affect the Company's reputation, or otherwise jeopardise its interest, a director must\n\nplace their position at the disposal of the Board and, at its request, formally resign.\n\nThe Board may only propose the removal of a non-executive director before the end of the mandate when it considers there is just cause, following a report by the Nominations Committee. For/uni00A0these purposes, just cause is deemed to/uni00A0exist when the director takes up new positions or enters into new obligations that prevent them from dedicating the necessary time to the performance of his or her duties as a director, otherwise breaches his or her duties as a director or unexpectedly becomes subject to any of the circumstances provided for in article 16.2 of the Board Regulations. The removal may also be proposed as a result of takeover bids, mergers or other similar corporate transactions that determine a material change of control.\n\nA director who stands down before the end of their term of office must state their reasons in a letter to be sent to all the directors.

If the shares with respect to which the aforementioned obligations have been breached represent at least 0.25 per cent of the Company's share capital in nominal value, the Board may also direct that no/uni00A0transfer of any such shares shall be/uni00A0registered.\n\n## Limitations on ownership of shares\n\nIn the event that the Board deems it/uni00A0necessary or appropriate to adopt measures to protect an operating right/uni00A0of the Company or of its subsidiaries, in light of the nationality of its shareholders or any persons with an interest in the Company's shares, it may adopt any of the measures provided for/uni00A0such purpose in article 11 of the Bylaws, including the determination of a maximum number of shares that may be held by non-qualifying shareholders provided that such maximum may not be lower than 40 per cent of the Company's share capital. If such a determination is made and notified to the stock market, no further acquisitions of shares by nonqualifying persons can be made.\n\nIn such circumstances, if non-qualifying persons acquire shares in breach of such restriction, the Board may also (i) agree on the suspension of voting and other political rights of the holder of the relevant shares, and (ii) request that the holders dispose of the corresponding shares so that no non-qualifying person may directly or indirectly own such shares or have an interest in the same. If such transfer is not performed on the terms provided for in the Bylaws, the Company may acquire the corresponding shares (for their subsequent redemption) pursuant to applicable legislation. This acquisition must be performed at the lower of the following prices: (a) the book value of the\n\ncorresponding shares according to the latest published audited balance sheet of the Company; and (b) the middle market quotation for an ordinary share of the Company as derived from the London Stock Exchange's Daily Official List for the business day on which they were acquired by the relevant non-qualifying/uni00A0person.\n\n## Impact of change of control\n\nThe following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination in/uni00A0the event of a change of control of the/uni00A0Company:\n\n- \u00b7 the brand alliance agreement in respect of British Airways and Iberia's membership of one world, the globallybranded airline alliance, could be terminated by a majority vote of the parties in the event of a change of control of the Company;\n- \u00b7 the joint business agreement between British Airways, Iberia, American Airlines and Finnair and the joint business agreement between British Airways, Japan Airlines and Finnair can be terminated by the other parties to those agreements in the event of a change of control of the Company by either a third-party airline, or the parent of a third-party airline; and\n- \u00b7 certain IAG financing and fuel arrangements allow for prepayment, redemption or early termination in certain circumstances if there is a change of control of the Company.\n\nIn addition, the Company's share plans contain provisions as a result of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable on a change of control of the Company in accordance with the rules of the plans.\n\n## Directors' and Officers' liability/uni00A0insurance\n\nThe Company has purchased insurance/uni00A0against Directors' and Officers' liability for the benefit of the directors and/uni00A0officers of the Company and its/uni00A0subsidiaries.",

The oversight of the succession arrangements for both the Chief Executive and, as far as appropriate as this process was led by the Senior Independent Director, for the Board Chair/uni00A0position were also key areas of consideration. The Committee was also consulted on appointments to, and promotions within, the IAG Management/uni00A0Committee.\n\nI have covered in detail all the changes made during the year in my introduction to the Corporate Governance Report. As far as the Board is concerned, I would add that after a year with significant changes, we are very pleased with the outcome, having a Board with very solid and diverse set of skills, experience and capabilities. We are especially satisfied to have reached a female representation of 45%, but we recognise that there is more to do in other areas, such as ethnicity, as well as to ensure the development of diversity in its broadest sense in senior management across the Group.\n\nFollowing executive leadership changes, the Committee's key priority for 2021 will be to focus on IAG's succession and talent management plans, as well as to reinforce the diversity of our pipeline.\n\nI am convinced that the Group starts this new phase of its development with a strong board and senior management team with the breadth of skills, experience, capabilities and perspectives necessary to respond to the demands and challenges the business and the Group faces.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nNominations Committee Chair\n\n## The Nominations Committee\n\nThe composition, competencies and operating rules of the Nominations Committee are regulated by article 31 of the Board Regulations and by the Nominations Committee Regulations as approved by the Board on February 25, 2021. A copy of the Board and the new Nominations Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has overall responsibility for leading the process for appointments to the Board and to ensure that these appointments bring the necessary skills, experience and competencies to the Board, aligning its/uni00A0composition to the business strategy and/uni00A0needs. The Committee also reports to the Board on the proposed appointment of senior executives of the Company. It oversees Board and senior management succession planning and in general the/uni00A0development of a diverse pipeline for/uni00A0succession.\n\nThe Nominations Committee shall be made/uni00A0up of no less than three nonexecutive directors appointed by the Board, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out its function. A/uni00A0majority of the members must/uni00A0be independent directors that are EU/uni00A0nationals.\n\nThe Committee was chaired by Antonio V\u00e1zquez until September 8, 2020, when he was replaced by Javier Ferr\u00e1n. Antonio V\u00e1zquez remained a member until he retired from the Board on January 7, 2021.\n\nThe former members of the Committee during 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Antonio V\u00e1zquez left January 7, 2021\n- \u00b7 Marc Bolland left September/uni00A08,/uni00A02020\n- \u00b7 Deborah Kerr left December/uni00A031, 2020\n- \u00b7 Emilio Saracho left September 24, 2020",

        "page_content": "## The Committee's responsibilities\n\nThe Nominations Committee's responsibilities can be summarised as:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the mix of competencies, knowledge and experience necessary in the Board's membership/uni00A0and reviewing the criteria for the/uni00A0Board/uni00A0composition and the selection of/uni00A0candidates\n- \u00b7 submitting the recommendation for appointment of directors to the Board for approval, and reporting on the proposed designations of the members of the Board committees and their chairs\n- \u00b7 succession planning for Board members making proposals to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board so that such succession/uni00A0occurs in a planned and orderly manner\n- \u00b7 reporting to the Board on the appointment and removal of senior/uni00A0executives (which includes all IAG Management Committee members)\n- \u00b7 ensuring that non-executive directors/uni00A0receive appropriate induction/uni00A0programmes\n- \u00b7 setting diversity targets (gender, ethnicity and other criteria) both within the senior management and the succession pipeline\n- \u00b7 ensuring that plans are in place for orderly succession of senior management positions whilst safeguarding the achievement of agreed diversity targets establishing a target for female representation on the Board which should adhere to the Company's Directors Selection and Diversity Policy\n- \u00b7  coordinating the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board and its/uni00A0committees\n\n## The Committee's activities in 2020\n\nThe Committee met nine times during 2020, including five scheduled meetings and four ad hoc meetings. Directors' attendance at these meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance section. The Group Chief Executive is invited to attend the/uni00A0Committee's meetings as and when/uni00A0necessary. During 2020, the Group General Counsel also attended several meetings.\n\nThe Committee focused on the following activities during the year:\n\n- \u00b7 Group Chief Executive succession and appointment of Luis Gallego\n- \u00b7 Board Chair succession plan and appointment of Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n- \u00b7 the composition of the Board, including Brexit considerations\n- \u00b7 reviewing the Board committees' membership\n- \u00b7 annual evaluation of performance of the Board Chair and of the Chief Executive\n- \u00b7 management succession plans\n- \u00b7 talent management, pipeline and/uni00A0diversity\n- \u00b7 overview of the Board annual evaluation process and conclusions, as well as that of the Nominations Committee\n- \u00b7  changes to Group company boards\n\nThroughout the year, Spencer Stuart provided recruitment consultancy services to the Committee. Spencer Stuart does not have any other connection with the Company or individual directors and is a signatory to the UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.\n\n## Board changes\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews the formal succession plan for the Board, including analysis of non-executive directors' length of tenure, skills and experience, and planning for succession of any areas that would require strengthening from a skills and succession/uni00A0perspective. The conclusions of/uni00A0this exercise helped to inform new directors' searches and the profile and skills/uni00A0required.\n\nAs foreseen in the Board refreshment plan, Kieran Poynter did not stand for reelection at the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting having served as an independent director of the Company for more than nine years. Marc Bolland also did not stand for re-election having considered his non-IAG commitments and increased demand of these commitments on his time during 2020. To fill the vacancies this created, Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips were appointed as non-executive proprietary directors in representation of the significant shareholder Qatar Airways Group (Q.C.S.C.), owner of 25.1% of the share capital of the Company. These appointments were reviewed by the Nominations Committee, taking into consideration the composition of the Board of Directors, as well as the suitability of the professional profiles and experiences of the proposed directors.\n\nHaving served nine years in office and as anticipated, Antonio V\u00e1zquez announced on July 31, 2020 his intention to retire from his position as a member and Chair of the Board of Directors. In accordance with the succession process outlined further on in this report, the Board unanimously approved the appointment of Javier Ferr\u00e1n as his successor. Javier Ferr\u00e1n met the independence criteria set out in the Spanish legislation and in the 2018 UK Code on appointment.\n\nDue to the nature of our business and Brexit, IAG had to implement its plans to ensure that its EU licensed airlines continue to comply with EU ownership and control rules. In this context, the composition of the Board of Directors was changed so that it has a majority of independent EU non-executive directors. To facilitate these changes, on December 31, 2020 Deborah Kerr, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda and Steve Gunning stepped down from the Board, and Peggy Bruzelius, Eva Castillo and Heather Ann McSharry were appointed to fill these vacancies.\n\nThe search for these three new independent non-executive directors was initiated in 2019 by the Nominations Committee in accordance with the Board succession plan and was later redefined to identify suitable/uni00A0candidates to ensure that the/uni00A0Board had a majority of independent EU non-executive/uni00A0directors.\n\nThis process was completed in accordance with the IAG Directors Selection and Diversity Policy, respecting the following/uni00A0principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Spencer Stuart was engaged to conduct this search.\n- \u00b7 The search criteria was formulated following the evaluation of the balance of skills, experience, independence, diversity and knowledge on the Board. Based on these considerations, the role/uni00A0and capabilities required for these appointments were established, and the resulting criteria were included as an/uni00A0annex to the search firm's engagement letter.\n- \u00b7 Two long-lists of candidates were reviewed during September and October 2020 and, following a detailed analysis of the profiles of the candidates included on both lists, it was agreed on a potential shortlist of candidates.\n- \u00b7 This shortlist was reviewed and discussed by the Chair of the Nominations Committee, the Board Chair and the Senior Independent Director, and according to the conclusions reached and after hearing the feedback from a compliance perspective from the Group General Counsel, it was reported to the Nominations Committee.\n- \u00b7  The interview process was completed between October and November 2020.\n\nFollowing this, the three candidates identified were agreed, and submitted for approval at the Nominations Committee held on December 31, 2020. A final report was presented to the Board endorsing the three candidates' nominations.",

        "page_content": "## Board positions and committee memberships\n\nThere has been a number of important changes to the Board composition and consequently to its committees, all of which have been overseen by the Nominations Committee.\n\nBeing a key position on the Board, succession for the chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee was carefully planned, ensuring an adequate handover process. Following the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting, Margaret Ewing succeeded Kieran Poynter in this position. Deborah Kerr and Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda resigned as members of the committee with effect from December 31, 2020. This committee membership includes Alberto Terol, who has been an IAG director for seven years providing his expertise and knowledge of the sector. Peggy Bruzelius and Eva Castillo were appointed as members of this/uni00A0committee on December 31, 2020 given their respective backgrounds and/uni00A0experience.\n\nFollowing his appointment as designated Chair, Javier Ferr\u00e1n was appointed as Chair of the Nominations Committee. Antonio V\u00e1zquez, incumbent Chair, continued as a member of this committee until his retirement. Alberto Terol, as Senior Independent Director is also a member and was throughout 2020. Current membership also includes Giles Agutter, Margaret Ewing and Heather Ann McSharry ensuring a balanced composition as well as adequate cross-membership with other key committees.\n\nOn December 31, 2020 Alberto Terol was appointed as chair of the Remuneration Committee. In a challenging period for this committee, Alberto brings not only his experience as a current member of this committee, but also his experience of having chaired other listed companies' remuneration committees. This committee also includes Nicola Shaw and Emilio Saracho, and recently appointed members Eva Castillo and Heather Ann McSharry, all of them with relevant backgrounds.\n\nOn February 24, 2021 the Nominations Committee considered the composition of the new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee which was subsequently approved by the Board. This committee will be chaired by an independent non-executive director, Nicola Shaw, and it will be exclusively composed of non-executive directors with a majority of independent directors, thus conforming to the Spanish Code requirements.\n\n## Directors independence, performance and re-election\n\nThe Nominations Committee, having considered the matter carefully, is of/uni00A0the/uni00A0opinion that all of the current non-executive directors, with the exception of the two recently appointed\n\nproprietary directors, are independent, both in line with the definition set out by/uni00A0the Spanish Companies Act and with/uni00A0that of the UK/uni00A0Corporate Governance Code, and/uni00A0are free from any/uni00A0relationship or/uni00A0circumstances that could affect,/uni00A0or/uni00A0appear to affect, their independent/uni00A0judgement.\n\nAll proposals for the appointment or re-election of directors presented to the/uni00A02020 Shareholders' Meeting were accompanied by an explanatory report issued by the Board of Directors with the support of the Nominations Committee assessing the competence, experience and merits of each candidate. Following this review, the Committee was of the opinion that each/uni00A0non-executive director submitting him or herself for re-election continued to demonstrate commitment to the role/uni00A0as a member of the Board and its committees, discharged his or her duties effectively and that each was making a/uni00A0valuable contribution to the leadership/uni00A0of/uni00A0the Company for the/uni00A0benefit/uni00A0of all shareholders.\n\nThe Committee also reviews the time commitment of each non-executive director on at least an annual basis. During/uni00A02020, the commitment, support and availability demonstrated by all directors without exception during these difficult months has been and continues to be outstanding.\n\nEach director is required to advise the Committee and seek its authorisation before accepting any external directorship or other significant appointment that might affect the time they are able to/uni00A0devote to the role as a director of the/uni00A0Company.\n\n## Management appointments and succession planning\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee reviewed and finalised the succession plan for the Group Chief Executive, which culminated with the announcement, in January 2020, that Luis Gallego, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberia, would succeed Willie Walsh as Group Chief Executive.\n\nIn addition to this, and as proposed by both the incumbent and designated Chief Executive, the Committee considered the appointment of Javier S\u00e1nchez-Prieto, the then Chairman and Chief Executive of Vueling, as Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberia, and of Marco Sansavini, the then Commercial Director of Iberia, as Chairman and Chief Executive of Vueling.\n\nInitially the appointments were due to take effect on March 26, 2020 but because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group's operations and the exceptional circumstances facing the airline industry, the Board decided to delay Willie Walsh's retirement as well as the relevant changes in the leadership of Iberia and Vueling to\n\npreserve management stability in the immediate response to the crisis. The appointments took effect following the Shareholders' Meeting held on September/uni00A08, 2020.\n\nIn addition, the Committee reviewed the following Management Committee appointments, which took effect on October 11, 2020, on the recommendation of the new Group Chief Executive:\n\n- \u00b7 Sean Doyle, then Aer Lingus Chairman and Chief Executive, appointed to succeed Alex Cruz as British Airways Chief Executive.\n- \u00b7 Donal Moriarty, then Aer Lingus Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, appointed interim Chief Executive in Sean's place.\n- \u00b7  Fernando Candela, then Chief Executive of LEVEL, appointed to the Management Committee in a new role of Chief Transformation Officer.\n\nIn January 2021, the Committee also considered and reported to the Board on the appointment of David Podolsky as the new IAG Chief Strategy Officer.\n\nIn 2020 a formal review of the senior management succession plan was not undertaken by the Committee other than in respect of the changes outlined above. This will be an area of focus both for the Committee and the Group Chief Executive and its management team during 2021.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Nominations Committee and the Board are committed to achieving diversity in its broadest sense in the composition of the Board and senior management. Details of Board diversity can be found in the Corporate Governance section. Female directors currently represent 45% of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee and the Board will be reviewing the Group's diversity and inclusion policies in 2021 to align to both the Spanish and UK Corporate Governance Codes' requirements as well as to current best practices. The Committee recognises that there is more to do in other areas beyond gender such as ethnicity and disability and will seek to further diversify the management and Board composition while recognising the difficulties it faces as far as the Board composition is concerned due to Spanish and UK governance and other relevant regulatory requirements.\n\nIAG's approach to inclusion and diversity on the Board is set out in the Company's Director Selection and Diversity Policy, available on the corporate website. The/uni00A0procedure for the appointment of directors follows the principles established in this policy, and, as recommended by the/uni00A0Spanish Good Governance Code, the/uni00A0Nominations Committee reviews compliance with this/uni00A0policy on a annual/uni00A0basis.",

Gender diversity principles are followed throughout the process, while preserving the general diversity and merit-based appointment principles established in the policy. The Board's policy is to consider candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds, without discrimination based on gender, race, colour, age, social class, beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, disability or other factors.\n\nSearches are conducted by selected executive search firms, only engaging with those who are signatories to the UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.

IAG is such a broad group of leading brands that it will no doubt take many months to get to know better the people that will work together to lead the company out of the current pandemic. The induction programme has highlighted the quality of talent that exists within the organisation and strengthened my confidence in the people to successfully adapt this company to the changing environment in which we operate. It has become clear to me the sense of pride that exists within the team for the companies that they have built, and this will no doubt continue to be a crucial asset for the company. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to work with the team in the months and years to come to ensure that IAG remains a leader in the global airline industry.\n\nGiles Agutter\n\nRobin Phillips\n\nGiven the pandemic, the induction process was necessarily more restricted: there were no site visits for example, and evidently in some cases the discussions needed to be online. Luis Gallego had formally taken over as Chief Executive only weeks before, and with several new faces in his leadership team. With this background, and given the\n\nunprecedented challenges facing the team, I was extremely impressed and very appreciative of the time, engagement and commitment of all who presented to us./uni00A0Importantly the sessions were highly interactive, and across the entire management team there was the preparedness to listen as well as speak. For those recently appointed,/uni00A0I sensed that our induction meetings also served as a platform to articulate some of their plans and aspirations in their new roles./uni00A0There was consistently a good balance in the discussion between/uni00A0the immediate/uni00A0priorities in confronting the\n\nmeeting exacting performance criteria and best practice standards in genderbalanced selection for FTSE 350 boards.\n\nTo ensure IAG meets its diversity standards, it requires that the long-list of potential candidates includes adequate representation of female candidates, and candidates, as far as possible, from the widest possible diverse pool. IAG Board's/uni00A0aspiration to have 33% female representation on the Board by the end of 2020 is formally reflected in the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy. This target was met in 2018, and as of today female directors have a 45% representation on the/uni00A0Board.\n\nThis policy also sets out IAG's commitment to strengthen the gender balance in IAG's leadership and senior management teams. IAG's Management Committee is responsible for improving diversity within management and generally across the Group. and the Nominations Committee monitors progress in achievement of management's diversity targets on a regular basis. The Nominations Committee is committed to improving diversity, and gender diversity in particular, across the\n\nGroup, and encourages and supports Group initiatives in this respect. Relevant details on diversity can be found in the/uni00A0Sustainability section.\n\n## Induction of directors\n\nAn induction programme was launched for Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips following their appointments in September 2020. The programme is based upon IAG's induction guidelines but has been adapted to take account of the COVID-19 pandemic constraints. Due to his appointment as IAG Chairman there has also been a further induction programme for Javier Ferr\u00e1n, including specialised one-to-one sessions as well as meetings with the leadership teams of each operating company. Handover sessions were also facilitated with the current Chairman to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nIn January 2021, another induction programme began to incorporate the three newly appointed directors following the same guidelines. In this regard, meetings with management have been arranged to prioritise a rapid introduction to the Group and briefings on main current matters, leading to a second phase of\n\npandemic and at the same time the focus on medium and longer term strategic goals. Overall, the approach was very diligent and demonstrated a clear respect for and understanding of the importance of the role of the board.\n\nThe preparation for the induction was thorough: not only ensuring that the broader remit and complexities of the group were fully represented and balanced, but also showing sensitivity to the key emerging issues and risks, for example cybersecurity, sustainability/ environment and Brexit.\n\nI emerged from the induction with a rounded understanding of the group, both across the business verticals and functions, and felt confident as a result in being able to carry out my role on the board, and critically also knowing that I have had the time to start to develop personal working relationships with the management team as well.",

The evaluation concluded that the/uni00A0Committee operated effectively during/uni00A02020 and has successfully managed two key succession processes at Board level, while dealing with important changes to the Board and its committees composition in very difficult circumstances. Two key areas of focus for the Committee during 2021/uni00A0will be:\n\n- \u00b7 talent oversight and deeper review of management succession planning, so that the Committee has greater visibility of the bench across functions, and\n- \u00b7  reinforcement of diversity and inclusion initiatives, ensuring that the Group builds a diverse talent pipeline aligned to its culture and values.\n\n## Chair succession\n\nLast year's annual report stated that, having completed nine years as a nonexecutive director, the succession arrangement for the Chair of the Board was one of the priorities for the Nominations Committee for 2020. This process was led by the Senior Independent Director, involving all non-executive\n\n## Board and committee evaluation\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board and its committees is reviewed annually, with an independent, externally facilitated review being conducted every three years. The last external review was conducted in 2019, therefore an internal evaluation was completed for/uni00A02020.\n\nThe internal evaluation was led by both/uni00A0the/uni00A0incumbent and designated Chair/uni00A0and was conducted by the Board Secretary using a self-assessment questionnaire, complemented with an individual interview conducted by the new Chair with each of the non-executive directors. The report was presented to all Board members, together with the Group General Counsel and the Board Secretary and Deputy Secretary.\n\nConsidering the amount of change experienced by both the Board and the committees' composition during 2020, as well as the current circumstances, the exercise was inevitably more limited but more focused at the same time on the key challenges faced during the year. The overall conclusions of the review were positive, confirming that the Board and the committees continue to adequately fulfil their responsibilities. Directors considered that the two important succession plans completed during the year were handle in a very solid and professional manner, both in relation to the process and identification of suitable candidates as in the design and\n\nimplementation of proper transition, acknowledging the compromise and collaboration of the departing Chief Executive and departing Chair. The planning of the Board succession and its execution was also positively commented on considering its relevance and depth in 2020. Specific questions were asked in the evaluation in relation to the Board's reaction to the COVID-19 crisis, both from a process and substance point of view. Directors concurred in considering that the engagement, support and oversight exercised by the Board during this difficult period has been outstanding. The strength of the different directors' profiles and their independent judgement was also put to test during this period and proved to be/uni00A0valuable.\n\nThe main focus for 2021 will be:\n\nTo accelerate and reinforce the induction programme for new directors, tailoring it to each director needs and profile, given the large amount of change in the Board's/uni00A0composition.\n\nIn view of the discussions held at the annual strategy session, to determine the strategic topics that should be covered in depth throughout the Board calendar.\n\nThe set up and functioning of the new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee.\n\ndirectors and executive directors. An internal potential candidate was identified very early in the process, and subsequently Alberto Terol decided to conduct the process jointly with the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee and longserving director, Kieran Poynter. Within this process, the input from executive directors, and particularly that of the incumbent and designated Chief Executive, were sought as appropriate.\n\nSeveral meetings with all non-executive directors were held where the role specification was discussed, including the skillset, experience and key leadership characteristics required to guide IAG throughout the next stage of the Group's development and to lead the Board and support management in confronting the challenges ahead. Spencer Stuart was engaged to complete a mapping exercise to identify potential chair candidates in accordance with the proposed role specification, which was also discussed and agreed with them. Following a first analysis of the long-list of potential candidates provided, a short list was prepared evidencing the existence of strong internal candidate. The short list was considered and discussed with all nonexecutive directors, excluding the already identified internal candidate. In addition the views of several major shareholders and advisors were also sought as part of the ordinary engagement contacts with these stakeholders.\n\nThe process resulted in a unanimous recommendation that Javier Ferr\u00e1n was the most suitable candidate, and such proposal was discussed at the Nominations Committee meeting held on July 29, 2020 and submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. Javier Ferr\u00e1n brings extensive board and governance experience, both in Spain and the UK, as well as a solid management expertise. Having been a director of the Company for more than a year at the date of approval of his appointment, the Board considered that his personal qualities and style perfectly matches the specifications required for the/uni00A0role.\n\nFollowing Javier Ferr\u00e1n's designation, the Committee considered the plan to induct him as Chair, working alongside Antonio V\u00e1zquez for the five months prior to his/uni00A0appointment.",

IAG's Safety Committee exercises a high-level overview of safety activities and fosters the discussion of common issues and the/uni00A0sharing of best practices between the Group airlines. This latter sphere of activity has proven very valuable in such unprecedented\n\ncircumstances as it allowed us to share challenges, initiatives and best practices among the different Group airlines.\n\n## Luis Gallego\n\nSafety Committee Chair\n\n## The Safety Committee\n\nThe Committee composition, competencies and operating rules were regulated by article 32 of the Board Regulations. Following the corporate governance review completed in February 2021, the remit of this Committee has been enhanced to cover environmental and corporate responsibility matters as a new Safety, Environmental and Corporate Responsibility Committee.\n\nThe Committee is made up of no fewer than three directors appointed by the Board, with the/uni00A0necessary dedication, capacity and experience.\n\nIn addition to Committee members, senior managers with responsibility for safety matters are invited to attend and report at/uni00A0Committee meetings as and when required. During 2020, representatives of the British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling safety teams attended meetings.\n\n## The Committee's responsibilities\n\nResponsibility for safety matters belongs to the Group's airlines. IAG, through its Safety Committee, has an overall view of each airline's safety performance and of any important issues that may affect the industry. The Committee also has visibility of the Group airlines' resources and procedures. Responsibility for performing\n\ndetailed and technical assessments remains with each airline, overseen by their/uni00A0respective safety committees.\n\nAccording to article 32 of the Board/uni00A0Regulations the Committee's duties/uni00A0included:\n\n- \u00b7 to receive significant safety information about IAG's subsidiaries, franchise codeshare or wet-lease providers used by any member of the Group\n- \u00b7 to exercise a high-level overview of safety activities and resources\n- \u00b7  to inform the Board and to follow up on any safety-related matters as determined by the Board\n\n## The Committee's activities during the year\n\nDuring 2020 the Committee held two meetings. Directors' attendance at these/uni00A0meetings is detailed in the Corporate Governance report.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the relevant areas of each operating company's performance across the Safety Risk Management activities. Although the reporting period included some pre COVID-19 operations, in the first quarter of 2020, a significant amount of the Committee's time after that was dedicated to the activities undertaken to ensure the effective management of risk as a consequence of the pandemic by each airline. This reflected the scale and pace of change following the restrictions imposed across the global operations and the impact on colleagues' skills, health and wellbeing and the continued airworthiness of the fleets. A substantial amount of work by each of the airlines' safety teams had been undertaken to manage safety risk that supported both citizen repatriation operations and the provision of cargo only services the details of which were shared with the Committee.\n\nFormer members of the Committee during 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Willie Walsh left September 8, 2020\n- \u00b7 Kieran Poynter left September 24, 2020\n- \u00b7 Javier Ferr\u00e1n left September 24 2020\n- \u00b7  Antonio Vazquez left January 7, 2021",

Despite the changes in composition, the Board is satisfied that, throughout the year, the Committee has retained competence relevant to its overall responsibilities and a wide range of financial, audit, risk management and relevant sector and business experience amongst its members, providing the right mix of skills and experience to provide constructive challenge and support to management. In accordance with the FRC's 2018 Code, the Board has determined that Margaret Ewing has recent and relevant financial experience. The Board, through the Nominations Committee, will continue to review the Committee's membership to ensure the skills and experience of its members align with the business as it develops.\n\nFormer members of the Committee during 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Kieran Poynter (Committee chair until September 8, 2020) left on September 8, 2020\n- \u00b7 Deborah Kerr left on December 31, 2020\n- \u00b7 Mar\u00eda Fernanda Meij\u00eda left on December 31, 2020\n\nAs noted in the Governance Report, Peggy/uni00A0Bruzelius and Eva Castillo joined the Committee, replacing Deborah Kerr and Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda, on December 31, 2020. I would like to thank Deborah and Mar\u00eda Fernanda for their valuable contribution to the Committee and welcome Peggy and Eva, who are already making an important impact on the Committee's agenda. Despite the recent changes, the Committee continues to have strong and diverse membership. It is well placed to provide robust challenge to the internal and external auditors and management. It also has the capability and/uni00A0expertise required to respond effectively to the significant and emerging opportunities and challenges faced by the/uni00A0Group.\n\nI would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Committee, to acknowledge and express our significant gratitude to management and teams (including internal auditors) who have interfaced with and provided support to the Committee during this period. We are incredibly proud of the way they have responded to the crisis and worked relentlessly with such determination and a real sense of purpose.\n\nThe Committee held twelve formal meetings during 2020 (compared to eight in 2019) and members held numerous ad hoc and one-to-one meetings with finance team representatives, management and internal and external auditors, reflecting the Committee's increased level of support and constructive challenge to management as the impact of the pandemic and the risk landscape evolved rapidly. As restrictions impacting IAG's business emerged globally, the associated potential effects on the control environment, cyber security and Group funding arrangements resulted in the Committee providing additional oversight and seeking supplementary assurance. The Committee also focused on the significant operational, compliance and financial risks\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nI am pleased to present my first Report as Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee. The unprecedented and significant challenges faced by the Group throughout the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the activities of the Committee during 2020. We ensured: the key challenges faced by the Group were reflected in the external and internal audit plans; effective controls remained in place; rapidly changing key and emerging risks were identified and effectively managed; continued compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations; and sound financial judgements and estimates continued to be made.\n\nI would like to start by thanking Kieran Poynter who stood down from the Board and as Chair of the Committee in September 2020, after ten years as a Non-Executive Director. During his time on the Committee Kieran made a significant contribution, playing a key role in advocating considerable and continuous improvement in the Group's internal control, risk management and compliance practices across the Group and ensuring that management was held accountable for delivering these improvements.",

KPMG commenced its transition in November and liaised with IAG and operating company and functional management, as well as the incumbent auditor, EY, to be well placed to embark on the 2021 audit. We would like to thank the EY team members for their consistent delivery of quality audits. The smooth transition of the external audit remains a key priority of the Committee during 2021.\n\nAs we look forward to this current year, 2021, the Committee will continue to provide robust challenge of management and our new auditor as governments' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to devastate the aviation sector and the risk environment consequently further evolves.

        "page_content": "## Viability and going concern assessments\n\n## Matter\n\n## Outcome/future actions\n\nThroughout the year and in finalising the 2020 Financial Statements and Annual Report, given the economic uncertainty arising from the global COVID-19 pandemic and the further uncertainty and impact of the UK leaving the EU, the Committee has considered and robustly challenged management's comprehensive going concern review and viability assessment, including the supporting analysis.\n\nManagement sense-checked the assumptions underlying the Base Case projections and Downside scenarios by comparison to forecasts available from informed external commentators (including IATA, analysts etc).\n\nThe Committee considered the enhanced level of assessment and rigour applied by management and agreed it was appropriate in light of the level of volatility in the external environment. The Committee considered management's rationale for assuming the Group would be able to raise additional financing over the agreed Viability assessment period.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the external auditor's findings and conclusions on this matter, particularly at half year and year end and their review of working capital for the purpose of the capital increase in September.\n\nThe Committee provided robust challenge of the assumptions applied in management's evolving Base Case projections (reflecting the deteriorating impact of the pandemic and related government responses), the severe but plausible Downside sensitivity scenarios and underlying assumptions and the reverse stress test scenario. Management responded to the Committee's concerns and, during the review in July provided additional granularity and insight in their analysis and assumptions, particularly in respect of the revenue and capacity forecasts. This was repeated in the year end review.\n\nFollowing this thorough challenge, the Committee recommended the viability and going concern statements and related disclosures to the Board for inclusion in the 2020 half year interim results announcement, the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts and preliminary results announcement, including a related 'material uncertainty' statement in respect of going concern and significantly expanded disclosures.\n\nThe Committee will continue to robustly monitor the Group's viability assessment going forward.\n\nThe Committee had regard to the recent going concern guidance issued by the FRC.\n\n## Capital increase, funding strategy and capital allocation\n\n## Matter\n\n## Outcome/future actions\n\nFollowing shareholder approval on September 8, 2020, IAG commenced a fully underwritten capital increase to raise gross proceeds of \u20ac2,741 million. The Committee provided robust and constructive challenge and support to management throughout the capital increase process, including the planning stages of the process, to ensure the existence of a strong rationale and business case. Throughout the process the Committee considered the views of the external auditor and reporting accountant.\n\nDue to the ongoing significant risk and implications for resilience and future viability resulting from trading challenges and other influences outside the control of the Group, the Committee has recently agreed with the Board that all funding strategy and capital allocation matters will be reviewed directly by the Board (rather than the Committee).\n\nSpecifically, the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the working capital statement. The nature of the Committee's review was the same as that applied in reviewing the going concern and viability assessments (see above).\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the Financial Position and Prospects Procedures (FPPP) report from the reporting accountant including challenging potential talent retention issues and the potential consequences for the effectiveness of the Group's processes and internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Challenged management on the level of credit risk associated with the proposed arrangements for the receipt of the funds from the capital raise. Management subsequently reached an alternative agreement with the banks involved in the capital increase, mitigating the risk in accordance with the Group's treasury policy.\n- \u00b7 Challenged the sufficiency of the Directors' and Officers' liability insurance cover considering the heightened risks and value associated with the capital increase. Additional cover was subsequently obtained for the period required.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and commented on various drafts of the Prospectus, providing appropriate assurance to the Board.\n- \u00b7 Considered management's accounting treatment of the rights issue, transaction costs and related disclosures.",

These exceptional items included discontinuance of hedges of fuel derivatives and foreign currency derivatives, impairment of fleet assets stood down, write-down of expendable inventories related to fleet impairment and restructuring costs.\n\nIn addition, certain other non-recurring material items (unrelated to the pandemic) were proposed as exceptional items by management, including the fine imposed in October 2020 from the UK Information Commissioner's Office relating to the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018.\n\nThe Committee reviewed management's process for measuring derivative hedges to be discontinued and for reviewing and testing potential impairment, considered the reasonableness of the judgements and estimates deriving the exceptional items and the rationale for classifying them as COVID-19 related. In addition, the Committee considered the external auditor's findings and conclusions.\n\nThe Committee debated with management the classification and disclosure of exceptional items in the financial statements with reference to the Group's policy, the views of the external auditor and the comment letters received from the CNMV (in October and December 2020 - see more detail below) plus further guidance issued by ESMA and the FRC.\n\nThe Committee concluded that the approach taken in respect of identifying exceptional costs arising purely as a result of COVID-19 was appropriate and has been applied in line with the Group's policy and guidance from the relevant regulators and the judgements and estimates applied in determining the value of the relevant exceptional costs were reasonable.\n\nThe Committee and management agreed that the Group's presentation of exceptional items in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts would be altered and only disclosed in notes to the financial statements, as part of the Alternative Performance Measures disclosure note.\n\n## Revenue recognition of IAG Loyalty contract with American Express\n\n## Matter\n\n## Outcome/future actions\n\nEffective from August 1, 2020, IAG Loyalty renewed its co-brand and marketing contracts with American Express through to 2028.\n\nWhile the performance obligations are consistent with the previous contract, the Committee considered management's proposed accounting treatment of two new aspects of the renewed contract, being an upfront payment for Avios points and an upfront sign-on bonus. Management had been advised by external professional experts, PwC.\n\nThe Committee concluded that, as a critical estimate/judgement in the Annual Report and Accounts. the approach taken, and related disclosures, in respect of determining the amortisation period, amortisation method and annual reassessment of the upfront payment were appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the supervision of the existence and effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting ('ICFR'). The Board has delegated the responsibility for the development of effective controls to the Chief Executive Officer and the supervision of the effectiveness of these controls to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Group's ICFR monitoring and auditing covers processes applied by the Company, Aer Lingus, IAG Loyalty, British Airways, IAG GBS, Iberia, and Vueling and covers processes performed by IAG GBS and IAG Cargo on behalf of the operating companies. The Committee reviews and validates the Group's approach to complying with the CNMV's ICFR recommendations.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee reviewed the results of the internal audits of ICFR (which included IT general controls) as well as the results of the external audit. Despite the operating conditions of 2020 and remote working or furlough being applied for the majority of employees, no material or significant weaknesses were identified, and management continued to improve the control environment across the Group. The Committee also tracked the progress of internal audit recommendations to address any weaknesses identified.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Committee considers and evaluates the level of Internal Audit resource and its quality, experience and expertise, supplemented as appropriate by thirdparty support and subject matter expertise, to ensure it is appropriate to provide the required level of assurance over the principal risks, processes and controls throughout the Group.\n\nThe Committee reviewed and approved the nature and scope of the work of Internal Audit throughout 2020. The half yearly audit plans were approved in January and July 2020 by the Committee, and all changes to the plan subsequently approved, including those to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapidly changing risk profile of the Group. The 2020 audit plans were adapted to include agile and real-time assurance over fraud risk while also ensuring coverage of specific risks, including cyber security, and satisfying ICFR and Spanish Criminal Code requirements. Progress against the plan and the results of Internal Audit's activities, including the quality and timeliness of management responses, was monitored throughout the year.\n\nThe Committee undertook an effectiveness review of the Internal Audit function and its leadership, which concluded that Internal Audit remains effective, has coped well with the challenges of the COVID-19\n\npandemic and continues to meet, adapt and add value to the needs of the Group.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee engaged throughout the year with EY, with the engagement partners attending all Committee meetings as well as a series of ad hoc meetings. The Committee Chair met with the Group and lead audit partners throughout the year, and more frequently at the public reporting periods, to review Group developments, audit progress and their planned reporting. The Committee also discussed with EY, prior to recommendation of the financial statements to the Board for approval, the audit findings, including audit differences, and observations on internal controls, operations and resources.\n\n## Scope and execution\n\nThe Committee discussed and agreed the scope of the audit with EY prior to the commencement of the year end audit, ensuring that the audit plan was robust and informed by the auditor's review of the first half of the year financial statements. EY set out for the Committee the key tests that they intended performing on the identified higher-risk audit areas that could lead to material misstatement of the financial statements and significantly influenced the audit plan. The auditor and the Committee confirmed a shared understanding of these risks and key audit matters, including going concern and viability, the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets, the accounting for all Group financing arrangements and how these were to be considered in the audit approach. In addition, the Committee provided input to management and EY on areas that it wanted to receive additional audit attention, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on current working from home practices (in respect of both IAG financial management and the audit team), loss of key people or any audit procedures involving physical inventory/uni00A0counts.\n\nThe auditor confirmed that 97 per cent (2019: 97 per cent) of the Group's revenue and 91 per cent (2019: 96 per cent) of the Group's total assets would be subject to a full scope audit and that specific scope procedures would be performed on IAG Loyalty and ICAG. The Committee challenged the auditor over the planned specific scope audit for IAG Loyalty and ICAG, however, following consideration of the combined coverage and clarification of the procedures adopted in a specific scope audit, the Committee agreed that the approach was appropriate and approved the plan.\n\nThe Committee agreed with EY, in considering the accuracy of financial reporting, the scale of accounting errors of lesser significance that were to be brought to the Committee's attention and the amounts that would need to be adjusted\n\nso that the financial statements give a true and fair view. For 2020, EY proposed a different methodology to determining the/uni00A0overall audit planning materiality compared to that applied in the prior year/uni00A0given the economic and financial consequences of COVID-19 on the Group's revenues and profitability. The Committee agreed that a significant reduction in materiality was appropriate, however challenged the method used in the calculation. The Committee was ultimately satisfied by the auditor's explanation that, regardless of the method adopted, a similar result would be obtained and, in all cases, lead to a significant reduction in the/uni00A0planning materiality compared to 2019/uni00A0and/uni00A0therefore the level of audit work, specifically sample sizes, required of the/uni00A0auditor.\n\n## External auditor quality and effectiveness\n\nThe Committee remains focused on audit quality and effectiveness, which is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure the rigour and challenge of the external audit process is maintained. The Committee assessed and measured the quality of the audit through monitoring the auditor's compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional guidance and assessed the audit team's qualifications, expertise, resources, partner rotation and the effectiveness of the audit process. The Committee's assessment included a detailed discussion with key executives and finance staff, which demonstrated that management regarded the quality of the EY audit and the audit team's overall performance as good. This aligned with the Committee's independent assessment of the overall quality of the audit, including the independence of EY and whether the auditor exhibited an appropriate level of challenge and scepticism in their work and dealings with/uni00A0management.\n\nIn particular, the Committee assessed the depth of review and level of challenge provided by the external auditor over the significant accounting judgements and estimates made by management. An example of where the Committee observed the external auditor demonstrate both professional scepticism and a challenge of management was in relation to the treatment of the ICO fine to British Airways as an exceptional item in the income statement. Whilst the Committee supported management's rationale for treating the item as exceptional, the Committee observed healthy debate initiated by EY which ensured that management's rationale was discussed in the Committee meetings throughout the year and the uncorrected misstatement in disclosure was included in the Board's letter of representation\n\nIn addition to the annual evaluation and regular review of reports and the working practices of the EY audit team, the",

        "page_content": "Committee undertook an ongoing assessment of external audit quality and effectiveness including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee oversaw formal terms of engagement with the auditor and agreed the audit fee. EY assured the Committee that the approved fee was at a level that was appropriate for the scope of the audit and to enable a quality audit to be undertaken.\n- \u00b7 Reports from the external auditor were reviewed during four Committee meetings in 2020 and again in January and February 2021 Committee meetings, covering: the conclusions of the review of the Group's results for the half year, interim audit findings, early warning report for year end matters, and final report for year end matters.\n\nEY attended all Committee meetings during the year, including ad-hoc meetings, to answer any questions the Committee had outside of these formal updates. The Committee is satisfied that the audit was probing, challenging and robust and the approach provided a reliable audit opinion with a reasonable expectation of detecting material errors, irregularities and material fraud. The Committee considered the external audit to have been effective and of a high quality.\n\n## External auditor reappointment\n\nHaving reviewed EY's performance during 2019, the Committee concluded that EY were independent and that it was in shareholders' interests to re-appoint the firm for 2020 before the transition of the audit to KPMG in 2021. The Board of Directors refrains from engaging any audit firm entitled to be paid fees by the Company for all services rendered that are in excess of 10 per cent of such firm's total revenue for the previous year. The EY lead audit and opinion signing partner for 2020 was Hildur Eir J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, who has held her role since 2016.\n\n## External audit tender and transition\n\nTo comply with the Spanish Act 22/2015, the Committee conducted an audit tender process that concluded in January 2020. KPMG's appointment as the auditor of the Company for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 was approved by shareholders at the General Meeting in September 2020. There were no contractual or similar obligations restricting the Group's choice of external auditor. KPMG confirmed its independence in November 2020 and the Committee has since reviewed and monitored the implementation of KPMG's transition plans.\n\n## External auditor non-audit services and independence\n\nNon-audit services provided by the external auditor are subject to a Boardapproved policy that prohibits certain categories of work and controls the overall level of expenditure. The Company complies voluntarily with the revised UK standards in relation to non-audit services.\n\nThe Committee reviews the nature and volume of projects undertaken by the external auditor on a quarterly basis and all projects are either pre-approved in line with the list of permitted services in the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard 2019 or approved by the Committee Chair for projects over \u20ac100,000 or of an unusual nature. The overall volume of work is addressed by a target annual maximum of \u20ac1.6 million with an additional allowance of up to \u20ac1.2 million for large projects where the external auditor is uniquely placed to carry out the work.\n\nAverage spend across the last three years was within the total target maximum. Spend in 2020 was \u20ac1,134,000 with an additional \u20ac1,238,000 relating to work performed on working capital and FPPP reviews for the capital increase completed in October, required under the regulations and most effectively performed by the statutory auditor. 20 per cent of the \u20ac1,134,000 spend related to recurring work on the audit of accounts required by the Group's Joint Business arrangements. Details of the fees paid to the external auditor during the year can be found in note 6 to the Group financial statements.",

This is my first report as Chairman of the Committee, having taken over the role from Deborah Kerr, who herself took over the role in September 2020 from Marc Bolland. I would like to thank Marc and Deborah for their contributions during their time as Chair of/uni00A0the Committee and I am very much looking forward to serving you in this new/uni00A0role.\n\nFormer members of the Committee during 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Marc Bolland (Committee chair until September 8, 2020) left September 8, 2020\n- \u00b7 Deborah Kerr (Committee chair from/uni00A0September 8, 2020) left December/uni00A031,/uni00A02020\n- \u00b7 Javier Ferr\u00e1n left September 24, 2020\n- \u00b7  Mar\u00eda Fernanda Mej\u00eda left December 31, 2020\n\nAs set out in more detail elsewhere in this report, it has clearly been a very challenging year for the Group, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the unique challenges presented by COVID-19, and the subsequent capital increase, we have also seen a change in CEO following the decision by Willie Walsh to stand down from the role, along with a number of changes in the membership of the Management Committee level. The Committee recognises the magnitude of these challenges and changes, and the impact that they have had, whether that be on our shareholders, employees, customers, or wider stakeholder base.\n\nAt this time, we face a significant risk in the retention of our Management Committee and other key senior talent and it is important for our business that they are motivated, incentivised and remunerated appropriately to support the return to strong, sustainable business performance. Over the course of 2020, the Committee has sought to make decisions which appropriately balance these\n\nconsiderations. As a result, we were naturally disappointed with the lower than usual vote for our 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration at our delayed 2020 AGM. IAG has always recognised the need to build strong relationships with our investors through a process of open and transparent dialogue, and the Committee has continued that approach during 2020. We have consulted widely with\n\nshareholders over the last six months, both to ensure that we fully understand the reasons for the vote, as well as to get their views and feedback in relation to the next review of our Directors' Remuneration Policy. I discuss both in more detail below, and would like to thank shareholders for their time and constructive feedback.\n\nAt the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting, we were disappointed that a significant minority voted against the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration resolution but were confident that the decisions made with regard to remuneration were in line with our policy and were appropriate under the unique circumstances given the performance of the Company in 2019. Since then, we have engaged with shareholders to more fully understand their concerns and have had a number of productive meetings. The outcomes of these discussions are covered in more detail in the remuneration report.",

        "page_content": "## 2020 Shareholders' Meeting and shareholder consultation\n\nOnce the full impact of the pandemic became clear, particularly from late February 2020 onwards, we acted immediately and took decisive action on executive pay:\n\n- \u00b7 Executive directors and non-executive directors took a 20 per cent reduction in salary or fees from the beginning of April 2020 until the end of the year. Heading into 2021, we are maintaining a reduction of 10%; and\n- \u00b7  Upon recommendation from the Committee, the Board took the decision to cancel the 2020 annual incentive plan.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee was considering 2019 incentive outcomes. As a result of strong financial and operational performance during 2019, the Committee was comfortable that the payments earned by employees, including the Executive Directors, were appropriately aligned with the overall Company circumstances and justifiable. At the time the outcomes were approved, the full impact of COVID-19 was not fully apparent.\n\nBy the time our 2020 Shareholders' Meeting took place in September, the world was fully in the midst of the pandemic. The advisory vote on the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration was passed with 71.6 per cent in favour, a disappointing result given historical levels of support. In engaging with shareholders following the Shareholders' Meeting, some expressed concerns as to whether the 2019 bonus payments were aligned with the overall shareholder and employee experience, given subsequent events in 2020. The Committee listened carefully to all feedback received, both on this issue, as well as wider discussions on our remuneration framework given our Policy was due for renewal. This helped shape the Committee's thinking, and informed internal discussions regarding our Policy review.\n\n## Strategy and link to remuneration\n\nIAG's aim is to become the world's leading airline group. Its strategy is to actively participate in the consolidation of the airline industry to create a multi-brand portfolio of leading airline businesses, each focused on addressing specific customer markets and geographies, while driving revenue and cost synergies through commercial cooperation, scale effects and leverage of the broader Group platform. Execution of this strategy, coupled with disciplined capital allocation, will allow IAG to deliver superior value and sustainable financial returns to its shareholders.\n\nIn reviewing the Directors' Remuneration Policy, the Committee's main objective is to ensure that remuneration at IAG is aligned with, and drives delivery of, our business and strategic priorities, because we see that as the best way to drive short-term and long-term performance. We recognise the need to ensure that there is alignment between performance and pay outcomes, such that the management team receive fair outcomes under our incentive plans only where this can be supported by Company and individual performance and wider stakeholder experience.\n\n## Summary of 2020 performance and incentive outcomes\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, following the report from the Committee, the Board took the decision to cancel the 2020 annual incentive plan in its entirety.\n\nThe 2018 award of the PSP reached the end of its three-year performance period in/uni00A02020. As a result of the pandemic, all three measures (relative TSR, EPS, and RoIC) fell short of the threshold level at which payments begin, resulting in zero vesting overall for executive directors.\n\n## Board changes\n\nLuis Gallego took over from Willie Walsh as IAG CEO in September 2020. The Committee carefully considered the leaving arrangements for Willie and the appointment package for Luis.\n\n## Capital increase\n\nFinally, in October 2020 we carried out a \u20ac2.74 billion capital increase with a view to strengthening our financial position. The Committee considered the effects of this capital increase on the Company's share-based plans and/uni00A0we took action to ensure that participants/uni00A0were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged as a result of the rights/uni00A0issue.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I appreciate your time in reading our 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report, and hope that it will receive your support at our 2021 Shareholders' Meeting. I also hope that our final proposal following the review of our Remuneration Policy will also have your support as shareholders of the Company.\n\nApproved by the Board and signed on its behalf by\n\n## Alberto Terol\n\nRemuneration Committee Chairman",

It was intended that the policy would apply for three years and, therefore, during 2020 the Committee commenced a review of the policy. The proposal for this new remuneration policy will be included as part of the reports that will accompany the notice of the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAs a Spanish incorporated company, IAG is subject to Spanish corporate law. The Spanish legal regime regarding directors' remuneration is substantially parallel to that of the UK as far as directors' remuneration disclosure and approval requirements are concerned.\n\nThe Company welcomes the opportunity provided by the Spanish CNMV allowing companies to prepare free format reports. Therefore, for the third consecutive year, IAG is presenting a consolidated report responding to Spanish and UK disclosure requirements. This report will be accompanied by a duly completed form which is required by the CNMV covering some relevant data. This is prepared in accordance with Spanish legislation and is available on the Company's and the CNMV's respective websites.\n\nIt is the Company's intention once again to comply voluntarily with all reporting aspects of the UK legislation of 2013, The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/860) and The Companies (Directors' Remuneration Policy and Directors' Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019, and to follow best practice UK standards.\n\nIn addition to the Remuneration Committee Chairman's statement, this Directors' Remuneration Report contains the Annual Report on Remuneration, which covers the information on directors' remuneration paid in the reported/uni00A0year.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Key elements of pay\n\n## Executive directors\n\nThe Company's remuneration policy is to provide total remuneration packages which are linked to the business strategy, are competitive, and take into account each individual's performance of their role in the Company's work.\n\nThe Committee is updated on pay and conditions of the employees within the Group, and takes this into account when considering executive directors' remuneration.\n\n## The current and proposed future Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThe current Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved at the Shareholders' Meeting on June 14, 2018. The policy was fully disclosed in the 2017 Directors' Remuneration Report. It is the intention of the Committee that the proposed future policy will reflect a number of changes within the existing regulatory and corporate governance framework. The proposed future remuneration policy will be presented in reports that will accompany the notice of the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting and will be submitted for a shareholder vote at that meeting.",

        "page_content": "## Service contracts and exit payments policy\n\n## Executive directors\n\nThe following is a description of the key terms of the service contracts of executive directors.\n\nThe contracts of executive directors are for an indefinite period.\n\nThere are no express provisions in executives' service contracts with the Company for compensation payable upon termination of those contracts, other than for payments in lieu of notice.\n\n| Executive director   | Date of contract   | Notice period   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Luis Gallego         | September 8, 2020  | 12 months       |\n\nThe period of notice required from the executive is six months; the period of notice required from the Company is 12 months. Where the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice, a lump sum in lieu of the first six months' base salary is payable within 28 days of the date of termination of employment. A payment in respect of base salary for the second six month period only becomes payable if, in the Company's opinion, the executive has taken reasonable steps to find alternative paid work and then only in six monthly instalments. The Company may reduce the sum payable in respect of any month by any amount earned by the executive (including salary and benefits) referable to work done in that month.\n\nIn the event of an executive's redundancy, compensation, whether in respect of a statutory redundancy payment or a payment in lieu of notice or damages for loss of office is capped at an amount equal to 12 months' base salary. The Company will honour the contractual entitlements of a terminated director; however, the Company may terminate an executive's service contract with immediate effect and without compensation on a number of grounds including where the executive is incapacitated for 130 days in any 12 month period, becomes bankrupt, fails to perform his duties to a reasonable standard, acts dishonestly, is guilty of misconduct or persistent breach of his duties, brings the Company into disrepute, is convicted of a criminal offence, is disqualified as a director, refuses to agree to the transfer of his service contract where there is a transfer of the business in which he is working or ceases to be eligible to work in Spain or the UK (as applicable).\n\nUnder the PSP and IADP if a director leaves, the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, may exercise its discretion (within the rules of the two schemes) to grant Good Leaver status. This can be granted in certain circumstances including for example (list not exhaustive) the director leaving for reasons of ill-health, redundancy, retirement or death. Executive directors leaving with Good Leaver status will receive shares awarded to them under the IADP scheme, and a pro-rata amount of their PSP shares subject to the company performance conditions being met. The pro-ration is calculated according to what proportion of the performance period the executive director spent in company service. If Good Leaver status is not granted to an executive director, all outstanding awards made to them under the PSP and IADP will lapse.\n\nIn the event of an executive director's termination from the Company, they must not be employed by, or provide services to, a Restricted Business (i.e. an airline or travel business that competes with the Company) for a period of six months.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nNon-executive directors (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Board regulations and the Company's Bylaws. They do not have the right to any compensation in the event of termination as directors. Board members shall hold office for a period of one year. The dates of the Chairman's and current non-executive directors' appointments are as follows:\n\n| Non-executive director   | Date of the first appointment   | Date of last re-election   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n            | June 20, 2019                   | September 8, 2020          |\n| Alberto Terol            | June 20, 2013                   | September 8, 2020          |\n| Giles Agutter            | September 8, 2020               | -                          |\n| Margaret Ewing           | June 20, 2019                   | September 8, 2020          |\n| Robin Phillips           | September 8, 2020               | -                          |\n| Emilio Saracho           | June 16, 2016                   | September 8, 2020          |\n| Nicola Shaw              | January 1, 2018 1               | September 8, 2020          |\n| Peggy Bruzelius          | December 31, 2020               | -                          |\n| Eva Castillo Sanz        | December 31, 2020               | -                          |\n| Heather Ann McSharry     | December 31, 2020               | -                          |",

All executive directors agreed to a 20 per cent reduction in base salary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Willie Walsh had a reduction in salary from \u00a3850,000 to \u00a3680,000 from April 1, 2020 until his retirement. Steve Gunning had a reduction in salary from \u00a3610,000 to \u00a3488,000 from April 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020. Luis Gallego had a reduction from his salary on appointment of \u00a3820,000 to \u00a3656,000 from his date of appointment to December 31, 2020. These reductions are reflected in the single total figures in the table above.\n\n## Taxable benefits\n\nTaxable benefits including personal travel and, where applicable, a company car, fuel and private health insurance. Luis Gallego also received payments towards relocation costs.\n\n## Pension-related benefits\n\nEmployer's contribution to pension scheme and/or cash in lieu of pension contribution.\n\n## Annual incentive plan\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual incentive plan for the year to December 31, 2020 was cancelled.\n\n## Long-term incentive vesting\n\nThis relates to the IAG PSP 2018 award based on performance measured to December 31, 2020. The outcomes of the performance conditions resulted in zero vesting for executive directors and are described in detail later in this report.\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2020, the \u20ac:\u00a3 exchange rate applied is 1.1273 (2019: 1.1371).\n\n## Share price appreciation and depreciation\n\nThe amount of remuneration attributable to share price appreciation is zero, as there was zero vesting of the IAG PSP 2018 award. The Committee has not exercised any discretion as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation for any of the remuneration in the above table.\n\n## Life Insurance\n\nThe Company provides life insurance for all executive directors. For the year to December 31, 2020 the Company paid contributions of \u20ac15,366 (2019: \u20ac26,790).",

The Company granted an award under the PSP on March 6, 2020. The table in this section sets out the key details of the award.\n\nThe Committee believes that comparing the Company's TSR to that of European transportation companies, including airlines, is appropriate, given that these companies are subject to external influences impacting share price performance similar to those of the Group. As outlined in last year's report, for the first time the index will be the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure Index, as the Board believes this is an appropriate benchmark, particularly as the index includes a large number of other airlines. This comparison provides a good reference point for management outperformance and value creation.\n\nAdjusted EPS reflects the underlying profitability of our business and the core elements of value creation for our shareholders.\n\nThe Company uses rolling RoIC as a profitability indicator to assess efficient return on the Group's asset base. It quantifies how well the airlines generate cash flow in relation to the capital invested in their businesses together with their ability to fund growth and to pay dividends.\n\n## PSP 2020 - eligibility, metrics and targets\n\n| Type of award                                                                                                                  | Shares                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Shares                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Shares                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                | Basis of determination of the size of/uni00A0award Awards only made to those executives who are consistently high-performing, and/or are  in key roles, and/or whom the Company wishes to retain in the long term. | Basis of determination of the size of/uni00A0award Awards only made to those executives who are consistently high-performing, and/or are  in key roles, and/or whom the Company wishes to retain in the long term. | Basis of determination of the size of/uni00A0award Awards only made to those executives who are consistently high-performing, and/or are  in key roles, and/or whom the Company wishes to retain in the long term. |\n| Face value awarded (per cent of salary)                                                                                        | CEO of IAG (Luis Gallego)  -

He received cash in lieu of contributions of \u00a3127,822 (2019: \u00a3212,500).\n\nLuis Gallego is not a member of the Company's pension scheme and the Company, therefore, did not pay any contributions in his time as an executive director during the reporting period (September 8, 2020 to December 31, 2020). He received cash in lieu of contributions of \u00a325,780.\n\nSteve Gunning is not a member of the Company's pension scheme and the Company, therefore, did not pay any contributions during the reporting period (2019: zero). He received cash in lieu of contributions of \u00a364,812 (2019: \u00a339,357).\n\n## Payments for loss of office: Willie Walsh\n\nOn January 9, 2020 it was announced that Willie Walsh had decided to retire as Chief Executive and would step down from the Board on March 26, 2020. Because of the exceptional circumstances that faced the aviation industry due to COVID-19, it was announced on March 16, 2020 that he would delay his retirement for a short period. He stepped down from the Board and retired from the Company on September 8, 2020.\n\nThe details of his leaving arrangements were set out in the 2019 remuneration report and these were unaltered except for his revised leaving date. His outstanding performance share plans (2018 and 2019 awards) were pro-rated to his new leaving date of September 8, 2020, as opposed to the date of June 30, 2020 as stated in the 2019 Remuneration Report. As reported earlier in this report, the 2018 award of the performance share plan resulted in zero vesting.\n\nSince leaving the Company, he has received a payment of \u00a375,192 in lieu of 23 days of accrued but untaken holiday entitlement.\n\nNo other loss of office payments were made during the year in excess of the minimum threshold of \u00a31,000 set for this purpose.\n\n## Payments for loss of office: Enrique Dupuy de L\u00f4me\n\nThe former Chief Financial Officer of IAG, Enrique Dupuy de L\u00f4me (who stood down from the Board on June 20, 2019) has received the following payments during 2020:\n\nBasic salary of \u00a3164,091, taxable benefits of \u00a38,693, and pension benefits of \u00a341,023 (cash allowance). The details for the vesting of his outstanding IADP and PSP awards were set out in the 2019 Remuneration Report and these are unaltered.\n\n## Payments to past directors\n\nBaroness Kingsmill received travel benefits worth \u20ac3,395 during 2020.\n\nJames Lawrence received travel benefits worth \u20ac7,192 during 2020.\n\nDame Marjorie Scardino received travel benefits worth \u20ac13,757 during 2020.\n\nPatrick Cescau received travel benefits worth \u20ac12,114 during 2020.\n\nMarc Bolland received travel benefits worth \u20ac2,129 during 2020 after he had left the Company.\n\nKieran Poynter received travel benefits worth \u20ac4,116 during 2020 after he had left the Company.\n\n## Subject to audit\n\n## Statement of directors' shareholding and share interests\n\nIn order that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, each executive director is required to build up and maintain a minimum personal shareholding in the Company.\n\nUnder the Group's shareholding guidelines, the CEO of IAG is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350 per cent of salary. Other executive directors are required to build up and maintain shareholdings of 200 per cent of salary. In addition, they are required to retain all shares (net of tax) which vest from share plans until their respective shareholding requirement is attained. The Committee has reviewed executive directors' progress against the requirements and notes that both executive directors are above the shareholding requirement.\n\nShares which count towards the guideline include shares already held by the executive, vested and exercised shares, vested and unexercised shares including those in the performance share plan holding period, and unvested deferred annual incentive shares.

Of this a maximum of 5,100,000 shares could be allocated to executive directors under all IAG share plans for awards made during 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n## Company performance graph and CEO of IAG 'single figure' table\n\nThe chart shows the value by December 31, 2020 of a hypothetical \u00a3100 invested in IAG shares on listing compared with the value of \u00a3100 invested in the FTSE 100 index over the same period. A spot share price has been taken on the date of listing, and a three-month average has been taken prior to the year ends.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was selected because it is a broad equity index of which the Company is a constituent, and the index is widely recognised.\n\n## IAG's total shareholder return (TSR) performance compared to the FTSE 100\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table below shows the CEO 'single total figure' of remuneration for each year since the creation of IAG in January 2011:\n\n|      |              | CEO of IAG - 'total single figure'  of remuneration   | Annual incentive payment as a  percentage of the maximum   | Long-term incentive vesting as a percentage of the  maximum   |\n|------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2011 |              | \u00a31,550,000                                            | 18 per cent of maximum                                     | 35 per cent of maximum                                        |\n| 2012 |              | \u00a31,083,000                                            | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n| 2013 |              | \u00a34,971,000                                            | 78.75 per cent of maximum                                  | 100 per cent of maximum                                       |\n| 2014 |              | \u00a36,390,000                                            | 97.78 per cent of maximum                                  | 85 per cent of maximum                                        |\n| 2015 |              | \u00a36,455,000                                            | 80 per cent of maximum                                     | 100 per cent of maximum                                       |\n| 2016 |              | \u00a32,462,000                                            | 33.33 per cent of maximum                                  | 50 per cent of maximum                                        |\n| 2017 |              | \u00a33,954,000                                            | 92.92 per cent of maximum                                  | 66.67 per cent of maximum                                     |\n| 2018 |              | \u00a33,030,000                                            | 61.85 per cent of maximum                                  | 46.19 per cent of maximum                                     |\n| 2019 |              | \u00a33,198,000                                            | 51.97 per cent of maximum                                  | 72.11 per cent of maximum                                     |\n| 2020 | Willie Walsh | \u00a3662,000                                              | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n| 2020 | Luis Gallego | \u00a3301,000                                              | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n\nSingle total figure of remuneration includes basic salary, taxable benefits, pension-related benefits, annual incentive award and longterm incentive vesting and in 2020 reflects the reduction in salary from April 1 to December 31, 2020.\n\n2011 figure includes 20 days of remuneration in January 2011 paid by British Airways.",

It has been determined that the most appropriate group of employees are all UK employees in the Group, which comprised around 39,000 employees at the beginning of 2020 but, following restructurings in the Group as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were around 29,000 employees at the end of 2020. To make the comparison between the CEO of IAG and employees as meaningful as possible, it was determined that as large a group as possible of employees should be chosen.\n\nThe selection of all UK employees in the Group (roughly two-thirds of the entire Group's employees) meets these criteria. The majority of the UK employees in the Group are employed by British Airways, but there are also a number of employees from all other companies in the Group based in the UK. It was determined that employees outside the UK would not be considered for the comparison, as very different employment market conditions exist in other countries.\n\n|                   | CEO of IAG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | UK employees                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basic  salary     | No basic salary increase for 2020 (Willie Walsh).

Since the Shareholders' Meeting, the Company has engaged with major shareholders to understand the main issues causing the low vote in favour, and these were:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual bonus payments for 2019, in light of the Company's current circumstances, in particular the bonus of \u00a3883,000 paid to departing CEO Willie Walsh, given the use of government support and the clear challenges the industry is facing; and\n- \u00b7 the new CFO's remuneration package, which had a higher salary and higher maximum award levels than his predecessor under the annual bonus and the PSP schemes.\n\nThe Company has had a helpful and productive dialogue in our engagement with our main shareholders when discussing these issues. The Committee listened carefully to all feedback received on this, as well as wider discussions on our remuneration framework given our Policy is due for renewal. This will help shape the Committee's thinking and will inform internal discussion and development of the proposed new Remuneration Policy. The Company's response is covered in more detail in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.",

There will be no payment until performance for each particular metric has reached the threshold level of the agreed target range, 50 per cent of the maximum opportunity will be awarded for on-target performance, and the maximum for each element will only be awarded once a stretch target has been reached. Finally, half of the overall outcome of the annual incentive detailed above is payable in deferred shares in the Company vesting after three years (under the Incentive Award Deferral Plan).\n\nFor the long-term incentive, the existing Policy includes a Performance Share Plan (PSP), a discretionary plan targeted at key senior executives and managers of the Group. The PSP consists of an award of the Company's shares which vests subject to the achievement of pre-defined performance conditions designed to reflect the creation of long-term value within the business and which are measured over a three-year performance period. Following the performance period, there is an additional holding period of at least two years.\n\nA full description of the Company's current Remuneration Policy is available on the Company's website.\n\nAs the Company's Remuneration Policy is due to be renewed at the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting, the frameworks for the 2021 annual incentive plan and the 2021 long-term incentive plan will be detailed in the Remuneration Policy proposal, which will be submitted for a shareholder vote at that meeting.\n\n## Taxable benefits and pension-related benefits\n\nTaxable benefits remain unchanged for 2021.\n\n## Non-executive director fees\n\nNon-executive director fees were last reviewed in 2017 and remain unchanged for 2021. The fees have remained unchanged since 2011.\n\nJavier Ferr\u00e1n was appointed Chairman of the Board on January 7, 2021. His fee on appointment was \u20ac645,000 per annum.\n\nAll non-executive directors, including the newly appointed Chairman, have agreed to take a 10 per cent reduction in fees from January 1, 2021 until further notice, as a result of the pandemic.\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is regulated by article 32 of the IAG Board Regulations and by its own Regulations approved on February 25, 2021. A copy of these Regulations is available on the Company's website (www.iairgroup.com).\n\nBeyond executive directors, the Committee oversees the general application of the remuneration policy for the members of the IAG Management Committee (and also occasionally considering remuneration matters related to managers generally across the Group).\n\nAccording to article 32 of the Board Regulations the Remuneration Committee shall be made up of no fewer than three independent non-executive directors, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out their function. Alberto Terol chairs the Committee. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided.\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Code, the Remuneration Committee also has responsibility to review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture.",

The fees paid to Deloitte for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during 2020 were \u20ac117,071, charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to the voluntary UK Code of Conduct. As well as advising the Remuneration Committee, other Deloitte teams provided advice in relation to remuneration, pensions, global employment programmes, data governance, business process improvement, financial advisory work and tax to the Group in 2020. The Committee has reviewed the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent.\n\nThe Company obtained high-level headline remuneration survey data from a variety of sources. During the year, both CEOs of IAG provided regular briefings to the Committee apart from when their own remuneration was being discussed.\n\n## Statement of voting\n\nThe table below shows the consultative vote on the 2019 annual Directors' Remuneration Report at the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting, and the binding vote on the Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2018 Shareholders' Meeting:\n\n|                                | Number of votes cast   | For                              | Against                      | Abstentions/Blank            |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 2019 Annual Directors'         | 871,102,122            | 623,709,500                      | 179,093,920                  | 68,298,702                   |\n| Remuneration Report            |                        | (71.60 per cent)                 | (20.56 per cent)             | (7.84 per cent)              |\n| Directors' Remuneration Policy | 1,463,865,426          | 1,396,029,011   (95.37 per cent) | 13,091,180   (0.89 per cent) | 54,745,235   (3.74 per cent) |\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n## Directors' share options\n\nThe following directors held nil-cost options over ordinary shares of the Company granted under the IAG PSP as at December 31, 2020.\n\nAdjustment\n\n| Director             | Date of grant   | Number of  options at  date of  appointment   | Exercise  price   | Options  exercised  during  the year   | Options  lapsed  during  the year   | Options  granted  during  the year   | as a result  of the  capital  increase   | Exercisable  from   | Number of  options at  December 31,  2020   |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Executive  directors |                 |                                               |                   |                                        |                                     |                                      |                                          |                     |                                             |\n| Luis  Gallego        | May 28, 2015    | 87,031                                        | -

(hereinafter 'International Airlines Group', 'IAG' or the 'Group') is a leading European airline group, formed to hold the interests of airline and ancillary operations. IAG is a Spanish company registered in Madrid and was incorporated on December 17, 2009. On January 21, 2011 British Airways Plc and Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a S.A. Operadora (hereinafter 'British Airways' and 'Iberia' respectively) completed a merger transaction becoming the first two airlines of the Group. Vueling Airlines S.A. ('Vueling') was acquired on April 26, 2013, and Aer Lingus Group Plc ('Aer Lingus') on August 18, 2015. A list of the subsidiaries of the Group is included in the Group investments section.\n\nIAG shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities and also on the stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia (the 'Spanish Stock Exchanges'), through the Spanish Stock Exchanges Interconnection System (Mercado Continuo Espa\u00f1ol).\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (IFRSs as endorsed by the EU). The consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments and other equity investments that are measured at fair value. The carrying value of recognised assets and liabilities that are subject to fair value hedges are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged. The financial statements for the prior year include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nThe Group's financial statements for the year to December 31, 2020 were authorised for issue, and approved by the Board of Directors on February 25, 2021.\n\n## Reclassification\n\nDeferred tax assets arising on the restriction of surpluses to reflect minimum funding requirements of the British Airways Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS) defined benefit schemes, previously recognised within Employee benefit assets in the Balance sheet at December 31, 2019, have been reclassified to be presented net within Deferred tax liabilities at both December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2019 to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification had the effect of reducing Deferred tax liabilities, reducing the Employee benefit assets and increasing the Employee benefit obligations at both balance sheet dates.\n\nThere is no impact to Profit after tax for the year, Other comprehensive income for the year, Net assets or the Statement of changes in equity in any year presented. The following table summarises the impact of the reclassification on the Consolidated balance sheet line items at December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2019:\n\n## Consolidated balance sheet (at December 31, 2019)\n\n| \u20ac million                    | Previously reported   | Reclassification   | Adjusted   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Non-current assets           |                       |                    |            |\n| Employee benefit assets      | 524                   | (210)              | 314        |\n| Non-current liabilities      |                       |                    |            |\n| Employee benefit obligations | 328                   | 72                 | 400        |\n| Deferred tax liability       | 572                   | (282)              | 290        |\n\n## Consolidated balance sheet (at January 1, 2019)\n\n| \u20ac million                    | reported   | Reclassification   | Adjusted   |\n|------------------------------|------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Non-current assets           |            |                    |            |\n| Employee benefit assets      | 1,129      | (365)              | 764        |\n| Deferred tax assets          | 536        | 131                | 667        |\n| Non-current liabilities      |            |                    |            |\n| Employee benefit obligations | 289        | 138                | 427        |\n| Deferred tax liability       | 453        | (372)              | 81         |\n\nPreviously\n\n## Presentation of results\n\nFollowing consideration of regulatory publications, the Group has re-presented its results in the Income statement from using a three-column approach to a single column approach. The comparative figures have also been re-presented. The impact of exceptional items on the performance of the Group is detailed in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fragmented and varied responses from governments have had a significant impact on the Group's results and cash flows. At December 31, 2020, the Group had cash and interest-bearing deposits of \u20ac5.9 billion, \u20ac0.9 billion of committed and undrawn general facilities and a further \u20ac1.2 billion of committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities. Liquidity has been enhanced through to the date of this report by a further \u20ac2.2 billion arising from the Group finalising the terms of a UK Export Credit Facility.\n\nThe reduction in liquidity during 2020 was partially mitigated by, amongst other actions, accessing Spain's Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) facility, the UK's Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF) and Ireland's Strategy Investment Fund (ISIF). These actions raised an additional \u20ac1.4 billion, of which \u20ac0.3 billion matures within 12 months from the date of this report. The Group's\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n144",

This includes the one-year aircraft-backed financing facilities for old and new aircraft which were secured in the second quarter of 2020 and subsequently repaid prior to year-end and the aircraft-specific facility achieved as part of the Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) financing structure. In total the Group raised proceeds of \u20ac2.2 billion through aircraft specific financing.\n\nIn its assessment of going concern over the period to March 31, 2022 (the 'going concern period'), the Group has modelled two scenarios referred to below as the Base Case and the Downside Case. The Group's three-year Business plan, prepared and approved by the Board in December 2020, was subsequently refreshed with the latest available internal and external information in February 2021. This refreshed Business plan supports the Base Case, which takes into account the Board's and management's views on the anticipated impact and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group across the going concern period. The key inputs and assumptions underlying the Base Case include:\n\n- \u00b7 As part of the recovery, the Group has assumed a gradual easing of travel restrictions, by geographical region, based on deployment of vaccines during the year. Travel corridors between countries are assumed to be introduced from quarter 3 2021, first in Europe then North America, with other regions following in the first half of 2022;\n- \u00b7 Capacity recovery modelled by geographical region (and in certain regions, by key destinations) with capacity gradually increasing from a reduction of 79 per cent in quarter 1 2021 (compared to the equivalent period in 2019) to 18 per cent in quarter 1 2022 (again compared to quarter 1 2019), with the average over the going concern period being 43 per cent down;\n- \u00b7 Passenger unit revenue per ASK, although forecast to continue recovering, is expected to still remain below levels of 2019 by the end of the going concern period, which is based on, amongst other assumptions, a greater weighting of shorthaul versus longhaul, leisure versus business and economy versus premium compared to 2019. Specifically, the Group's expectation is that traffic related to domestic and leisure will recover faster than longhaul and business;\n- \u00b7 The Group has assumed that the committed and undrawn general facilities of \u20ac0.9 billion will not be drawn over the going concern period. The availability of certain of these facilities reduces over time, with \u20ac0.1 billion being available to the Group at the end of the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 The Group has assumed that of the committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities of \u20ac1.2 billion, \u20ac0.4 billion will be drawn to fund specific aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2021 and of the remaining \u20ac0.8 billion, \u20ac0.3 billion would be available to be drawn over the going concern period if required; and\n- \u00b7 Of the capital commitments detailed in note 14, \u20ac1.6 billion is due to be paid over the going concern period and the Group has forecast securing 80 per cent, or \u20ac1.0 billion, of the aircraft financing required that is currently uncommitted, to align with the timing and payments for these aircraft deliveries. This loan to value assumption is below the level of financing the Group has been able to achieve recently, including over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to date.\n\nThe Downside Case applies further stress to the Base Case to model a more prolonged downturn, with a more gradual recovery relative to the Base Case. The Downside Case is representative of a slower roll out of the vaccination programme on a regional basis, with travel restrictions remaining in place and the gradual recovery of capacity being delayed longer than in the Base Case. The Downside Case also models a more acute impact on the longhaul sector, with the domestic sector and European shorthaul sectors recovering faster than longhaul. The result of which is that the levels of capacity assumed under the Base Case for the third quarter of 2021 are not achieved under the Downside Case until the first quarter of 2022. In the Downside Case, over the going concern period capacity would be 60 per cent down on 2019. The Directors consider the Downside Case to be a severe but plausible scenario.\n\nThe Group has modelled the impact of further deteriorations in capacity operated and yield, including mitigating actions to reduce operating and capital expenditure. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions, including asset disposals, it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.\n\nFurthermore, to add resilience to the liquidity position of the Group, the Directors are actively pursuing a range of financing options, including the renegotiation of existing financing arrangements and securing additional long term financial facilities, but these have not been included in the Base or Downside Cases.\n\nHaving reviewed the Base Case, Downside Case and additional sensitivities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nHowever, due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, there are a number of significant factors that are outside of the control of the Group, including: the status and impact of the pandemic worldwide; the emergence of new variants of the virus and potential resurgence of existing strains of the virus; the availability of vaccines worldwide, together with the speed at which they are deployed; the efficacy of those vaccines; and the restrictions imposed by national governments in respect of the freedom of movement and travel. The Group, therefore, is not able to provide certainty that there could not be a more severe downside scenario than those it has considered, including the sensitivities in relation to the timing of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, capacity operated, impact on yield, cost mitigations achieved and the availability of aircraft financing to offset capital expenditure. In the event that a more severe scenario were to occur, the Group will need to secure sufficient additional funding. As set out above, sources of additional funding are expected to include the renegotiation of existing financing arrangements and securing additional long term financial facilities. However, the Group's ability to obtain this additional funding in the event of a more severe downside scenario represents a material uncertainty at February 25, 2021 that could cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n145\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

        "page_content": "## 2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each made up to December 31, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associates and joint ventures, adjusted where appropriate to conform to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration paid is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented separately within equity in the consolidated Balance sheet. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the Income statement.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nAll intragroup account balances, including intragroup profits, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and leaseback transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. In certain instances the Group will finance several such transactions at once through Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). Under each of these financing structures, a company (the EETC Issuer) is established to facilitate such financing on behalf of a number of unrelated investors. The proceeds from the issuance of the EETCs by the EETC Issuer are then used to purchase aircraft solely from the Group. Payments by the Group (under the asset financed liabilities) to the EETC Issuer are distributed, through a trust, to the aforementioned unrelated investors. The main purpose of the trust structure is to enhance the credit worthiness of the Group's debt obligations through certain bankruptcy protection provisions and liquidity facilities, and also to lower the Group's total borrowing cost.\n\nThe EETC Issuer is established solely with the purpose of providing the asset-backed financing and upon maturity of such financing is expected to have no further activity. The relevant activities of the EETC Issuer are restricted to pre-established financing agreements and the retention of the title of the associated financed aircraft. Accordingly, the Group has determined that each EETC Issuer is a structured entity. Under the contractual terms of the EETC structure, the Group does not own any of the share capital of the EETC Issuer, does not have any representation on the respective boards and has no ability to influence decision making.\n\nIn considering the aforementioned facts, management has concluded that the Group does not have access to variable returns from the EETC Issuers because its involvement is limited to the payment of principal and interest under the arrangement and, therefore, it does not control the EETC Issuers and as such does not consolidate them.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with how resource allocation decisions are made by the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the IAG Management Committee.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\n## a Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In particular, British Airways and Avios have a functional currency of pound sterling. The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\n## b Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency using the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency balances are translated into the functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at balance sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities classified as non-current on the Balance sheet are recognised within Net currency retranslation (charges)/credits in the Income statement. All other gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in operating profit.\n\n## c Group companies\n\nThe net assets of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses of such operations are translated into euros at average rates of exchange during the year. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity (Currency translation reserve) until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the Income statement.\n\n146",

        "page_content": "## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is held at cost. The Group has a policy of not revaluing property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value on a straight-line basis, over the economic life of the asset. Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market values for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.\n\n## a Capitalisation of interest on progress payments\n\nInterest attributed to progress payments made on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income statement in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## b Fleet\n\nAll aircraft are stated at the fair value of the consideration given after taking account of manufacturers' credits. Fleet assets owned or right of use ('ROU') assets are disaggregated into separate components and depreciated at rates calculated to write down the cost of each component to the estimated residual value at the end of their planned operational lives (which is the shorter of their useful life or lease term) on a straight-line basis. Depreciation rates are specific to aircraft type, based on the Group's fleet plans, within overall parameters of 23 years and up to 5 per cent residual value for shorthaul aircraft and between 25 and 29 years (depending on aircraft) and up to 5 per cent residual value for longhaul aircraft. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the aforementioned depreciation rates.\n\nCabin interior modifications, including those required for brand changes and relaunches, are depreciated over the lower of five years and the remaining economic life of the aircraft.\n\nAircraft and engine spares acquired on the introduction or expansion of a fleet, as well as rotable spares purchased separately, are carried as property, plant and equipment and generally depreciated in line with the fleet to which they relate.\n\nMajor overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs, is capitalised and amortised over the average expected life between major overhauls. All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 'pay-as-you-go' contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.\n\n## c Other property, plant and equipment\n\nProvision is made for the depreciation of all property, plant and equipment. Property, with the exception of freehold land, is depreciated over its expected useful life over periods not exceeding 50 years, or in the case of leasehold properties, over the duration of the lease if shorter, on a straight-line basis. Equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from 4 to 20 years.\n\n## d Leases\n\nThe Group leases various aircraft, properties and equipment. The lease terms of these assets are consistent with the determined useful economic life of similar assets within property, plant and equipment.\n\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nLeases are recognised as a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nAt the lease commencement date a ROU asset is measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; any initial direct costs; and restoration costs to return the asset to its original condition. (with a corresponding amount recognised within Provisions).\n\nThe ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If ownership of the ROU asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at their present value, which includes the following lease payments: fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option; and payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is the discount rate that, at the inception of the lease, causes the aggregate present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value to be equal to the fair value of the leased asset and any initial indirect costs of the lessor. For aircraft leases these inputs are either observable in the contract or readily available from external market data. The initial direct costs of the lessor are considered to be immaterial. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the Group entity's incremental borrowing rate is used.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability for each period. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\n147\n\nFinancial Statements",

        "page_content": "## 2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\nThe carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the lease contract, a re-assessment of the lease term (specifically in regard to assumptions regarding extension and termination options) and changes in variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate.\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and those leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight line basis as an expense in the Income statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, that do not contain a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the ROU asset. Extension options are included in a number of aircraft, property and equipment leases across the Group and are reflected in the lease payments where the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. The Group is also exposed to variable lease payments based on usage or revenue generated over a defined period. Such variable lease payments are expensed to the Income statement as incurred.\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and lease transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each transaction is assessed as to whether it meets the criteria within IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' for a sale to have occurred. If a sale has occurred, then the associated asset is de-recognised and a ROU asset and lease liability is recognised. The ROU asset recognised is based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that is retained. Any gain or loss is restricted to the amount that relates to the rights that have been transferred to the counter-party to the transaction. Where a sale has not occurred, the asset is retained on the balance sheet within Property, plant and equipment and an asset financed liability recognised equal to the financing proceeds.\n\nFinancing arrangements with the following features that do not meet the recognition criteria as a sale under IFRS 15 are therefore not eligible for recognition under IFRS 16: the lessor has legal ownership retention as security against repayment and interest obligations; the Group initially acquired the aircraft or took a major share in the acquisition process from the manufacturer; in view of the contractual conditions, it is virtually certain that the aircraft will be purchased at the end of the lease term.\n\n## Cash flow presentation\n\nLease payments are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement: the repayments of the principal element of lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities; the payments of the interest element of lease liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities, and; the payments arising from variable elements of a lease, short-term leases and low-value assets are presented within cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## COVID-19 related rent concessions\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued 'COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions - amendments to IFRS 16 Leases'. The EU subsequently adopted the amendment on October 9, 2020. The amendment provides a practical expedient for lessees not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession is a lease modification. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after June 1, 2020 and the Group has elected to adopt this amendment for the year to December 31, 2020.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## a Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Where the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree is in excess of the consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the Income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment, goodwill is grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## b Brands\n\nBrands arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Long established brands that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## c Customer loyalty programmes\n\nCustomer loyalty programmes arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. A customer loyalty programme with an expected useful life is amortised over the expected remaining useful life. Established customer loyalty programmes that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## d Landing rights\n\nLanding rights acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Landing rights acquired from other airlines are capitalised at cost.\n\nCapitalised landing rights based outside of the United Kingdom and the EU are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years. Capitalised landing rights based within the EU are not amortised, as regulations provide that these landing rights are perpetual.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n148",

Emissions allowances are not revalued or amortised but are tested for impairment whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nFrom time to time the Group enters into sale and repurchase transactions for specified emission allowances. Such transactions do not meet the recognition criteria of a sale under IFRS 15 and accordingly the asset is retained on the balance sheet within Intangible assets and an other financing liability recognised equal to the proceeds received.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the value by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that were subject to an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## a Property, plant and equipment, including Right of use assets\n\nThe carrying value is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and the cumulative impairment losses are shown as a reduction in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## b Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are held at cost and are either amortised on a straight-line basis over their economic life, or they are deemed to have an indefinite economic life and are not amortised. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence. Where the Group cannot exercise control over an entity in which it has a shareholding greater than 51 per cent, the equity interest is treated as an associated undertaking.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, and initially recognised at cost. The Group's interest in the net assets of associates and joint ventures is included in Investments accounted for using the equity method in the Balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the Income statement, below operating result. The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## a Other equity investments\n\nOther equity investments are non-derivative financial assets including listed and unlisted investments, excluding interests in associates and joint ventures. On initial recognition, these equity investments are irrevocably designated as measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income. They are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Other comprehensive income with no recycling of these gains and losses to the Income statement when the investment is sold. Dividends received on other equity investments are recognised in the Income statement.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.\n\n## b Interest-bearing deposits\n\nInterest-bearing deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, and held in order to collect contractual cash flows, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n149\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

        "page_content": "## 2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## c Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swap agreements, foreign exchange derivatives and fuel hedging derivatives (including options, swaps and futures) are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. They are classified as financial instruments through the Income statement. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss arising from remeasurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged (as detailed below under cash flow hedges). The time value of options is excluded from the designated hedging instrument and accounted for as a cost of hedging. Movements in the time value of options are recognised in Other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and that instrument expires, is sold or is restructured, any cumulative gain or loss remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the hedging instrument was due to mature at inception of the relationship. Where a forecast transaction which was previously determined to be highly probable and hedge accounting applied, is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve is immediately reclassified to the Income statement.\n\nExchange gains and losses on monetary investments are taken to the Income statement unless the item has been designated and is assessed as an effective hedging instrument. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary investments are reflected in equity.\n\n## d Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as a hedge of a highly probable expected future cash flow and assessed as effective are recorded in equity. Gains and losses on derivative instruments not designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in the Income statement. Gains and losses recorded in equity are reflected in the Income statement when either the hedged cash flow impacts the Income statement or the hedged item is no longer expected to occur.\n\nCertain loan repayment instalments denominated in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan are designated as cash flow hedges of highly probable future foreign currency revenues. Exchange differences arising from the translation of these loan repayment instalments are recorded in equity and subsequently reflected in the Income statement when either the future revenue impacts income or its occurrence is no longer expected to occur.\n\n## e Long-term borrowings\n\nLong-term borrowings are recorded at amortised cost, including lease liabilities which contain interest rate swaps that are closely related to the underlying financing and as such are not accounted for as an embedded derivative.\n\n## f Convertible debt\n\nConvertible bonds are classified as compound instruments, consisting of a liability and an equity component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt, and is subsequently recorded at an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds, and is recognised within Interest-bearing borrowings. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in Equity portion of convertible bond in Other reserves and is not subsequently remeasured.\n\nIssue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds where appropriate based on their relative carrying values at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.\n\nThe interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this value and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability.\n\n## g Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group recognises provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost, based on 12-month or lifetime losses depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The simplified approach, based on the calculation and recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, is applied to contracts that have a maturity of one year or less, including trade receivables.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and when estimating the expected credit loss, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment, including forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information takes into consideration the forecast economic conditions expected to impact the outstanding balances at the balance sheet date. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as the customer having filed for liquidation.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n150",

        "page_content": "## Employee benefit plans\n\n## a Pension obligations\n\nThe Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior years.\n\nTypically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-rated corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the net obligation calculation results in an asset for the Group, the recognition of an asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan ('the asset ceiling'). The fair value of the plan assets is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The fair value of insurance policies which exactly match the amount and timing of some or all benefits payable under the scheme are deemed to be the present value of the related obligations. Longevity swaps are measured at their fair value.\n\nCurrent service costs are recognised within employee costs in the year in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised in the event of a plan amendment or curtailment, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or severance obligations. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest and other expenses related to the defined benefit plans are recognised in the Income statement. Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding interest) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the Income statement in subsequent periods.\n\n## b Severance obligations\n\nSeverance obligations are recognised when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises a provision for severance payments when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal, or providing severance payments as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nOther employee benefits are recognised when there is deemed to be a present obligation.\n\n## Taxation\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nIncome tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Income statement.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Such cost is determined by the weighted average cost method. Inventories include mainly aircraft spare parts, repairable aircraft engine parts and fuel.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits with any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand or maturing within three months of the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n151\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

        "page_content": "## 2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based payment plans, under which the Group awards equity instruments of the Group for services rendered by employees. The fair value of the share-based payment plans is measured at the date of grant using a valuation model provided by external specialists. The resulting cost, as adjusted for the expected and actual level of vesting of the plan, is charged to the Income statement over the period in which the options vest. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, and accordingly the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income statement with a corresponding entry in equity.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made when an obligation exists for a present liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.\n\nEmployee leaving indemnities and other employee provisions are recorded for flight crew who, meeting certain conditions, have the option of being placed on reserve or of taking early retirement. The Group is obligated to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The calculation is performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.\n\nOther employee related provisions are recognised for direct expenditures of business reorganisation such as severance payments (restructuring provisions) where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.\n\nRestoration and handback provisions arising on the commencement of a lease are recognised as a provision with a corresponding amount recognised as part of the ROU asset. Any change in estimation relating to such costs are reflected in the ROU asset. Maintenance and handback provisions that occur through usage or through the passage of time are recognised with a corresponding amount recorded over time in the Income statement.\n\nIf the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the provision. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nThe Group's revenue primarily derives from transportation services for both passengers and cargo. Revenue is recognised when the transportation service has been provided. Passenger tickets are generally paid for in advance of transportation and are recognised, net of discounts, as deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until the customer has flown. Prior to the impact of COVID19 on the ability of passengers to utilise the Group's transportation services, unused tickets were recognised as revenue after the contracted date of departure using estimates regarding the timing of recognition based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and statistical analysis of historical trends. If as a result of the impact of COVID-19 a flight is cancelled, the passenger is entitled to either a refund, changing to an alternative flight or the receipt of a voucher. Where a voucher is issued, given the relative short period of historical data, no revenue is recognised until either the voucher is redeemed through transportation services or it expires. Revenue is stated net of compensation for flight delays and cancellations, taking into consideration the level of expected claims.\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to transportation services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. The Group acts as an agent where (i) it collects various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to passengers and remits these to the relevant taxing authorities; and (ii) where it provides interline services to airline partners outside of the Group.\n\nOther revenue including maintenance; handling; hotel and holiday and commissions is recognised as the related performance obligations are satisfied (over time), being where the control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer.\n\n## Customer loyalty programmes\n\nThe Group operates four loyalty programmes: the British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Vueling Club and the Aer Lingus Aer Club. The customer loyalty programmes award travellers Avios to redeem for various rewards, primarily redemption travel, including flights, hotels and car hire. Avios are also sold to commercial partners to use in loyalty activity.\n\nThe Group has identified several performance obligations associated with the sale of Avios. Revenue associated with brand and marketing services and revenue associated with Avios has been determined based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each of the performance obligations. Revenue associated with brand and marketing services is recognised as the points are issued. Revenue allocated to the Avios is deferred on the balance sheet as a current liability, and recognised when the points are redeemed. When the points are redeemed for products provided by suppliers outside the Group, revenue is recognised in the Income statement net of related costs, as the Group is considered to be an agent in these redemption transactions.\n\nThe Group estimates the stand-alone selling price of the brand and marketing performance obligations by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay in an arm's length transaction for access to comparable brands for the period over which they have access. The stand-alone selling price of Avios is based on the value of the awards for which the points could be redeemed. The Group also recognises revenue associated with the proportion of Avios which are not expected to be redeemed, based on the results of statistical modelling.\n\n152",

        "page_content": "## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or nature and where such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity's financial performance. The exceptional items recorded in the Income statement include items such as significant settlement agreements with the Group's pension schemes; significant restructuring; the impact of business combination transactions that do not contribute to the ongoing results of the Group; significant discontinuance of hedge accounting; legal settlements; and the impact of the sale, disposal or impairment of an asset or investment in a business.\n\nBusiness combination transactions include cash items such as the costs incurred to effect the transaction and non-cash items such as accounting gains or losses recognised through the Income statement, such as bargain purchase gains and step acquisition losses.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. Loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent market rates of interest are recorded at the amount of the proceeds received and recognised within Borrowings. Those loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent below market rates of interest are measured at inception at their fair value and recognised within Borrowings, with the differential to the proceeds received recorded within Deferred income and released to the relevant financial statement caption in the Income statement on a systematic basis. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the Income statement in the relevant financial statement caption on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results in the future may differ from judgements and estimates upon which financial information has been prepared. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\n\n## a Employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities, other employee related restructuring\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group recognised \u20ac282 million in respect of employee benefit assets (2019: \u20ac314 million) and \u20ac719 million in respect of employee benefit obligations (2019: \u20ac400 million). Further information on employee benefit obligations is disclosed in note 30.\n\nThe cost of employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities and other employee related provisions is determined using actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such assumptions are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions relating to these schemes are disclosed in note 30. The Group determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with qualified actuaries. Any difference between these assumptions and the actual outcome will impact future net assets and total comprehensive income. The sensitivity to changes in pension assumptions is disclosed in note 30.\n\nUnder the Group's APS and NAPS defined benefit schemes, increases to pensions are based on the annual Government Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Additionally, in APS there is provision for the Trustee to pay increases up to the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI), subject to certain affordability tests. Historically market expectations for RPI could be derived by comparing the prices of UK Government fixed-interest and index-linked gilts, with CPI assessed by considering the Bank of England's inflation target and comparison of the construction of the two inflation indices.\n\nIn February 2019, following the UK House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee report on measuring inflation, the National Statistician concluded that the existing methodology was unsatisfactory and proposed a number of options to the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA). In March 2019, the UKSA recommended to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer that the publication of the RPI cease at a point to be determined in the future and in the intervening period, the RPI be addressed by bringing in the methods of the CPIH (a proposed variant to CPI). In September 2019, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced his intention to consult with the Bank of England and the UKSA on whether to implement these proposed changes to RPI in the period of 2025 to 2030. Following consultation during 2020, on November 25, 2020 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer and the UKSA confirmed that from February 2030 onwards CPIH will replace RPI with no compensation to holders of index-linked gilts.\n\nFollowing the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement in September 2019 and through to December 31, 2020, market-implied break-even RPI inflation forward rates for periods after 2030 have reduced in the investment market. Therefore, in assessing RPI and CPI from investment market data, allowance has been made for partial alignment between RPI and CPI from 2030 onwards.\n\n153\n\nFinancial Statements",

        "page_content": "## 2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\nOn October 26, 2018 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales issued a judgment in a claim between Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees Limited as claimant and Lloyds Banking Group plc and others as defendants (collectively referred to as the 'Lloyds Bank case') regarding the rights of female members of certain pension schemes to equality of treatment in relation to pension benefits. The judgment in the Lloyd's Bank case confirmed that all pension schemes were required to equalise, with immediate application, for the effects of unequal Guaranteed Minimum Pension ('GMP') benefits accrued over the period since May 17, 1990 ('GMP equalisation'). On November 20, 2020 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales issued a further judgment requiring all pension schemes, if requested by their individual members, to revisit individual transfer payments made between May 17, 1990 and April 5, 1997 to assess the shortfall, if any, between the original transfer payments and the impact of GMP equalisation. Where a shortfall exists, the pension scheme is required to make an additional payment to the individual member, including interest accrued at 1.0 per cent above the base rate per annum. The APS and NAPS estimated Defined benefit obligations as at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 includes allowance for the estimated effect of GMP equalisation based on the assessments made by the respective APS and NAPS Scheme Actuaries.\n\nRestructuring provisions are estimates of future obligations. The Group exercises judgement in determining the expected direct expenditures of reorganisation based on plans which are sufficiently detailed and advanced.\n\n## b Revenue recognition\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group recognised \u20ac5,130 million (2019: \u20ac5,486 million) in respect of deferred revenue on ticket sales of which \u20ac2,725 million (2019: \u20ac1,917 million) related to customer loyalty programmes.\n\nPassenger revenue is recognised when the transportation is provided. At the time of transportation, revenue is also recognised in respect of tickets that are not expected to be used ('unused tickets'). Revenue associated with unused tickets is estimated based on the terms and conditions of the tickets and historical trends.\n\nRevenue associated with the issuance of points under customer loyalty programmes is based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of the related performance obligations (brand, marketing and points), determined using estimation techniques. The transaction price of brand and marketing services is determined using specific brand valuation methodologies. The transaction price of the points is based on the value of the awards for which the points can be redeemed and is reduced to take account of the proportion of the award credits that are not expected to be redeemed by customers. The Group estimates the number of points not expected to be redeemed (using statistical modelling and historical trends) and the mix and fair value of the award credits. A five percentage point change in the assumption of points outstanding and not expected to be redeemed would result in an adjustment to deferred revenue of \u20ac100 million, with an offsetting adjustment to revenue and operating profit recognised in the year.\n\nIn August 2020, the Group received an upfront payment of \u20ac830 million (\u00a3754 million) related to the fulfilment of future performance obligations under the renewal of the multi-year commercial partnership with American Express. The Group estimates the number of points expected to issued over the life of the contract and allocates the upfront payment to the relevant performance obligations. At each reporting date, the Group updates its estimate of the number of points expected to be issued over the total contract term and recognises a cumulative catch-up adjustment where necessary. The Group considers that these upfront payments include a significant financing component considering the length of time between the payment and the expected allocation to performance obligations. Accordingly, the transaction price for the contract is discounted using the prevailing market interest rate.\n\nThe following three accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or are areas where assumptions are significant to the financial statements however these accounting estimates are not major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year.\n\n## c Income taxes\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group recognised \u20ac1,075 million in respect of deferred tax assets (2019: \u20ac546 million). Further information on current and deferred tax liabilities is disclosed in note 9.\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Estimates are required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance. Where the Group determines that it is more likely than not that the tax authorities would accept the position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the financial statements on that basis. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group recognises a liability based on either: the Group's judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, uses a probability weighted average approach.\n\nThe Group recognises deferred income tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Management considers past and current operating performance and the future projections of performance laid out in the approved business plan in order to assess the probability of recoverability. The Business plan relies on the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements in respect of future performance and economics.\n\n154",

        "page_content": "## d Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group recognised \u20ac2,390 million (2019: \u20ac2,460 million) in respect of intangible assets with an indefinite life, including goodwill. Further information on these assets is included in note 15.\n\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite economic lives are tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which use a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model. The Group has applied judgement in the weighting of each scenario in the discounted cash flow model and these calculations require the use of estimates in the determination of key assumptions and sensitivities as disclosed in note 15.\n\nOther non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\n## e Residual values and useful lives of assets\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group recognised \u20ac17,531 million (2019: \u20ac19,168 million) in respect of property, plant and equipment, including the ROU assets recognised in the year. Further information on these assets is included in note 12 and note 13.\n\nThe Group estimates useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment, including fleet assets based on network plans and recoverable values. Useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually, taking into consideration the latest fleet plans and other business plan information.\n\n## Judgements\n\n## a Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Group recognised \u20ac1,588 million in respect of maintenance, restoration and handback provisions (2019: \u20ac1,675 million). Information on movements on the provision is disclosed in note 24.\n\nThe Group has a number of contracts with service providers to replace or repair engine parts and for other maintenance checks. These agreements are complex and generally cover a number of years. The Group exercises judgement in determining the assumptions used to match the consumption of replacement spares and other costs associated with fleet maintenance with the appropriate income statement charge. Aircraft maintenance obligations are based on aircraft utilisation, expected maintenance intervals, future maintenance costs and the aircraft's condition.\n\n## b Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. Such judgement includes consideration of fleet plans which underpin approved business plans and historical experience regarding the extension of leases. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances and affects the Group's ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. Further information is given in note 13.\n\n## New standards, amendments and interpretations\n\nThe following amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020, but do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions - amendments to IFRS 16 Leases;\n- \u00b7 Amendments to references to the conceptual framework in IFRS standards;\n- \u00b7 Definition of a business (amendments to IFRS 3 'Business combinations');\n- \u00b7 Definition of material (amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements' and IAS 8 'Accounting policies, Changes in accounting estimates and errors'); and\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial instruments', IAS 39 'Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement' and IFRS 7 'Financial instruments: Disclosures', which conclude on phase one of the IASB's work to respond to the effects of Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) reform on financial reporting. The amendments provide temporary reliefs which enable hedge accounting to continue during the period of uncertainty before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate.\n\nThe IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations with an effective date after the year end of these financial statements which management believe could impact the Group in future periods. Unless otherwise stated, the Group plans to adopt the following standards, interpretations and amendments on the date they become mandatory:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021;\n- \u00b7 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use - Amendments to IAS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IFRS 3 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022; and\n- \u00b7 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current Amendments to IAS 1 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n155\n\nFinancial Statements",

Accordingly, the Group has applied critical estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 regarding the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities within the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - cash flow forecast estimation\n\nThe Group has applied estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on the estimation uncertainty of determining cash flow forecasts as part of the approved Business plans. The details regarding the inputs and assumptions used in the determination of these cash flow forecasts are given in the going concern basis of preparation.\n\nThe following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements utilise these cash flow forecasts consistently, which are in some instances significantly different from judgements applied in previous years:\n\n## a Discontinuance of hedge accounting\n\nIn determining whether hedge accounting is required to be discontinued or to remain in a hedge relationship, judgement is required as to whether a forecast transaction that was previously highly probable continues to be expected to occur or is no longer expected to occur. The Group applied the capacity output from the cash flow forecasts as part of the approved Business plans in order to determine the forecast level of revenue generation and fuel consumption over the periods in which hedge accounting has been applied.\n\nIn 2020 the Group recognised a charge arising from such discontinuance of \u20ac1,756 million represented by an expense of \u20ac62 million relating to revenue foreign currency derivatives, an expense of \u20ac1,781 million relating to fuel derivatives and a credit of \u20ac87 million related to the associated fuel foreign currency derivatives. These amounts relate to the discontinuance of hedge accounting of the associated foreign currency and fuel derivatives on forecast revenue and fuel consumption. These losses have arisen from the substantial deterioration in demand for air travel caused by COVID-19, which has caused a significant level of hedged passenger revenue transactions and fuel purchases in US dollars to no longer be expected to occur based on the Group's operating forecasts prevailing at the Balance sheet date. The Group's risk management strategy has been to build up these hedges gradually over a three-year period when the level of forecast passenger revenue and fuel consumption were higher than current expectations. Accordingly, the hedge accounting for these transactions has been discontinued and the losses recognised in the Income statement. The exceptional charge relating to revenue derivatives and fuel derivatives has been recorded in the Income statement within Passenger revenue and Fuel, oil and emission charges, respectively.\n\n## b Long-term fleet plans and associated impairment\n\nThe Group derives long-term fleet plans from the cash flow forecasts arising from the approved business plans. In deriving the long-term fleet plans, the Group applies judgement with respect to consideration of the period of temporary and permanent grounding of fleet assets, the deferral of the delivery of certain aircraft and the assumptions around specific provisions relating to leased fleet assets.\n\nIn 2020 the Group recognised an impairment charge of \u20ac856 million, represented by an impairment of fleet assets of \u20ac837 million and an impairment of other assets of \u20ac19 million. The fleet impairment relates to 82 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories that have been stood down permanently and 2 further aircraft which have been impaired down to their recoverable value at December 31, 2020, which includes 32 Boeing 747 aircraft, 23 Airbus A320 aircraft, 15 Airbus A340 aircraft, 4 Airbus A330200 aircraft, 2 Airbus A318 aircraft, 1 Airbus A321 aircraft, 1 Airbus A319 aircraft, 2 Boeing 777-200 aircraft and 4 Embraer E170 aircraft. Of the fleet impairment, \u20ac676 million is recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac161 million is recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft.\n\nFurther, the Group has recognised additional inventory write downs of \u20ac71 million and additional specific provisions relating to leased fleet assets of \u20ac37 million. The inventory write down expense represents those expendable inventories that, given the asset impairments, are no longer expected to be utilised. The charge relating to the recognition of contractual lease provisions represents the estimation of the additional cost to fulfil the hand back conditions associated with the leased aircraft that have been permanently stood down and impaired.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section, note 12, note 13 and note 24.\n\n## c Impairment testing of the Group's cash generating units\n\nDue to the estimation uncertainty of the timing and duration of the recovery from COVID-19, the Group has adopted a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model derived from the cash flow forecasts from the approved business plans. The Group exercises judgement in determining the weighting between these scenarios in the value-in-use model.\n\nHaving undertaken this impairment testing, the Group has not recognised any impairment charge. While no impairment charge is arising, the headroom in the impairment test of the British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus cash generating units are particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Further information is given in note 15.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n156",

Given the estimation uncertainty of the timing and duration of the recovery from COVID-19, the Group exercises judgement in the determination of cash flows during this recovery and subsequent periods.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of \u20ac1,337 million relating to tax losses the Group does not reasonably expect to utilise. Further information is given in note 9.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - other transactions\n\nIn addition to the estimation uncertainty relating to cash flow forecasts, the Group has applied the following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements that impact the consolidated financial statements:\n\n## e Revenue recognition\n\nHistorically, where a voucher has been issued to a customer in the event of a flight cancellation, the Group estimated, based on historical evidence, the level of such vouchers that would not be used prior to expiry and recognised revenue accordingly. Due to the significant level of flight cancellations arising from COVID-19 there remains insufficient historical data by which to reliably estimate the amount of these vouchers that will not be used prior to expiry. Accordingly, the Group has not recognised revenue arising from those vouchers issued due to COVID-19 related cancellations until either the voucher is redeemed or it expires.\n\n## Significant transactions as a result of COVID-19\n\nThe Group has recorded the following additional significant transactions as a result of management actions in response to COVID-19:\n\n## f Restructuring costs\n\nAs a result of the structural changes to the airline sector, the Group has undertaken significant restructuring activities during 2020 to align the size of the workforce with the expected level of capacity. This has led to the recognition of severance pay of \u20ac313 million arising in British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia, and LEVEL and relating to a forecast reduction of employee numbers of approximately 10,500 as at December 31, 2020. This amount excludes those payments associated with restructuring programmes that were approved prior to COVID-19. These restructuring costs have been recorded as a charge to Employee costs. Further information is given in note 24 and the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## g Rights issue\n\nTo enhance the liquidity of the Group as a direct result of the impact of COVID-19, on October 2, 2020, the Group raised \u20ac2,741 million through a rights issue of 2,979,443 thousand new ordinary shares at a price of 92 \u20ac cents per share on the basis of 3 shares for every 2 existing shares. The transaction resulted in an increase of Share capital of \u20ac298 million and an increase in Share premium of \u20ac2,443 million. Further information is given in note 27.\n\n## h Loans and borrowings\n\nTo enhance liquidity due to the impact of COVID-19, the Group has entered into a number of financing arrangements during 2020, which have been fully drawn unless otherwise stated, including:\n\n- \u00b7 On March 30, 2020, British Airways extended its US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility for one year from June 23, 2020 to June 23, 2021. The amount available under the extended facility was \u20ac1.18 billion ($1.38 billion) at the time of exercising the extension and as at December 31, 2020 \u20ac0.64 billion ($0.79 billion) was available to be drawn;\n- \u00b7 On April 12, 2020, British Airways availed itself of the Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility, issuing commercial paper to the Government of the United Kingdom of \u20ac328 million (\u00a3298 million) and repayable in April 2021;\n- \u00b7 On May 1, 2020, Iberia and Vueling entered into floating rate syndicated financing agreements backed by Spain's ICO for \u20ac750 million and \u20ac260 million, respectively. The facilities are amortising from April 30, 2023 with maturity in 2025;\n- \u00b7 On December 23, 2020 Aer Lingus entered into a floating rate financing agreement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for \u20ac75 million. The facility has a three-year term;\n- \u00b7 On February 22, 2021, British Airways entered into a 5 year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac2.2 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF.\n\nFurther information is given in note 23.\n\n## i Renewal of the American Express commercial partnership\n\nUnder the renewal of the multi-year commercial partnership with American Express, the Group took into account the liquidity requirements in the light of COVID-19 in negotiating an upfront payment of \u20ac830 million (\u00a3754 million) related to the fulfilment of future performance obligations, which included the pre-purchase of Avios. This upfront payment has been recorded within Deferred revenue from ticket sales until such time as the fulfilment of the associated performance obligations. Further information is given in note 21.\n\n## j Government assistance\n\nGiven the significant reduction in operations that have occurred during 2020, the Group has availed itself of the various employee support mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates. This has led to an amount of \u20ac344 million being received directly from governments (classified as government grants) and savings of \u20ac214 million (classified as government assistance) where employees have been paid directly by their respective governments. Those amounts received in the form of government assistance have been recorded net within Employee costs. Further information is given in note 32.\n\n157\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

The deferral of such contributions amounted to \u20ac165 million. On February 19, 2021 British Airways reached further agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions through to September 30, 2021. The deferral of such contributions will amount to \u20ac330 million. Further information is given in note 30 on the deferral of contributions in 2020 and note 34 on the deferral of contributions in 2021.\n\n## l Sale and repurchase agreements for emission allowances\n\nThe Group typically is either issued with or acquires emissions allowances in advance of the associated flight activity. Due to the unprecedented decline in capacity during 2020, the Group has entered into a number of sale and repurchase agreements for emission allowances, where the Group has sold the excess allowances with a commitment to repurchase them in 2021. As at December 31, 2020, the value of such emission sale and repurchase agreements was \u20ac97 million. These sale and repurchase transactions give rise to a liability for the repurchase, which is classified as an other financing liability. Further information is given in note 23a.\n\n## m Renegotiation of Air Europa acquisition\n\nOn November 4, 2019, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Air Europa for \u20ac1 billion, subject to receipt of the approval by the European Commission. During the course of 2020 and as a result of the impact COVID-19 has had on both the Group and Air Europa, the Group had been negotiating with the current shareholder of Air Europa regarding amending the agreement to better reflect the current economic environment. On January 19, 2021, the Group announced the successful completion of these negotiations, which has resulted in the reduction of the purchase price to \u20ac500 million and deferred this payment until the sixth anniversary of the date of completion of the acquisition conditional on the satisfactory negotiation between Iberia and SEPI regarding the non-financial terms associated with the financial support provided by SEPI to Iberia. The transaction is still subject to approval by the European Commission. Further information is given in note 34.\n\n## 4  Segment information\n\n## a Business segments\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, and has been identified as the IAG Management Committee (IAG MC).\n\nThe Group has a number of entities which are managed as individual operating companies including airline and platform functions. Each airline operates its network operations as a single business unit and the IAG MC assesses performance based on measures including operating profit, and makes resource allocation decisions for the airlines based on network profitability, primarily by reference to the passenger markets in which the companies operate. The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimise consolidated financial results.\n\nThe Group has determined its operating segments based on the way that it treats its businesses and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made. British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus have been identified for financial reporting purposes as reportable operating segments. IAG Loyalty and LEVEL are also operating segments but do not exceed the quantitative thresholds to be reportable and management has concluded that there are currently no other reasons why they should be separately disclosed.\n\nThe platform functions of the business primarily support the airline operations. These activities are not considered to be reportable operating segments as they either earn revenues incidental to the activities of the Group and resource allocation decisions are made based on the passenger business or are not reviewed regularly by the IAG MC and are included within Other Group companies.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n158",

The Group either controls the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax consequences would arise from their reversal to a material extent.\n\n## Tax rate changes\n\nA reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17 per cent (effective April 1, 2020) was substantively enacted on September 6, 2016. This reduction from 19 per cent to 17 per cent was reversed in Finance Act 2020, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly.\n\n## g Tax related contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has certain contingent liabilities, across all taxes, which at December 31, 2020 amounted to \u20ac166 million (December 31, 2019: \u20ac165 million). No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. The tax related contingent liabilities include the following:\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n164",

        "page_content": "## Merger gain\n\nFollowing tax audits covering the period 2011 to 2014, the Spanish Tax Authorities issued a corporate income tax assessment to the Company regarding the merger in 2011 between British Airways and Iberia. The maximum exposure in this case is \u20ac92 million (2019: \u20ac90 million), being the amount in the tax assessment with an estimate of the interest accrued on that assessment through to December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Company appealed the assessment to the Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central or 'TEAC' (Central Administrative Tax Tribunal). On October 23, 2019 the TEAC ruled in favour of the Spanish Tax Authorities. The Company subsequently appealed this ruling to the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) on December 20, 2019, and on July 24, 2020 filed submissions in support of its case. The Company does not expect a hearing at the National High Court until 2022 at the earliest.\n\nThe Company disputes the technical merits of the assessment and ruling of the TEAC, both in terms of whether a gain arose and in terms of the quantum of any gain. The Company believes that it has strong arguments to support its appeals. The Company does not consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts and accordingly has recognised this matter as a contingent liability.\n\n## 10 Earnings per share\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                                       | 2020              | 2019        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| (Losses)/earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent for basic (losses)/earnings                      | (6,923)           | 1,715       |\n| Interest expense on convertible bonds                                                                           | -                 | 26          |\n| Diluted (losses)/earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent and diluted (losses)/earnings per  share | (6,923)           | 1,741       |\n|                                                                                                                 | 2020 Number  '000 | 2019 Number |\n|                                                                                                                 |                   | '000 1      |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 2                                                           | 3,528,052         | 3,055,638   |\n| Assumed conversion on convertible bonds                                                                         | -                 | 59,398      |\n| Dilutive employee share schemes outstanding                                                                     | -                 | 22,305      |\n| Weighted average number for diluted earnings per share                                                          | 3,528,052         | 3,137,341   |\n| \u20ac cents                                                                                                         | 2020              | 2019 1      |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                                        | (196.2)           | 56.1        |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                                                      | (196.2)           | 55.5        |\n\nThe effect of the assumed conversion of the IAG \u20ac500 million convertible bond 2022 and outstanding employee share schemes is antidilutive for the year to December 31, 2020, and therefore has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.\n\nThe calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share before exceptional items is included in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## 11  Dividends\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                                                     | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash dividend declared                              |        |        |\n| Interim dividend for 2019 of 14.5 \u20ac cents per share | -      | 288    |\n| Final dividend for 2019 of 17.0 \u20ac cents per share   | -      | 337    |\n| Special dividend for 2018 of 35.0 \u20ac cents per share | -      | 695    |\n\nProposed dividends on ordinary shares are subject to approval at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and, subject to approval, are recognised as a liability on that date.\n\nAs a result of the impact of COVID-19, on April 2, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Group resolved to withdraw the proposal to the subsequent Annual Shareholders' Meeting to pay a final dividend for 2019 of 17.0 \u20ac cents per share.\n\nThe dividend paid in the year to December 31, 2020 of \u20ac53 million relates to the withholding tax on the 2019 interim dividend, which was proposed in October 2019.\n\n165\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements",

The Group has applied this practical expedient to all such modifications in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The net impact on the Income statement for 2020 has been a credit of \u20ac2 million reflecting the changes to lease payments that arose from such concessions.\n\n## c Amounts recognised in the Consolidated cash flow statement\n\nThe Group had total cash outflows for leases of \u20ac1,997 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac2,057 million).\n\nThe Group had total cash inflows associated with sale and leaseback transactions of \u20ac898 million (2019: \u20ac824 million).\n\nThe Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) as at December 31, 2020, for which no amount has been recognised in relation to leases not yet commenced to which the Group is committed of \u20ac183 million (2019: \u20ac787 million).\n\n## d Maturity profile of the lease liabilities.\n\nThe maturity profile of the lease liabilities is disclosed in note 25e.\n\n## e Extension options\n\nThe Group has certain leases which contain extension options exercisable by the Group prior to the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.\n\nThe Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) as at December 31, 2020, for which no amount has been recognised, for potential extension options of \u20ac998 million (2019: \u20ac871 million) due to it not being reasonably certain that these leases will be extended.\n\n## 14  Capital expenditure commitments\n\nCapital expenditure authorised and contracted for but not provided for in the accounts amounts to \u20ac10,545 million (December 31, 2019: \u20ac12,830 million). The majority of capital expenditure commitments are denominated in US dollars, and as such are subject to changes in exchange rates.\n\nThe outstanding commitments include \u20ac10,485 million for the acquisition of 26 Airbus A320s (from 2021 to 2025), 38 Airbus A321s (from 2021 to 2024), 1 Airbus A330-300 (in 2021), 26 Airbus A350s (from 2021 to 2024), 18 Boeing 777-9s (from 2024 to 2027), 10 Boeing 787-10s (from 2021 to 2024) and 2 Embraer E190s (in 2021). The Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at December 31, 2020.\n\n168",

The details of these scenarios are given in the going concern section of note 2, with a weighting of 70 per cent to the base case and 30 per cent to the downside case. Cash flow projections are based on the business plans approved by the relevant operating companies covering a three-year period. Cash flows extrapolated beyond the three-year period are projected to increase based on long-term growth rates. Cash flow projections are discounted using each CGU's pre-tax discount rate.\n\nAnnually the relevant operating companies prepare and approve three-year business plans, and the Board approved the Group three-year business plan in the fourth quarter of the year. The business plan cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations reflect the Group's estimated climate related impacts that are foreseeable and reflect all restructuring of the business where relevant that has been approved by the Board and which can be executed by Management under existing agreements.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe value-in-use calculations for each CGU reflected the increased risks arising from COVID-19, including updated projected cash flows for the decreased activity from 2021 through to the end of 2023 and an increase in the pre-tax discount rates to incorporate increased equity market volatility. For each of the Group's CGUs the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:\n\n2020\n\n| Per cent                      | British  Airways   | Iberia   | Vueling   | Aer Lingus   | IAG Loyalty   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|\n| Operating margin              | (20)-16            | (12)-11  | (22)-12   | (14)-13      | 25-27         |\n| ASK as a proportion of 2019 1 | 45-95              | 49-98    | 46-107    | 40-100       | n/a           |\n| Long-term growth rate         | 2.1                | 2.0      | 1.8       | 1.9          | 2.0           |\n| Pre-tax discount rate         | 11.2               | 11.6     | 11.5      | 10.4         | 10.3          |\n\n|                              | 2019             | 2019   | 2019    | 2019       | 2019        |\n|------------------------------|------------------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                     | British  Airways | Iberia | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin             | 15               | 10-15  | 10-14   | 13-15      | 20-23       |\n| Average ASK growth per annum | 2-4              | 3      | 1-5     | 2-11       | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate        | 2.2              | 1.8    | 1.5     | 1.8        | 1.8         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate        | 8.0              | 9.1    | 9.4     | 8.0        | 8.5         |\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n170",

The airlines' network plans are reviewed annually as part of the Business plan and reflect Management's plans in response to specific market risk or opportunity.\n\nPre-tax discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and underlying risks of its primary market. The discount rate calculation is based on the circumstances of the airline industry, the Group and the CGU. It is derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into consideration both debt and equity available to airlines. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by airline investors and the cost of debt is derived from both market data and the Group's existing debt structure. CGU specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors which are evaluated annually based on available market data. The pre-tax discount rate reflects the timing of future tax flows.\n\nJet fuel price assumptions are derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter of each year and sourced externally. The cash flow forecasts reflect these price increases after taking into consideration of level of fuel derivatives and their associated prices that the Group has in place.\n\n## Summary of results\n\nAt December 31, 2020 Management reviewed the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs and concluded the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying values.\n\nReasonable possible changes in key assumptions, both individually and in combination, have been considered for each CGU, where applicable, which include reducing the operating margin by 2 per cent in each year, ASKs by 5 per cent in each year, long-term growth rates in the terminal value calculation to zero, increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.5 percentage points, changing the weighting of the base case and the downside case to be 100 per cent weighted towards the downside case, and increasing the fuel price by 40 per cent. These sensitivities, in part, incorporate the potential impact that climate related risks would have on the Group.\n\nFor the British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus CGUs, while the recoverable amounts are estimated to exceed the carrying amounts by \u20ac8,702 million, \u20ac1,701 million and \u20ac1,348 million, respectively, the recoverable amounts would be below the carrying amounts when applying reasonable possible changes in assumptions in each of the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 British Airways : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 19 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 36 per cent higher;\n- \u00b7 Iberia : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a reduction of the long-term growth rate to 0.2 per cent; and (ii) if operating margin had been two per cent lower combined with a reduction of the long-term growth rate to 1.7 per cent; (iii) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 8 per cent; and (iv) if the fuel price had been 20 per cent higher; and\n- \u00b7 Aer Lingus : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 26 per cent.\n\nFor the remainder of the reasonable possible changes in key assumptions applied to the British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus CGUs and for all the reasonable possible changes in key assumptions applied to the remaining CGUs, no impairment arises.\n\nFor impairment charges recognised in relation to landing rights and fleet assets stood down permanently at December 31, 2020, refer to note 3 and the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## 16  Investments\n\n## a Investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 are listed in the Group investments section.\n\nAll subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary undertakings held directly do not differ from the proportion of ordinary shares held. There have been no significant changes in ownership interests of subsidiaries during the year.\n\nThe total non-controlling interest at December 31, 2020 is \u20ac6 million (2019: \u20ac6 million).\n\nBritish Airways Employee Benefit Trustee (Jersey) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Airways, governs the British Airways Plc Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust). The Trust is not a legal subsidiary of IAG; however, it is consolidated within the Group results.\n\n171\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

        "page_content": "Deferred revenue relating to customer loyalty programmes consists primarily of revenue allocated to performance obligations associated with Avios. Avios are issued by the Group's airlines through their loyalty programmes, or are sold to third parties such as credit card providers, who issue them as part of their loyalty programme. Avios do not have an expiry date and can be redeemed at any time in the future. Revenue may therefore be recognised at any time in the future.\n\nDeferred revenue in respect of sales in advance of carriage consists of revenue allocated to airline tickets to be used for future travel. Typically these tickets expire within 12 months after the planned travel date, if they are not used within that time period, however, with the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has extended the expiry period up to 24 months after the planned travel date, depending on the operating company.\n\n## 22 Other long-term liabilities\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                              |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-current trade creditors  |     49 |      6 |\n| Accruals and deferred income |     91 |     65 |\n|                              |    140 |     71 |\n\n## 23 Long-term borrowings\n\n## a Current\n\n| \u20ac million                                  | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bank and other loans                       | 90     | 75     |\n| Bank and other loans less than 12 months 1 | 329    | -      |\n| Asset financed liabilities                 | 139    | 74     |\n| Other financing liabilities 2              | 97     | -      |\n| Lease liabilities                          | 1,560  | 1,694  |\n| Interest-bearing borrowings                | 2,215  | 1,843  |\n\n## b Non-current\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bank and other loans        | 2,950  | 1,879  |\n| Asset financed liabilities  | 2,050  | 1,180  |\n| Lease liabilities           | 8,464  | 9,352  |\n| Interest-bearing borrowings | 13,464 | 12,411 |\n\nBanks and other loans are repayable up to the year 2027.

        "page_content": "## 24 Provisions continued\n\n## Restoration and handback provisions\n\nThe provision for restoration and handback costs is maintained to meet the contractual maintenance and return conditions on aircraft held under lease. The provision also includes an amount relating to leased land and buildings where restoration costs are contractually required at the end of the lease. Such costs are capitalised within ROU assets. The provision is long-term in nature, typically covering the leased asset term, which for aircraft is up to 12 years.\n\nDuring 2020, as part of certain lease modifications, these pre-existing restoration and handback conditions have been removed and the associated provision released to the Income statement.\n\nWithin the amounts included in the additions to this provision is \u20ac37 million relating to the recognition of contractual lease provisions, representing the estimation of the additional cost to fulfil the handback conditions associated with the aforementioned leased aircraft that have been permanently stood down and impaired.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nIncluded within the restructuring provision is an amount of \u20ac72 million that relates to the voluntary and compulsory redundancies arising in British Airways, Aer Lingus and LEVEL from the restructuring plans related to COVID-19. While the majority of employees affected by these restructuring plans had left the Group as at December 31, 2020, there remains a small portion of employees expected to leave the Group over 2021. Refer to note 3 and the Alternative performance measures section for further information.\n\nIn addition, the restructuring provision includes provisions for voluntary redundancies including the collective redundancy programme for Iberia's Transformation Plan implemented prior to 2020, which provides for payments to affected employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The amount provided for has been determined by an actuarial valuation made by independent actuaries, and was based on the same assumptions as those made to determine the provisions for obligations to flight crew below, with the exception of the discount rate, which in this case was 0.00 per cent. The payments related to this provision will continue over the next eight years.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, \u20ac428 million of this provision related to collective redundancy programmes (2019: \u20ac513 million).\n\n## Employee leaving indemnities and other employee related provisions\n\nThis provision includes employees leaving indemnities relating to staff under various contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision relating to flight crew who, having met certain conditions, have the option of being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement. The Group is required to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age, and an initial provision was recognised based on an actuarial valuation. The provision was reviewed at December 31, 2020 with the use of independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on a discount rate consistent with the iBoxx index of 0.37 per cent and 0.00 per cent (2019: iBoxx index of 0.59 per cent and 0.00 per cent) depending on whether the employees are currently active or not, the PERM/F-2000P mortality tables, and assuming a 1.50 per cent annual increase (2019: 1.50 per cent annual increase) in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is mainly a long-term provision. The amount relating to this provision was \u20ac654 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: \u20ac600 million).\n\n## Legal claims provisions\n\nLegal claims provisions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Amounts for multi-party claims from groups of employees on a number of matters related to its operations, including claims for additional holiday pay and for age discrimination; and\n- \u00b7 Amounts related to investigations by a number of competition authorities in connection with alleged anti-competitive activity concerning the Group's passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nThe final amount required to pay the remaining claims and fines is subject to uncertainty (note 31).\n\nReclassifications from legal claims provisions include an amount of \u20ac22 million relating to the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018, which following the issue of the penalty notice by the UK Information Commissioner's Office on October 16, 2020 has been reclassified to Other creditors.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions include a provision for the Emissions Trading Scheme for CO2 emitted on flights within the EU in excess of the EU Emission Allowances granted.\n\n178",

        "page_content": "## 25 Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fuel price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), counterparty risk and liquidity risk. Further information on the Group's financial exposure to these risks is disclosed on note 26. The Board approves the key strategic principles and the risk appetite, defining the amount of risk that the Group is prepared to retain. The Group's financial risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the risk of incremental costs arising from adverse financial markets movements.\n\nThe Group Treasury department is responsible for the oversight of the financial risk management. Fuel price fluctuations, euro-US dollar and sterling-US dollar exchange rate volatility represents the largest financial risks facing the Group. Other foreign exchange currencies and interest rate risks are also the subject of the Financial Risk Management. The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee approves the Group hedging profile and delegates to the operating company Risk Committee to agree on the degree of flexibility in applying the approved hedging levels. Each operating company Risk Committee meets at least once a month to review and approve a mandate to place hedging cover in the market including the instruments to be used.\n\nThe Group Treasury department provides a bi-annual report on the hedging position to the IAG Management Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee. The Board reviews the strategy and risk appetite once a year.\n\n## a Fuel price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to fuel price risk. The Group's fuel price risk management strategy aims to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in fuel prices while aiming that the Group is not competitively disadvantaged in the event of a substantial fall in the price. The Group Treasury Policies determine the list of approved over the counter (OTC) derivative instruments that can be contracted with approved counterparties.\n\nThe Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of fuel consumption up to three years within the approved hedging profile.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial instruments to a reasonable possible change in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant, on result before tax and equity:\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n| Increase/(decrease)   in fuel price   per cent   | Effect on result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on equity  \u20ac million   | Increase/(decrease)  in fuel price  per cent   | Effect on result before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on equity  \u20ac million   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 30                                               | 189                                       | 525                           | 30                                             | -                                        | 1,774                         |\n| (30)                                             | (219)                                     | (664)                         | (30)                                           | -                                        | (1,824)                       |\n\nDuring the year to December 31, 2020, following a substantial fall in the global price of crude oil and associated products, the fair value of such net liability derivative instruments was \u20ac778 million at December 31, 2020, representing a loss of \u20ac650 million since January 1, 2020, which was recognised in Other comprehensive income. In addition, with the substantial decline in demand for air travel and the grounding of the majority of the fleet during the second quarter of 2020, a significant proportion of the associated hedge relationships were no longer expected to occur and subsequently fuel hedge accounting was discontinued. As a result of this discontinuance, \u20ac1,781 million of the losses were reclassified to the Income statement and recognised within Fuel, oil costs and emission costs.\n\nThe loss arising from the discontinuance of fuel hedge accounting has been recorded as an exceptional item. Refer to note 3 and the Alternative performance measures section for further details.\n\n## b Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group presents its consolidated financial statements in euros, has subsidiaries with functional currencies in euro and pound sterling, and conducts business in a number of different countries. Consequently the Group is exposed to currency risk on revenue, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily euro, US dollar and pound sterling. The Group generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business. The US dollar is an exception as fuel purchases, maintenance expenses and debt repayments denominated in US dollars typically create a deficit.\n\nThe Group has a number of strategies to hedge foreign currency risk. The operational US dollar short position is subject to the same governance structure as the fuel hedging strategy set out above. The Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of up to three years within the approved hedging profile.\n\nEach operating company hedges its net balance sheet assets and liabilities in US dollars through a rolling hedging programme using a number of derivative instruments to minimise the profit and loss volatility arising from revaluation of these items into its functional currency. British Airways utilises its euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan debt repayments as a hedge of future euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan revenues.\n\n179\n\nFinancial Statements",

Similar to the fuel price risk above, a significant proportion of the hedge relationships associated with fuel foreign currency derivatives and revenue foreign currency derivatives were no longer expected to occur and subsequently were discontinued. As a result of this discontinuance, \u20ac116 million of the gains associated with the fuel foreign currency derivatives and \u20ac56 million of the losses associated with the revenue foreign currency derivatives were reclassified to the Income statement and recognised within Fuel, oil costs and emission costs and within Passenger revenue, respectively.\n\nThe gain arising from the discontinuance of foreign currency hedge accounting has been recorded as an exceptional item. Refer to note 3 and the Alternative performance measures section for further details.\n\n## c Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on financial debt, leases, sale and lease backs and on cash deposits.\n\nInterest rate risk on floating rate debt is managed through a list of approved OTC derivative instruments that can be contracted with approved counterparties. After taking into account the impact of these derivatives, 64 per cent of the Group's borrowings were at fixed rates and 36 per cent were at floating rates.\n\nAll cash deposits are generally on tenors less than one year. The interest rate is predominantly fixed for the tenor of the deposit.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's interest rate exposure to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates, on result before tax and equity:\n\nStrengthening/\n\n|      | (weakening) in   US interest  rate  Basis points   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | (weakening) in  euro interest  rate  Basis points   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | (weakening) in  sterling interest   rate  Basis points   | Effect on  result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2020 | 50                                                 | -                                          | -                               | 50                                                  | 9                                          | (8)                             | 50                                                       | -                                          | -                               |\n| 2020 | (50)                                               | -                                          | -                               | (50)                                                | (9)                                        | 7                               | (50)                                                     | -                                          | -                               |\n| 2019 | 50                                                 | -                                          | 19                              | 50                                                  | (2)                                        | 16                              | 50                                                       | 2                                          | -                               |\n| 2019 | (50)                                               | -                                          | (19)                            | (50)                                                | 2                                          | (13)                            | (50)                                                     | (2)                                        | -                               |\n\nStrengthening/\n\nStrengthening/\n\nFor details regarding the Group's management of interest rate benchmark reform, refer to note 25h.\n\n## d Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial assets receivable. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor the risk by assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company. The underlying exposures are monitored on a daily basis and the overall exposure limit by counterparty is periodically reviewed by using available market information.\n\nThe financial assets recognised in the financial statements, net of impairment losses (if any), represent the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking account any guarantees in place or other credit enhancements.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group's credit risk position, allocated by region, in respect of treasury managed cash and derivatives was as follows:\n\n|                  | Mark-to-market of treasury  controlled financial   instruments allocated by  geography 2020  2019   | Mark-to-market of treasury  controlled financial   instruments allocated by  geography 2020  2019   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Region           |                                                                                                     |                                                                                                     |\n| United Kingdom   | 53%                                                                                                 | 41%                                                                                                 |\n| Spain            | 3%                                                                                                  | 3%                                                                                                  |\n| Ireland          | 7%                                                                                                  | 3%                                                                                                  |\n| Rest of Eurozone | 16%                                                                                                 | 30%                                                                                                 |\n| Rest of world    | 21%                                                                                                 | 23%                                                                                                 |\n\n180",

For the year to December 31, 2020, the net debt to EBITDA was minus 4.3 times (2019: 1.4 times).

The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its risk management and hedge accounting.\n\nGroup Treasury monitors and manages the Group's transition to alternative rates. Group Treasury tracks which contracts reference IBOR, whether such contracts will need to be amended, and how to manage communication about IBOR reform with counterparties.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group holds interest rate swaps for risk management purposes which are designated in cash flow hedge relationships. The interest rate swaps have floating legs that are indexed to both US dollar and sterling LIBOR.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group has evaluated the extent to which its cash flow hedging relationships are subject to uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at December 31, 2020. As part of this evaluation, the Group has applied the hedging relief provided by the IFRS 9 amendments for IBOR reform phase one. Certain of the Group's hedged items and hedging instruments continue to be indexed to the aforementioned LIBORs. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash flows are exchanged with counterparties as usual. However, certain of these LIBOR cash flow hedging relationships extend beyond the anticipated cessation date. There is uncertainty about when and how replacement may occur with respect to the relevant hedged items and hedging instruments. Such uncertainty may impact the hedging relationship.\n\nHedging relationships impacted by IBOR reform may experience ineffectiveness attributable to market participant's expectations of when the change in rates will occur, which may differ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe Group's exposure to both US dollar and sterling LIBOR designated in hedging relationships had a nominal amount of \u20ac775 million as at December 31, 2020.\n\n## 26 Financial instruments\n\n## a Financial assets and liabilities by category\n\nThe detail of the Group's financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 by nature and classification for measurement purposes is as follows:\n\n## December 31, 2020\n\n|                                         | Financial assets   | Financial assets                                 | Financial assets                       |                         |                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                               | Amortised  cost    | Fair value  through Other  comprehensive  income | Fair value  through  Income  statement | Non-  financial  assets | Total carrying  amount by  balance sheet  item |\n| Non-current assets                      |                    |                                                  |                                        |                         |                                                |\n| Other equity investments                | -

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. Level 1 methodologies (market values at the balance sheet date) were used to determine the fair value of listed asset investments classified as equity investments and listed interest-bearing borrowings.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. Derivative instruments are measured based on the market value of instruments with similar terms and conditions at the balance sheet date using forward pricing models. The fair value of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings including leases is determined by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows at the relevant market interest rates at the balance sheet date.\n\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The principal method of such valuation is performed using a valuation model that considers the present value of the dividend cash flows expected to be generated by the associated assets.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other current interest-bearing deposits, trade receivables, other current assets and trade and other payables approximate their carrying value largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n\n184",

Remeasurement gains and losses on the loans are recognised in equity and transferred to the income statement within revenue when the loan is repaid (generally in instalments over the life of the loan).\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange contracts, hedging foreign currency exchange risk on revenue cash inflows and certain operational payments. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in equity and transferred to the income statement or balance sheet to match against the related cash inflow or outflow. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement within fuel, oil costs and emissions charges when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n- \u00b7 Forward crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts, hedging price risk on fuel expenditure. Remeasurement gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in equity and transferred to the income statement within fuel, oil costs and emissions charges to match against the related fuel cash outflow. Reclassification gains and losses on derivatives, arising from the discontinuance of hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement within fuel, oil costs and emissions charges when the future transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n- \u00b7 Interest rate contracts, hedging interest rate risk on floating rate debt and certain operational payments.\n\nThe amounts included in equity including the periods over which the related cash flows are expected to occur are summarised below:\n\n(Gains)/losses in respect of cash flow hedges included within equity\n\n| \u20ac million                                                            |       | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Loan repayments to hedge future revenue                              | 220   | 141    |\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and expenditure 1 | 168   | (80)   |\n| Crude, gas oil and jet kerosene derivative contracts 1               | 295   | 113    |\n| Derivatives used to hedge interest rates 1                           | 66    | 72     |\n| Instruments for which hedge accounting no longer applies 1           | 276   | 355    |\n|                                                                      | 1,025 | 601    |\n| Related deferred tax credit                                          | (168) | (94)   |\n| Total amount included within equity                                  | 857   | 507    |\n\n2020\n\nThe notional amounts of significant financial instruments used as cash flow hedging instruments are set out below:\n\n| Notional principal amounts  (\u20ac million)                                                                 | Hedge range   | Within 1 year   | 1-2 years   |   2-5 years | Total  December 31,  2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and  expenditure from US dollars to pound sterling 1 | 1.15 - 1.50   | 2,402           | 1,321       |         442 | 4,165                       |\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and  expenditure from US dollars to euros 1          | 0.74 - 1.37   | 1,009           | 960         |         155 | 2,124                       |\n\n1\n\nRepresents the value of the hedged item.\n\n| Notional principal amounts  (\u20ac million)                                                                 | Hedge range   | Within 1 year   | 1-2 years   | 2-5 years   | Total  December 31,  2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and  expenditure from US dollars to pound sterling 1 | 1.17-1.51     | 3,493           | 1,810       | 1,359       | 6,662                       |\n| Foreign exchange contracts to hedge future revenue and  expenditure from US dollars to euros 1          | 0.74 - 1.39   | 1,397           | 1,091       | 483         | 2,971                       |\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n186",

A corresponding amount has been recognised within Capital reserves (note 29).\n\n## b Rights issue\n\nOn October 2, 2020, the Company raised \u20ac2,741 million (and incurred related transaction costs of \u20ac70 million as detailed in Note 29) through a rights issue of 2,979,443,376 new ordinary shares at a price of 92 \u20ac cents per share on the basis of 3 shares for every 2 existing shares.\n\nIn accordance with accounting standards, the discount element inherent in the rights issue has been accounted for as a bonus issue of 1,071,565 thousand shares. Earnings per share information (note 10) has been restated for the comparative period presented, by adjusting the weighted average number of shares to include the impact of the bonus shares.\n\n## c Treasury shares\n\nA total of 2.6 million shares were issued to employees during the year as a result of vesting of employee share schemes. At December 31, 2020 the Group held 5.1 million shares (2019: 7.7 million) which represented 0.10 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\n## 28 Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates share-based payment schemes as part of the total remuneration package provided to employees. These schemes comprise both share option schemes where employees acquire shares at an option price and share award plans whereby shares are issued to employees at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.\n\n## a IAG Performance Share Plan\n\nThe IAG Performance Share Plan (PSP) is granted to senior executives and managers of the Group who are most directly involved in shaping and delivering business success over the medium to long term. Since 2015, awards have been made as nil-cost options, with a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period, before options can be exercised. All awards since 2015 have three independent performance measures with equal weighting: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure Index (for 2020 awards) or MSCI European Transportation Index (for prior to 2020 awards), earnings per share, and Return on Invested Capital.\n\nIn 2020, the outstanding PSP awards granted to participants other than Executive Directors from 2018 onwards were modified, and the resulting incremental fair value granted of \u00a31.61 per award is recognised over the remaining vesting period.\n\n## b IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan\n\nThe IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP) is granted to qualifying employees based on performance and service tests. It will be awarded when an incentive award is triggered subject to the employee remaining in employment with the Group for three years after the grant date. The relevant population will receive 50 per cent of their incentive award up front in cash, and the remaining 50 per cent in shares after three years through the IADP.\n\n## c Share-based payment schemes summary\n\nVested and\n\n|                                | Outstanding  at January 1,  2020  '000s   | Granted  number '000s   | Rights issue  adjustment '000s   | Lapsed  number '000s   | Vested  number  '000s   | Outstanding  at December  31, 2020  '000s   | exercisable  December 31,  2020 '000s   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Performance Share Plans        | 19,178                                    | 7,388                   | 11,323                           | 3,275                  | 1,814                   | 32,800                                      | 1,299                                   |\n| Incentive Award Deferral Plans | 4,473                                     | 1,694                   | 2,795                            | 12                     | 583                     | 8,367                                       | 14                                      |\n|                                | 23,651                                    | 9,082                   | 14,118                           | 3,287                  | 2,397                   | 41,167                                      | 1,313                                   |\n\nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise of options exercised during the year to December 31, 2020 was \u00a33.89 (2019: not applicable).\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n188",

The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The fair value of the PSP also takes into account a market condition of TSR as compared to strategic competitors. No other features of share-based payment plans granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.\n\nThe Group recognised a share-based payment charge credit of \u20ac8 million for the year to December 31, 2020 (2019: \u20ac34 million).\n\n## 29 Other reserves and non-controlling interests\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2020\n\n|                                                                    | Other reserves                  | Other reserves              | Other reserves          | Other reserves                          | Other reserves    | Other reserves      | Other reserves        |                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                          | Unrealised  gains and  losses 1 | Cost of  hedging  reserve 2 | Currency  translation 3 | Equity  portion of  convertible  bond 4 | Merger  reserve 5 | Capital  reserves 6 | Total other  reserves | Non- controlling  interest |\n| January 1, 2020                                                    | (464)                           | 60                          | 160                     | 62                                      | (2,467)           | 70                  | (2,579)               | 6                          |\n| Other comprehensive loss for the  year:                            |                                 |                             |                         |                                         |                   |                     |                       |                            |\n| Cash flow hedges reclassified  and reported in net loss:           |                                 |                             |                         |                                         |                   |                     |                       |                            |\n| Passenger revenue                                                  | 50                              | -

The Group also has a scheme for flight crew who meet certain conditions and therefore have the option of being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement (note 24).\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees.\n\nCosts recognised in respect of defined contribution pension plans in Spain, UK and Ireland for the year to December 31, 2020 were \u20ac235 million (2019: \u20ac262 million).\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\n## APS and NAPS\n\nThe principal funded defined benefit pension schemes within the Group are the Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and the New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS), both of which are in the UK and are closed to new members. NAPS has been closed to new members since 2004 and closed to future accrual since 2018, resulting in a reduction of the defined benefit obligation. Following closure members' deferred pensions will now be increased annually by inflation up to five per cent per annum (measured using the Government's annual Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on CPI). As part of the closure of NAPS to future accrual in 2018, British Airways agreed to make certain additional transition payments to NAPS members if the deficit had reduced more than expected at either the 2018 or 2021 valuations. No payment was triggered by the 2018 valuation and no allowance for such payments has been made in the valuation of the defined benefit obligation on the expected outcome of the 2021 valuation. The NAPS actuarial valuation at March 31, 2018 resulted in a deficit of \u20ac2,736 million.\n\nAPS has been closed to new members since 1984, but remains open to future accrual. The benefits provided under APS are based on final average pensionable pay and, for the majority of members, are subject to inflationary increases in payment. The APS actuarial valuation at March 31, 2018 resulted in a surplus of \u20ac683 million.\n\n190",

        "page_content": "APS and NAPS are governed by separate Trustee Boards. Although APS and NAPS have separate Trustee Boards, much of the business of the two schemes is common. Some main Board and committee meetings are held in tandem although each Trustee Board reaches its decisions independently. There are three sub committees which are separately responsible for the governance, operation and investments of each scheme. British Airways Pension Trustees Limited holds the assets of both schemes on behalf of their respective Trustees.\n\nDeficit payment plans are agreed with the Trustee of each scheme every three years based on the actuarial valuation rather than the IAS 19 accounting valuation. In October 2019, the latest deficit recovery plan was agreed as at March 31, 2018 with respect to NAPS (see note 30i below). The actuarial valuations performed as at March 31, 2018 for APS and NAPS are different to the valuation performed as at December 31, 2019 under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' mainly due to timing differences of the measurement dates and to the specific scheme assumptions in the actuarial valuation compared with IAS 19 guidance used in the accounting valuation assumptions. For example, IAS 19 requires the discount rate to be based on corporate bond yields regardless of how the assets are actually invested, which may not result in the calculations in this report being a best estimate of the cost to the Group of providing benefits under either Scheme. The investment strategy of each Scheme is likely to change over its life, so the relationship between the discount rate and the expected rate of return on each Scheme's assets may also change.\n\n## Other plans\n\nBritish Airways provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benefits to eligible employees in the US through the US PostRetirement Medical Benefit plan (US PRMB) which is considered to be a defined benefit scheme. In addition, Aer Lingus operates certain defined benefit plans, both funded and unfunded.\n\nThe defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and market (investment) risk, including currency risk.\n\n## Cash payments\n\nCash payments in respect to pension obligations comprise normal employer contributions by the Group; deficit contributions based on the agreed deficit payment plan with APS and NAPS; and cash sweep payments relating to additional payments made conditional on the level of cash in British Airways. Total payments for the year to December 31, 2020 net of service costs were \u20ac313 million (2019: \u20ac865 million) being the employer contributions of \u20ac318 million (2019: \u20ac870 million) less the current service cost of \u20ac5 million (2019: \u20ac5 million) (note 30b).\n\nOn December 18, 2020 British Airways reached agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions on an interim basis for the period between October 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. On February 19, 2021 British Airways reached further agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions previously agreed in October 2019 on the March 31, 2018 valuation, through to September 30, 2021. Under this deferral agreement, the deferred payments will be incorporated into the future deficit payment plan and associated deficit contributions arising from the triennial valuation of the NAPS scheme as at March 31, 2021. If the future deficit payment plan has not been agreed by September 30, 2021, the default position is that British Airways will return to making payments of \u20ac41 million (\u00a338 million) per month from October 2021.\n\n## a Employee benefit schemes recognised on the Balance Sheet\n\n2020\n\n|                                     | 1       | 1        | 1     | 1        |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|----------|-------|----------|\n| \u20ac million                           | APS     | NAPS     | Other | Total    |\n| Scheme assets at fair value         | 8,537   | 22,240   | 408   | 31,185   |\n| Present value of scheme liabilities | (8,143) | (22,151) | (714) | (31,008) |\n| Net pension asset/(liability)       | 394     | 89       | (306) | 177      |\n| Effect of the asset ceiling 2       | (124)   | (479)    | -     | (603)    |\n| Other employee benefit obligations  | -       | -        | (11)  | (11)     |\n| December 31, 2020                   | 270     | (390)    | (317) | (437)    |\n| Represented by:                     |         |          |       |          |\n| Employee benefit assets             |         |          |       | 282      |\n| Employee benefit obligations        |         |          |       | (719)    |\n|                                     |         |          |       | (437)    |\n\n|                                     | 2019 3 1   | 2019 3 1   | 2019 3 1   | 2019 3 1   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| \u20ac million                           | APS        | NAPS       | Other      | Total      |\n| Scheme assets at fair value         | 8,830      | 22,423     | 428        | 31,681     |\n| Present value of scheme liabilities | (8,401)    | (21,650)   | (731)      | (30,782)   |\n| Net pension asset/(liability)       | 429        | 773        | (303)      | 899        |\n| Effect of the asset ceiling 2       | (127)      | (847)      | -          | (974)      |\n| Other employee benefit obligations  | -          | -          | (11)       | (11)       |\n| December 31, 2019                   | 302        | (74)       | (314)      | (86)       |\n| Represented by:                     |            |            |            |            |\n| Employee benefit assets             |            |            |            | 314        |\n| Employee benefit obligations        |            |            |            | (400)      |\n|                                     |            |            |            | (86)       |\n\n191\n\nFinancial Statements",

The latter is a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in the projected benefit obligation over time. The Trustees' investment committee adopts an annual business plan which sets out investment objectives and work required to support achievement of these objectives. The committee also deals with the monitoring of performance and activities, including work on developing the strategic benchmark to improve the risk return profile of the scheme where possible, as well as having a trigger based dynamic governance process to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The investment committee reviews the existing investment restrictions, performance benchmarks and targets, as well as continuing to develop the de-risking and liability hedging portfolio.\n\nBoth schemes use derivative instruments for investment purposes and to manage exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity risks arising in the normal course of business. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of Inflation-Linked Swap contracts. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n192",

At December 31, 2020, the benchmark for NAPS was 42.3 per cent (2019: 46 per cent) in return seeking assets and 57.8 per cent (2019: 54 per cent) in liability matching investments. Bandwidths are set around these strategic benchmarks that allow for tactical asset allocation decisions, providing parameters for the Investment Committee and their investment managers to work within. APS no longer has a 'strategic benchmark' as instead, APS now runs off its liquidation portfolio to a liability matching portfolio of bonds and cash. The actual asset allocation for APS at December 31, 2020 was 1.4 per cent (2019: 4 per cent) in return seeking assets and 98.6 per cent (2019: 96 per cent) in liability matching investments.\n\nAPS has an insurance contract with Rothesay Life which covers 24 per cent (2019: 24 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for an agreed list of members. The insurance contract is based on future increases to pensions in line with inflation and will match future obligations on that basis for that part of the scheme. The insurance contract can only be used to pay or fund employee benefits under the scheme. APS also has secured a longevity swap contract with Rothesay Life, which covers an additional 20 per cent (2019: 20 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for the same members covered by the insurance contract above. The value of the contract is based on the difference between the value of the payments expected to be received under this contract and the pensions payable by the scheme under the contract. The fees are linked to LIBOR, and an assumed future LIBOR rate has been derived based on swap prices at December 31, 2020.\n\nDuring 2018 the Trustee of APS secured a buy-in contract with Legal & General. The buy-in contract covers all members in receipt of pension from APS at March 31, 2018, excluding dependent children receiving a pension at that date and members in receipt of equivalent pension (EPB) only benefits, who are alive on October 1, 2018. Benefits coming into payment for retirements after March 31, 2018 are not covered. The contract covers benefits payable from October 1, 2018 onwards. The policy covers approximately 60 per cent of all benefits APS expects to pay out in future. Along with existing insurance products (the asset swap and longevity swaps with Rothesay Life), APS is now 90 per cent protected against all longevity risk and fully protected in relation to all pensions that were already being paid as at March 31, 2018. It is also more than 90 per cent protected against interest rates and inflation (on a Retail Price Index (RPI) basis).\n\n193\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

The present value of the contributions payable is expected to be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the plan. This determination has been made independently for each plan, subject to withholding taxes that would be payable by the Trustee.\n\nDeficit payments in respect of local arrangements outside of the UK have been determined in accordance with local practice.\n\nIn total, the Group expects to pay \u20ac126 million in employer contributions and deficit payments to the two significant post-retirement benefit plans in 2021. This is made up of \u20ac125 million of deficit payments for NAPS after giving consideration to the aforementioned contribution deferral agreement and ongoing employer contributions of \u20ac1 million for APS.\n\nUnder the contribution deferral agreement between British Airways and the Trustee of NAPS, in the period up to December 31, 2023, no dividend payment is permitted from British Airways to IAG. From 2024 onwards, any dividends paid by British Airways will be matched by contributions to NAPS of 50 per cent of the value of dividends paid. Any such payments to NAPS will reduce the outstanding repayment balance and are capped at that level. The requirement to make such payments to NAPS ceases after deferred contributions have been repaid.\n\n## 31  Contingent liabilities and guarantees\n\nDetails of contingent liabilities are set out below. The Group does not consider it probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources with regard to these proceedings and accordingly no provision for these proceedings has been recognised.\n\nContingent liabilities associated with income and deferred taxes are presented note 9. For information pertaining to previously reported contingent liabilities associated with the Airways Pension Scheme, refer to note 30. For information pertaining to previous contingent liabilities associated with the theft of customer data at British Airways that have been recognised as legal claims provisions refer to note 24.\n\nThere are a number of other legal and regulatory proceedings against the Group in a number of jurisdictions which at December 31, 2020 amounted to \u20ac56 million (December 31, 2019: \u20ac53 million).\n\nThe Group also has guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the normal course of business, which at December 31, 2020 are not expected to result in material losses for the Group.\n\n## 32 Government grants and assistance\n\nThe Group has availed itself of government grants and assistance as follows:\n\n## The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - recognised net within Employee costs\n\nThe CJRS was implemented by the Government of the United Kingdom from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, where those employees designated as being 'furloughed workers' were eligible to have 80 per cent of their wage costs paid up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\n\nFrom September 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, the level eligibility reduced to 70 per cent of wage costs and up to a maximum of \u00a32,197.50 per month. From October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020, the level of eligibility reduced to 60 per cent of wage costs and up to a maximum of \u00a31,875 per month. Following the introduction of further lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom in November 2020, the CJRS was extended from November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 and then further to March 31, 2021 with the level of eligibility increased to 80 per cent of wage costs and a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\n\nSuch costs are paid by the Government to the Group in arrears. The Group is obliged to continue to pay the associated social security costs and employer pension contributions.\n\n195\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

        "page_content": "## 32 Government grants and assistance continued\n\n## The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) - recognised net within Employee costs\n\nThe TWSS was implemented by the government of Ireland from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, where those employees designated as being furloughed workers are eligible to have 85 per cent of their wage costs paid up to a maximum of \u20ac410 per week. This scheme was replaced with the EWSS from September 1, 2020 and is expected to run through to March 31, 2021. For those qualifying employees (earning less than \u20ac1,462 per week), the government will reimburse wage costs up to a maximum of \u20ac350 per week. Such costs are paid by the government to the Group in arrears.\n\nThe total amount of the relief received under the CJRS, the TWSS and the EWSS by the Group during 2020 amounted to \u20ac344 million (2019: \u20acnil).\n\n## Temporary Redundancy Plan (ERTE) - no recognition in the financial statements of the Group\n\nThe ERTE was implemented by the government of Spain from March 1, 2020 and is expected to run through to May 31, 2021. Under this plan, employment is temporarily suspended and those designated employees are paid directly by the government and there is no remittance made to the Group. The Group is obliged to continue to pay the associated social security costs.\n\nHad those designated employees not been temporarily suspended during 2020, the Group would have incurred further employee costs of \u20ac214 million (2019: \u20acnil).\n\n## The Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF) - recognised within Short-term borrowings\n\nOn April 12, 2020, British Airways availed itself of the CCFF implemented by the Government of the United Kingdom. Under the CCFF, British Airways received \u20ac328 million (\u00a3298 million), with interest incurred at the prevailing market rate. Refer to note 23 for further details.\n\n## Syndicated financing agreements - recognised within Long-term borrowings\n\nOn April 30, 2020, Iberia and Vueling entered into syndicated financing agreements of \u20ac750 million and \u20ac260 million, respectively, with interest incurred at the prevailing market rate. The Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial ('ICO') in Spain has guaranteed 70 per cent of both financial agreements. Refer to note 23 for further details.\n\n## The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) - recognised within Long-term borrowings\n\nOn December, 23, 2020, Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement for \u20ac75 million under the ISIF. Refer to note 23 for further details.\n\n## The UK Export Finance (UKEF) - not recognised as at December 31, 2020\n\nOn December 31, 2020, British Airways entered into a 5 year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac2.2 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF.\n\n## 33 Related party transactions\n\nThe following transactions took place with related parties for the financial years to December 31:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n2020\n\n|                                            |    | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----|--------|\n| Sales of goods and services                |    |        |\n| Sales to associates and joint ventures 1   | 12 | 6      |\n| Sales to significant shareholders 2        | 23 | 32     |\n| Purchases of goods and services            |    |        |\n| Purchases from associates 3                | 42 | 76     |\n| Purchases from significant shareholders 2  | 80 | 149    |\n| Receivables from related parties           |    |        |\n| Amounts owed by associates 4               | 1  | 2      |\n| Amounts owed by significant shareholders 5 | 1  | 8      |\n| Payables to related parties                |    |        |\n| Amounts owed to associates 6               | 2  | 3      |\n| Amounts owed to significant shareholders 5 | 1  | 18     |\n\n- 6 Amounts owed to associates: Consisted primarily of \u20ac2 million due to Multiservicios Aeroportuarios, S.A., Empresa Hispano Cubana de Mantenimiento de Aeronaves, Ibeca, S.A., Viajes Ame S.A, Serpista, S.A. and Dunwoody (2019: \u20ac1 million due to Dunwoody and \u20ac2 million due to Multiservicios Aeroportuarios, S.A., Serpista, S.A. and Empresa Hispano Cubana de Mantenimiento de Aeronaves, Ibeca, S.A.).\n\nINTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP\n\n196",

Costs borne on behalf of the retirement benefit plans amounted to \u20ac7 million (2019: \u20ac9 million) in relation to the costs of the Pension Protection Fund levy.\n\nThe Group has transactions with related parties that are conducted in the normal course of the airline business, which include the provision of airline and related services. All such transactions are carried out on an arm's length basis.\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2020, the Group has not made any provision for expected credit loss arising relating to amounts owed by related parties (2019: nil).\n\n## Significant shareholders\n\nIn this instance, significant shareholders are those parties who have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the Group, as a result of their shareholdings in the Group, but who do not have control over these policies.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the Group had cash deposit balances with shareholders holding a participation of between 3 to 5 per cent, of \u20acnil (2019: \u20acnil).\n\n## Board of Directors and Management Committee remuneration\n\nCompensation received by the Group's Board of Directors and Management Committee, in 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n\n|                                | Year to December 31   | Year to December 31   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| \u20ac million                      | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Base salary, fees and benefits |                       |                       |\n| Board of Directors             |                       |                       |\n| Short-term benefits            | 3                     | 5                     |\n| Share based payments           | -                     | 3                     |\n| Management Committee           |                       |                       |\n| Short-term benefits            | 5                     | 8                     |\n| Share based payments           | -                     | 5                     |\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2020 the Board of Directors includes remuneration for three Executive Directors (December 31, 2019: three Executive Directors). The Management Committee includes remuneration for 14 members (December 31, 2019: 12 members).\n\nThe Company provides life insurance for all executive directors and the Management Committee. For the year to December 31, 2020 the Company's obligation was \u20ac38,000 (2019: \u20ac63,000).\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the transfer value of accrued pensions covered under defined benefit pension obligation schemes, relating to the current members of the Management Committee totalled \u20ac1 million (2019: \u20ac1 million).\n\nNo loan or credit transactions were outstanding with Directors or offices of the Group at December 31, 2020 (2019: nil).\n\n## 34 Post balance sheet events\n\nOn January 19, 2021, the Group amended the original agreement announced on November 4, 2019, under which the Group had agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Air Europa. The amendment agreement reduces the total expected consideration for the acquisition to \u20ac500 million, which would be payable on the sixth anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. The acquisition is subject to the completion of negotiations with Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales in Spain and approval from the European Commission. Until the completion of these negotiations and receipt of the relevant approvals, the acquisition does not meet the recognition criteria under IFRS 3 Business combinations, and no accounting has been made for the transaction in these consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn February 19, 2021 British Airways reached further agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to extend the deferral of deficit contributions through to September 30, 2021. The deferral of such contributions will amount to \u20ac330 million (\u00a3300 million). Under the contribution deferral agreement between British Airways and the Trustee of NAPS, in the period up to December 31, 2023, no dividend payment is permitted from British Airways to IAG. From 2024 onwards, any dividends paid by British Airways will be matched by contributions to NAPS of 50 per cent of the value of dividends paid. Any such payments to NAPS will reduce the outstanding repayment balance and are capped at that level. The requirement to make such payments to NAPS ceases after deferred contributions have been repaid.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, British Airways entered into a 5 year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac2.2 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF.\n\n197\n\nwww.iairgroup.com\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nAdditional Information",

        "page_content": "## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nThe performance of the Group is assessed using a number of alternative performance measures (APMs), some of which have been identified as key performance indicators of the Group. These measures are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), should be considered in addition to IFRS measurements and may differ to definitions given by regulatory bodies applicable to the Group. They are used to measure the outcome of the Group's strategy based on 'Unrivalled customer proposition', 'Value accretive and sustainable growth' and 'Efficiency and innovation'. Further information on why these APMs are used is provided in the Strategic priorities and key performance indicators section.\n\nThe definition of each APM, together with a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.\n\n## a  Changes to APMs in 2020\n\nThe Group has not adjusted its APMs policy for the impact of COVID-19. However, under the existing exceptional items definition, certain costs arising from the impact of COVID-19 have been classified as exceptional items.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has made two changes to its disclosures and treatment of APMs compared with those disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year to December 31, 2019:\n\n- -(Loss)/profit after tax before exceptional items - For the year to December 31, 2019, the Group presented exceptional items on the face of the Income statement using a three column approach to reflect the results of the Group on a pre and post exceptional basis to enable users to better understand the performance of the Group. During 2020, following the consideration of regulatory guidance, the Group has re-presented the Income statement to reflect a single column approach. Accordingly, for 2020, exceptional items and the associated narrative have been incorporated into this APM section of the consolidated financial statements. This disclosure has further been disaggregated by reportable operating segment to enable a greater understanding of the performance of each of the reportable operating segments of the Group; and\n- -Pro forma financial information - The Group adopted IFRS 16 'Leases' on January 1, 2019 and applied the modified retrospective transition approach. In doing so, the comparative figures for 2018 were not restated. Accordingly, to provide a consistent basis for comparison with 2019, the Group introduced Pro forma financial information for 2018. As comparative figures for 2018 are no longer required, this pro forma information is no longer required.\n\n## b (Loss)/profit after tax before exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in understanding the entity's financial performance. The exceptional items include: significant discontinuance of hedge accounting; significant restructuring; significant settlement agreements with the Group's pension schemes; significant changes in the long term fleet plans that result in the impairment of fleet assets and the recognition of associated provisions; and, legal settlements.\n\nThe table below reconciles the statutory income statement to the income statement before exceptional items of the Group:\n\n|                                              | Year to December 31 Before  Before   | Year to December 31 Before  Before   | Year to

        "page_content": "The rationale for each exceptional item is given below. In 2020 all items were associated with the impact of COVID-19, except the settlement provision in relation to the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018 (part 4).\n\n## 1 Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac1,756 million represented by an expense of \u20ac62 million relating to revenue foreign currency derivatives, an expense of \u20ac1,781 million relating to fuel derivatives and a credit of \u20ac87 million related to the associated fuel foreign currency derivatives. These amounts relate to the discontinuance of hedge accounting of the associated foreign currency and fuel derivatives on forecast revenue and fuel consumption. These losses have arisen from the substantial deterioration in demand for air travel caused by COVID-19, which has caused a significant level of hedged passenger revenue transactions and fuel purchases in US dollars to no longer be expected to occur based on the Group's operating forecasts prevailing at the Balance sheet date. The Group's risk management strategy has been to build up these hedges gradually over a three-year period when the level of forecast passenger revenue and fuel consumption were higher than current expectations. Accordingly, the hedge accounting for these transactions has been discontinued and the losses recognised in the Income statement. The exceptional charge relating to revenue derivatives and fuel derivatives have been recorded in the Income statement within Passenger revenue and Fuel, oil and emission charges, respectively.\n\nThe related tax credit was \u20ac273 million, with \u20ac11 million being attributable to the charge to Passenger revenue and \u20ac262 million being attributable to Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges.\n\n## 2 Restructuring costs\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac319 million (comprising \u20ac313 million of employee severance pay and \u20ac6 million of associated legal costs) represent the Group-wide restructuring programme, which right-sizes the Group for the near term. While the restructuring programme affects all of the Group's operating companies, the exceptional charges in the year to December 31, 2020 relate to British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and LEVEL only, due to the status of negotiations with employees and their representatives. The exceptional charge has been recorded within Employee costs and Property, IT and other costs.\n\nThe related tax credit was \u20ac53 million.\n\n## 3 Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac108 million includes an inventory write-down expense of \u20ac71 million and a charge relating to contractual lease provisions of \u20ac37 million. The inventory write-down expense represents those expendable inventories that, given the asset impairments, are no longer expected to be utilised. The charge relating to the recognition of contractual lease provisions represents the estimation of the additional cost to fulfil the hand back conditions associated with the leased aircraft that have been permanently stood down and impaired, which are discussed further below. The exceptional charge has been recorded within Engineering and other aircraft costs.\n\nThe related tax credit was \u20ac14 million.\n\n## 4 Settlement provision\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac22 million represents the fine issued by the Information Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom, relating to the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018. The exceptional charge has been recorded within Property, IT and other costs in the Income statement, with a corresponding amount recorded in Provisions.\n\nThere is no tax impact on the recognition of this charge.\n\n## 5 Impairment of fleet and associated assets\n\nThe total exceptional impairment expense of \u20ac856 million is represented by an impairment of fleet assets of \u20ac837 million and an impairment of other assets of \u20ac19 million. The fleet impairment relates to 82 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories that have been stood down permanently and 2 further aircraft which have been impaired down to their recoverable value at December 31, 2020, which includes 32 Boeing 747 aircraft, 23 Airbus A320 aircraft, 15 Airbus A340 aircraft, 4 Airbus A330-200 aircraft, 2 Airbus A318 aircraft, 1 Airbus A321 aircraft, 1 Airbus A319 aircraft, 2 Boeing 777-200 aircraft and 4 Embraer E170 aircraft. Of the fleet impairment, \u20ac676 million is recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac161 million is recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft.\n\nIncluded within the impairment of other assets is an amount of \u20ac15 million relating to the landing rights, classified within Intangible assets, that were held by the operations of LEVEL in Paris. Following the decision to cease the operations of LEVEL in Paris, these landing rights have been recorded at the lower of their carrying value and their recoverable value.\n\nThe exceptional impairment expenses have been recorded within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement.\n\nThe related tax credit was \u20ac123 million.\n\nThe impairment expense has arisen from the substantial deterioration in current and forecast demand for air travel caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has led the Group to re-assess the medium- and long-term capacity and utilisation of the fleet. Subsequent to these impairments, all assets are held at their recoverable amounts.\n\n## 6 Employee benefit obligations\n\nThe exceptional expense of \u20ac672 million recognised in the year to December 31, 2019 related to the past service cost of the Airways Pension Scheme ('APS') settlement agreement described in note 30. This amount arose from the increase in the IAS 19 defined benefit liability of APS following the settlement agreement between the Trustee Directors of APS and British Airways which was approved by the High Court in November 2019. The settlement agreement established higher pensions in payment growth assumptions in future years, resulting in a non-cash increase to the IAS 19 defined benefit liability. The exceptional charge was recorded within Employee costs.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of the post-exceptional to pre-exceptional condensed alternative income statement by operating segment for the years to 31 December 2020 and 2019:\n\nFinancial Statements",

Within non-fuel costs are the costs associated with generating Other revenue, which typically do not represent the costs of transporting passengers or cargo and instead represent the costs of handling and maintenance for other airlines, non-flight products in BA Holidays and costs associated with other miscellaneous non-flight revenue streams. Airline non-fuel costs per ASK is defined as total operating expenditure before exceptional items, less fuel, oil costs and emission charges and less non-flight specific costs divided by total available seat kilometres (ASKs), and is shown on a constant currency basis.\n\n2020\n\nccy\n\n2020\n\n| \u20ac million                                                            | Note   | Reported   | adjustment 1   | ccy     | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Total expenditure on operations                                      | b      | 15,232     | (122)          | 15,110  | 22,893  |\n| Less: exceptional items within expenditure on operations             | b      | 2,999      |                | 2,999   | 672     |\n| Less: fuel, oil costs and emission charges before exceptional  items | b      | 2,041      | (29)           | 2,012   | 6,021   |\n| Non-fuel costs                                                       |        | 10,192     | (93)           | 10,099  | 16,200  |\n| Less: Non-flight specific costs                                      |        | 851        | 1              | 852     | 1,654   |\n| Airline non-fuel costs                                               |        | 9,341      | (94)           | 9,247   | 14,546  |\n| ASKs                                                                 |        | 113,195    |                | 113,195 | 337,754 |\n| Airline non-fuel unit costs per ASK (\u20ac cents)                        |        | 8.25       |                | 8.17    | 4.31    |",

The fleet aspect of property, plant and equipment is inflated over the average age of the fleet to approximate the replacement cost of the associated assets.\n\n| \u20ac million                                                       | Note   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| EBITDA                                                          | f      | (2,266) | 5,396   |\n| Less: Fleet depreciation multiplied by inflation adjustment     |        | (1,921) | (2,040) |\n| Less: Other property, plant and equipment depreciation          |        | (258)   | (259)   |\n| Less: Software intangible amortisation                          |        | (151)   | (131)   |\n|                                                                 |        | (4,596) | 2,966   |\n| Invested capital                                                |        |         |         |\n| Average fleet value 2                                           | 12     | 16,020  | 15,598  |\n| Less: average progress payments 3                               | 12     | (1,117) | (1,297) |\n| Fleet book value less progress payments                         |        | 14,903  | 14,301  |\n| Inflation adjustment 1                                          |        | 1.18    | 1.19    |\n|                                                                 |        | 17,520  | 17,065  |\n| Average net book value of other property, plant and equipment 4 | 12     | 2,329   | 2,448   |\n| Average net book value of software intangible assets 5          | 14     | 652     | 603     |\n| Total invested capital                                          |        | 20,501  | 20,116  |\n| Return on Invested Capital                                      |        | (22.4)% | 14.7 %  |\n\n## h  Results on a constant currency (ccy) basis\n\nMovements in foreign exchange rates impact the Group's financial results. The Group reviews the results, including revenue and operating costs at constant rates of exchange (abbreviated to 'ccy'). The Group calculates these financial measures at constant rates of exchange based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year's results of the Group. Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Group's operating performance on a constant currency basis. Accordingly, the financial measures at constant currency within the discussion of the Group Financial review should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Group financial statements.\n\nThe following table represents the main average and closing exchange rates for the reporting periods. Where 2020 figures are stated at a constant currency basis, they have applied the 2019 rates stated below:\n\n## Foreign exchange rates\n\n|                             |   Average |   Average |   Closing |   Closing |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                             |   2020    |   2019    |   2020    |   2019    |\n| Euro to pound sterling      |      1.13 |      1.13 |      1.1  |      1.18 |\n| US dollar to the euro       |      1.13 |      1.12 |      1.22 |      1.11 |\n| US dollar to pound sterling |      1.27 |      1.27 |      1.35 |      1.31 |",

These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. By their nature, they involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements often use words such as 'expects', 'may', 'will', 'could', 'should', 'intends', 'plans', 'predicts', 'envisages' or 'anticipates' or other words of similar meaning. They include, without limitation, any and all projections relating to the results of operations and financial conditions of International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. and its subsidiary undertakings from time to time (the 'Group'), as well as plans and objectives for future operations, expected future revenues, financing plans, expected expenditure and divestments relating to the Group and discussions of the Group's business plan. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information known to the Group on the date of this report and speak as of the date of this report. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the Group does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nActual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report as a result of any number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties about its impact and duration, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Group, and it is not reasonably possible to itemise each item. Accordingly, readers of this report are cautioned against relying on forwardlooking statements. Further information on the primary risks of the business and the Group's risk management process is set out in the Risk management and principal risk factors section in this report. All forward-looking statements made on or after the date of this report and attributable to IAG are expressly qualified in their entirety by the primary risks set out in that section. Many of these risks are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any further disruption to the global airline industry and economic environment as a result.",
