We are deeply invested in our people, our communities and the planet. We're here to be with our customers today as well as working for a better tomorrow.\n\n## Our values\n\nCare,  Commitment,  Community  and  Confidence. These  values guide the decisions we make and define what it means to be part of Aviva.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nOur strategy is centred on putting the customer first, having a strong social purpose, focusing on where we can win, execution discipline, and ultimately creating value for  our  shareholders.  We  have  three strategic priorities for the Group:\n\n## Focus the portfolio:\n\nOur  focus  is  on  our  Core  markets  in  the  UK,  Ireland  and  Canada. These are our strongest businesses where we have market leading positions. In the UK we are number one in General Insurance and Workplace Pensions and in the top three for Annuities and Equity Release and in Protection and Health. In Ireland we are number two in  General  Insurance  and  in  Canada  we  are  number  three  for  the Property  and  Casualty  market.  These  markets  also  have  extensive customer  franchises  and  can  generate  attractive  financial  returns. Our  international  businesses  in  continental  Europe  and  Asia  are being managed for long-term shareholder value.\n\n## Transform performance:\n\nIn our Core markets we will transform performance to deliver greater customer trust, engagement and retention, and profitable growth for our  shareholders.  We  will  do  this  by  making  it  easier  for  our customers to engage with us, capitalising on the Aviva brand, driving targeted  growth  and  simplifying,  digitising  and  automating  the business.\n\n## Financial strength:\n\nFinancial  strength,  resilience  and  sustainability  underpin  our strategy. Our focus is on maintaining strong solvency and liquidity and reducing debt leverage. This will increase our financial flexibility and provide options for excess capital deployment.\n\nRead more in the 'Our strategy' and 'Our business model' sections.\n\n- R Symbol denotes key performance indicators used as a base to determine or modify remuneration.\n- 1 Group adjusted operating profit is an APM which is used by the Group to supplement the required disclosures under IFRS.

No-one can sensibly argue that a company can create value without looking beyond narrow shareholder interest to recognise the benefits or harms that it contributes to society more widely.\n\n## So how was 2020 for you?\n\nWe've heard 'unprecedented' so many times in recent months, the word has almost lost all meaning. The year was dramatic, certainly. It was also chaotic and traumatic for all of us. COVID-19 and the UK's exit from the EU have shaken what we once took for granted and we are still far from the new normal, whatever that might look like.\n\nAmid the turmoil, it was also a dramatic year for Aviva. The company has a new Chair (me), a new Chief Executive (Amanda), and a new clarity in where we are heading as a business (our new strategy).\n\nOver  my  30-year  career  in  financial  services  I've  often  come  up against Aviva in its various guises. In that time, I saw again and again a company that was a formidable competitor. The paradox is that for too  long  we  have  not  had  the  respect  and  recognition  from  the market that we have from our peers or our customers.\n\nWhere  we  have  at  times  in  the  past  underachieved  and underwhelmed, we have now reset the course. Amanda Blanc, our new CEO, has articulated an ambitious vision built around our three Core markets of the UK, Canada and Ireland. As part of this we aim to become the UK's leading insurer, and the go-to customer brand. And we  have  a  clear  strategy  to  realise  that  vision.  By  focusing  the portfolio, transforming our performance, and ensuring our financial strength, we will unlock Aviva's undoubted potential.\n\nRealising that potential will, of course, depend on delivery. A sensible strategy is only the starting point and Amanda is determined to move at pace to do what we say we will. There is a long way yet to go, but we have made a good start and there are clear  signs  that  we  are heading in the right direction. You can read more about this progress in the following pages.\n\nThe reality is that making the best of Aviva for our people and our shareholders depends on embracing and being proud of what makes Aviva best for our customers. Where others are narrowing their focus, Aviva's key strength and competitive advantage is its unique position to be there for people at whatever stage they are at in life. We can join up the dots to understand and serve our customers better, freeing them  up  to  get  on  with  the  stuff  that  really  counts.  Whether  it  is protecting  what  matters  most  to  people  or  helping  them  shape  a future  they  dream  of,  we  have  the  breadth  and  the  expertise  for whatever they need, wherever, however.\n\nAnd  it  is  by  focusing  on  what  our  customers  need  and  solving problems rather than just selling products that we will live up to our purpose  -  to  be  'with  you  today,  for  a  better  tomorrow'.  It  is important that we can do so, not only for our customers and you, our shareholders,  but  also  to  fulfil  our  wider  responsibilities  to  the communities where we live and work, as well as the wider economy.\n\nIf the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we are ever more closely  connected  in  this  world.  No-one  can  sensibly  argue  that  a company  can  create  value  without  looking  beyond  narrow shareholder  interest  to  recognise  the  benefits  or  harms  that  it contributes to society more widely.\n\nWith  the  challenges  facing  us  all  looking  ever  more  daunting,  not least the climate crisis threatening the viability of our planet, acting in  line  with  a  clearly  defined  purpose  will  be  fundamental  to  long term success. So, too, will be extending our track record as a front runner on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. And success  will  also  depend  on  a  strong  set  of  values  to  guide  our actions, so we have re-articulated what is important to our people to help shape our transformation in the months and years to come.",

We value Commitment, keeping our promises and taking responsibility  for  our  impact  on  the  world.  We  value  Community, understanding that our strength comes from our connection to each other and to those around us. Last but by no means least, we value Confidence. Because we believe that the best is still to come, for our customers, for our communities, and also for Aviva ourselves.\n\nI  want to finish by paying tribute to all my colleagues in Aviva who have been working so hard to support people in such challenging circumstances. In an exceptional year they have been nothing short of exceptional. I thank everyone for their remarkable and continuing efforts and I am frankly both in awe and humbled at what they have achieved. Thank you all so very much.\n\n## So how was 2020 for you?\n\nWell  for  Aviva,  it  has  been  dramatic,  but  amid  everything  we  have lived up to our purpose, helped our customers, and reset the right strategy  for  the  business.  And  now  is  the  time  to  deliver  on  that strategy, so that the market can finally recognise what our customers already know: that to be there for the things that matter most, to build a better future for people and communities, to set the highest standards and lead the sector, it takes Aviva.\n\nGeorge Culmer\n\nChair\n\n3 March 2021\n\n## Our response to COVID-19\n\nIf there was ever any doubt about the importance of our purpose, 2020 provided the answer. Being there for people when it really matters is why we exist, and the past year truly put that to the test.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nOur first priority was looking after our people, so they could continue to serve our customers. Within a month we had moved all but a handful of colleagues out of the office and set everyone up to work from home. We offered flexible working to help anyone juggling caring responsibilities and have given practical support to look after everyone's health and wellbeing, ranging from mindfulness sessions to help for those home schooling, including recycled laptops and an online maths class from our Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Customers\n\nWe recognised the financial and practical challenge of lockdown on both our individual and business customers and did what we could to help them manage. This included free breakdown cover and enhanced home insurance for NHS staff coping at the front line and deferred monthly payments for people experiencing financial difficulties. For businesses, we created advice on managing new risks and offered flexible insurance, so they were still covered even as they adapted to new ways of working.\n\n## Communities\n\nAviva has contributed \u00a343 million to support businesses, health services and community partners in our markets round the world. In the UK we pledged \u00a318.5 million for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) COVID-19 support fund and \u00a35 million to NHS Charities Together, to help fund welfare and well-being for NHS employees, volunteers and patients, and long-term mental health support for NHS workers. Aviva and the Aviva Foundation* also jointly donated \u00a310 million, as part of Aviva's award-winning international partnership with the British Red Cross.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nDespite turmoil in the global economy, Aviva has continued to demonstrate resilience both in terms of financial strength and performance. Nonetheless, the highly uncertain impact on the economy and clear guidance from regulators led us to announce the withdrawal of the 2019 final dividend. We recognise the importance of this dividend, particularly for individual shareholders and did not take the decision lightly. On 6 August 2020 we declared a second interim dividend for 2019 and on 26 November 2020 the board declared an interim dividend of 7.0p per share and an expected final dividend of 14.0p per share. This final dividend was confirmed on 3 March 2021.\n\n- * The Aviva Foundation is administered by Charities Trust under charity registration number 327489.",

Aviva has significant untapped potential, and I am determined to realise it for our shareholders, our customers and our people.\n\n## Overview\n\nBeing there for customers when it really matters is exactly why Aviva exists, and I am incredibly proud of how we have responded in this most  dramatic  of  years.  Our  colleagues  have  been  truly  fantastic, responding  quickly  and  ensuring  that  we  provided  excellent customer service despite the challenges.\n\nI  am pleased to report the strong progress we have made towards our strategic priorities in the short period of time since I became CEO, but  it  is  not  lost  on  me  that  there  is  much  more  to  do.  Aviva  has significant untapped potential, and I am determined to realise it for our shareholders, our customers and our people.\n\nThe 2020 financial performance has been resilient across our Core markets  of  the  UK,  Ireland  and  Canada  with  cash  remittances 1 to Group  of  \u00a31.4  billion.  We  have  delivered  record  results  for  both Savings  &  Retirement  and  bulk  purchase  annuities,  with  strong growth in Commercial General Insurance. We are also making good progress in reducing our expenses though more needs to be done to reach the top quartile efficiency that we strive for.\n\nAll of which resulted in an adjusted operating profit 1 of \u00a32,492 million (2019: \u00a32,558 million), down just 3%, despite the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19, and strong trading across key business growth areas.\n\nIn  line  with  previously  issued  guidance  the  Board  has  proposed  a final dividend of 14 pence per share making a total dividend for the year of 21 pence per share.\n\nWe are  proceeding  with  \u00a31.7  billion  of  debt  reduction  including  a \u00a3800  million  liability  management  exercise.  This  tender  offer together  with  upcoming  maturities  of  debt  instruments  will contribute to a material reduction in debt in the first half of 2021, consistent with our target of delivering a sub-30% Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 once we have completed our major divestments. This is an important first step in executing against our capital framework.\n\nWe are also announcing new financial targets that demonstrate our confidence in delivering profitable growth across our Core markets. We are targeting to deliver over \u00a35 billion of cash remittances 1 over the next three years and to grow cash remittances 1 to \u00a31.8 billion in 2023. Combined with reduced centre debt interest and other costs we will  deliver  strong  growth  in  excess  cashflows  to  fund  growing returns to shareholders and sustainable investment in our business.\n\n## Customers\n\nAviva has 18 million customers across our Core markets and we are placing them at the heart of everything that we do - our customers are  why  we  exist,  and  it  is  essential  that  we  serve  their  needs seamlessly and efficiently, whether they be an individual, a business or an intermediary. I recognise that the insurance industry has all too often made the customer experience more difficult and complicated than it  needs  to  be.  Well,  what  do  our  customers  want  from  their insurer?  They  want  fair  prices,  a  trusted  brand  that  delivers  on  its promises, excellent service and all from a company that will act in a sustainable  and  responsible  way.  Aviva  understands  these  needs and  importantly,  is  responding  to  them.  And  by  meeting  our customers' expectations, we will live up to our purpose to be 'With you today, for a better tomorrow' .\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn 2020 we announced three clear strategic priorities for Aviva: focus the portfolio, transform performance and financial strength.\n\n- 1 This is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) which provides useful information to enhance the understanding of our financial performance.

Focus the portfolio\n\nWe are focusing on our strongest and most strategically advantaged businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada including Aviva Investors. These  are  our  Core  markets,  where  we  have  market  leading positions,  can  generate  attractive  returns,  have  a  strong  brand, deliver incredible customer service and where we have a clear path to win. Across these markets we are investing for growth.\n\nOur businesses in continental Europe and Asia are being managed for  long  term  shareholder  value.  During  2020,  we  completed  the disposals  of  Friends  Provident  International  Limited,  our  majority shareholding in Aviva Singapore, and our share in joint ventures in Indonesia and Hong Kong.\n\nWe have also announced the sales of our French business, our Italian operations  (including  Aviva  Vita  announced  in  November),  our minority shareholding in Turkey, and our entire business in Vietnam, which we expect to complete later in 2021. We are also exploring our strategic options in Poland and our other international joint ventures.\n\nIn 2020 we built on our existing commitment as a Living Wage employer by becoming one of the first accredited Living Hours employers in the UK, offering predictable shifts and guaranteed minimum hours to give people greater certainty and financial security.\n\nFor those with caring responsibilities we give the option of 35 hours paid leave each year and over 600 people used the scheme in 2020. For new parents, regardless of gender, we offer up to 12 months leave in the UK, including 26 weeks at full pay. 97% of new dads at Aviva have taken more than two weeks leave, with the average being five months with their new arrivals.\n\nWe introduced a mid-life MOT for employees to help those in the middle of their careers consider and plan for their wealth, work and well-being needs. We also launched new support and training around domestic abuse helping employees to identify the signs and offer best practice responses and guidance to customers and colleagues.\n\nIn 2020 the death of George Floyd and the #BlackLivesMatter campaign also received prominent attention at Aviva. In September, we published our BlackLivesMatter action plan and committed to change by supporting colleagues, educating our people and doing more to act for change in the wider community.",

This year we continued our work to create more renewable energy capacity, opening one of the UK's largest combined solar carport and energy storage at our offices in Perth.\n\nIn the UK we set a new 2050 net-zero emissions target for our auto-enrolment default pension funds, giving more of our customers the opportunity to invest their pensions towards building a world they would like to retire into. We also called on the UK government to legislate for other default pension funds to follow suit.\n\nAviva Investors continued to build on their strong heritage of responsible investing, targeting \u00a310 billion of investments into UK infrastructure and real estate projects and engaging with the companies we invest in to promote a transition to a low-carbon future.\n\nIf we are going to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, it's going to take bold actions and real leadership. Aviva has been leading the insurance industry for over 300 years, and we are determined to continue doing so today and tomorrow.\n\n## 2.  Transform performance\n\nAviva  has  market  leading  positions  and  exceptional  relationships with  customers  and  intermediaries  but  to  date  has  not  translated these into superior financial performance.\n\nWe  have  a  clear  focus  on  correcting  this  by  transforming  the performance  of  our  Core  markets.  This  will  be  achieved  through targeted growth, where we have leading market positions, accelerating our simplification, digitisation and automation and delivering higher levels of customer engagement through digital platforms.\n\nWe  have  reinvigorated  our  executive  leadership  team  with  seven appointments including new CEOs for UK & Ireland Life and Aviva Investors.  We  have  made  good  progress  in  embedding  a  strong performance  culture by overhauling individual performance management,  setting  clear  expectations  for  our  leaders  and emphasising the importance of close collaboration.\n\nIn  March  2021,  we  have  launched  a  new  sustainability  ambition, leveraging  our  existing  strengths  in  Environmental,  Social  and Governance ('ESG'). We want Aviva to be recognised as a business that leads by example through products and services that are good for society as a whole and by influencing others to act.\n\nWe have set ourselves clear goals to fight climate change including becoming the first major insurance company in the world to target achieving Net Zero carbon emission status by 2040.

Our Solvency II  shareholder  cover  ratio 1 of  202% (2019:  206%) has remained  resilient  throughout  a  turbulent  year  bolstered  by Solvency II operating capital generation 1 from our Core markets and benefits from disposals of our Manage-for-value markets.\n\nThese  were  partly  offset  by  foreign  exchange,  market  movements and modelling changes. Our centre liquidity 1 of \u00a34.1 billion, as at the end  of  February  2021 (2019:  End  of  February  2020  \u00a32.4  billion) ,  is similarly  strong  having  benefitted  from  cash  remittances 1 and disposal proceeds.\n\nAs we have outlined in our capital framework we intend to reduce our Solvency  II  debt  leverage  ratio 1 below  30%  and  once  we  have completed the reshaping of our portfolio, we expect to deploy excess capital  through  investing  for  growth  across  our  Core  markets  and returns to shareholders.\n\nWe intend to grow our dividend per share by low to mid-single digits over time as we grow across our Core markets, improve efficiency, reduce debt levels and associated interest costs.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAviva  has  responded  incredibly  well  to  the  challenges  in  2020 presented by COVID-19 and Brexit. Our Core markets have proven to be resilient and our customer service has remained high.\n\nWhile the broader economic outlook remains uncertain, it is positive to see progress being made with the global vaccination effort and the economy adapting to social distancing measures.\n\nOur new financial targets demonstrate our confidence in our Core markets being well positioned to grow. We will continue to deliver against our capital framework and will provide updates on our plans for  future  deployments  of  excess  capital  as  we  make  progress  in completing our announced disposals.\n\n## Amanda Blanc\n\nChief Executive Officer 3 March 2021",

Despite  the  grounds  for  hope  offered  by  vaccination programmes, governments are still engaged in a careful balancing act between containing the spread of the virus and limiting damage to the economy and society from those containment measures. As well as the human cost, the situation has led to widespread economic harm across many  sectors  and  a  significant  impact  on  health  services.  It  has  also substantially accelerated a number of existing megatrends.\n\nWe have developed our strategy in the context of political, economic and regulatory forces as well as the broader megatrends affecting us all.  We acknowledge the risks and challenges these trends present and aim to turn them into opportunities for growth.\n\nWe see the following issues as the key factors affecting our external environment:\n\n## Political and macroeconomic impact\n\nPolitical and macroeconomic factors impact the operating environment of our businesses in the UK and abroad. These include the COVID-19 driven economic downturn and high debt levels, low interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, e.g. between the US and China. The UK also faces economic headwinds resulting from the end of the 'Brexit transition period' and a new trading relationship with the European Union (EU).\n\n## Active governments and regulators\n\nGovernments are increasingly promoting private provision and reforming services once funded by the state (e.g. pensions and healthcare). While regulators remain focused on customer outcomes, enforcing conduct and prudential supervision (e.g. Financial Conduct Authority pricing review) as well as standardising insurance accounting (e.g. IFRS 17), there is significant work underway to reform the UK regulatory framework following the UK's exit from the EU.\n\nRead more about our risk management in the\n\n-3.5%\n\nIn 2020, global GDP contracted severely\n\n(estimation)\n\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook Update, January 2021\n\nPercentage of UK employees who were members of a workplace pension scheme in 2019 (up from 47% in 2012 when auto-enrolment began)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n77%\n\nSource: ONS, March 2020\n\n'Risk and risk management' section of this Strategic report.\n\n## Ageing\n\nAcross the world, populations are ageing due to better standards of living, improvements in medical science, and declining fertility rates. This is putting traditional retirement models under pressure and creating challenges and opportunities around funding and care in later life.\n\n## Health & Wellbeing\n\nTraditional healthcare models are under strain from rising prevalence of chronic conditions, ageing populations, high costs of new treatments and the challenges posed to health systems by COVID-19 (from the disease itself, including long term effects experienced by some people, as well as mental health impacts of containment measures and delays in diagnosis and treatment of other conditions). Driven by technological advances and accelerated by COVID-19 and increased health awareness, new models are developing with a focus on prevention, early intervention and digital technology.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events, leading to increased political focus and regulation, as well as growing consumer awareness of the economic and social consequences of climate change, and the impact of their saving and investment decisions.\n\n## Mobility\n\nTransport is shifting from private ownership towards more efficient, safer and cleaner modes: car-sharing, electric fleets, efficient public transport and self-driving vehicles. COVID-19 has also triggered significant shifts in behaviour which are likely to have a lasting impact on mobility (e.g. home working, reduced business and leisure travel).\n\n## Big Data and AI\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is unlocking the value of Big Data and bringing new levels of efficiency and productivity. It also presents new challenges around the ethical use of data, for example in the use of algorithms for decision making, or COVID-19 track and trace systems that use location data.\n\n## Convenience\n\nPowered by new technologies, a new level of convenience is emerging where consumers' personal needs are fulfilled instantly, and even anticipated. COVID-19 has significantly accelerated the existing shift to online in all sectors.\n\n## New risks\n\nNew risks are emerging as a result of technological advances and behavioural changes such as the use of personal data and sharing of information, the need for uninterrupted access to services, and the demise of traditional jobs, as well as development of new skills and capabilities. This creates a need for new saving, retirement and insurance solutions.\n\nGlobal population aged 65 or over in 2019 (projected to double by 2050)\n\n703 million\n\nSource: UN World Population Ageing, 2019\n\nEstimated number of people with diabetes in the UK (diagnosed and non-diagnosed)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.8 million\n\nSource: Diabetes UK, February 2020\n\nAssets in sustainable funds at 31 December 2020 (a record high)\n\n$1.65 trillion\n\nSource: Morningstar, January 2021\n\nGrowth in UK public electric vehicle charging points 2015 - 2020\n\n466%\n\nSource: UK Department for Transport, February 2021\n\nRespondents reporting that their companies have adopted AI in at least one business function\n\n50%\n\nSource: McKinsey Global AI Survey, November 2020\n\nAnnual growth in online retail sales (UK, 2019-2020)\n\n46%\n\nSource: ONS, January 2021\n\nPercentage increase in the number of data breaches globally in 2019 vs. 2018\n\nc.33%\n\nSource: Munich Re, April 2020",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\n## Our purpose\n\n## With you today, for a better tomorrow\n\nSince  1696,  we  have  been  there  for  our  customers  when  it  really matters. We are here to help them make the most of life and know that  if  things  go  wrong,  we  will  be  with  them  to  put  it  right.  Our purpose inspires us to do the right thing. It reflects that we are deeply invested  in  our  customers,  our  communities,  our  people,  our shareholders and our planet.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nOur strategy is centred on putting the customer first, having a strong social purpose, focusing on where we can win, execution discipline, and ultimately creating value for our shareholders.\n\nWe have three strategic priorities for the Group:\n\n- \u221e Focus the portfolio;\n- \u221e Transform performance; and\n- \u221e Financial strength.\n\n## Focus the portfolio\n\nOur  focus  is  on  our  Core  markets  in  the  UK,  Ireland  and  Canada. These are our strongest businesses where we have market leading positions, extensive customer franchises and can generate attractive financial returns.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the disposals of a majority shareholding in  Aviva  Singapore,  a  majority  shareholding  in  Friends  Provident International Limited (FPI), and our joint ventures in Indonesia and Hong  Kong.  We  also  announced  the  disposals  of  our  Italian  joint venture, Aviva Vita, and our entire business in Vietnam. In 2021, we announced the disposals of our entire business in France, our joint venture  in  Turkey  and  the  remaining  Life  and  General  Insurance business in Italy.\n\nOur  remaining  international  businesses  will  be  managed  for  long term shareholder value. We will build on the good work our teams are  doing  to  grow  and  optimise  these  businesses,  but  where  we cannot  meet  our  strategic  objectives,  we  will  be  decisive  and withdraw capital. Ultimately there may be better owners for these businesses than Aviva.\n\n## Transform performance\n\nWe  will  transform  performance  across  our  Core  markets  to strengthen  our  competitive  position  and  ensure  we  can  take advantage  of  emerging  growth  opportunities.  With  top  3  market positions across the majority of our businesses, we are building on strong  foundations.  The  growth  opportunities  we  will  target  are driven by trends such as an ageing population, a heightened focus on  health  and  wellbeing,  and  the  emergence  of  new  risks  for  our customers, amongst others.\n\nWe will transform performance by making it easier for our customers to  engage  with  us,  capitalising  on  the  Aviva  brand,  simplifying, digitising and automating the business and driving targeted growth. We  believe  that  doing  this  will  deliver  greater  customer  trust, engagement and retention, in addition to improved cost efficiency and business agility. Ultimately this should then result in profitable growth and sustainable value creation for our shareholders.\n\nBuilding a consistent, digitally led customer experience is critical to how we can enhance customer engagement and retention. We will do this by further developing our digital platforms to make it easier for our customers to access the full suite of Aviva products. We will also connect the rich data we collect from across our businesses to ensure we can offer our customers the right products and services at the right time.\n\nAligned  to  our  strong  social  purpose,  we  have  increased  our sustainability  ambition  on  tackling  climate  change  and  building  a stronger Britain. As part of this ambition, we have announced our plan to be carbon Net Zero by 2040 and to invest \u00a310 billion into UK infrastructure and real estate over the next three years. We will also ensure  we  maintain  high  standards  on  running  our  business sustainably  and  embed  this  in  our  governance,  decision  making, reporting, and stakeholder engagement.\n\nRead more about how we are transforming performance across our Core  markets  in  the  'Our  market  review'  section  of  the  Strategic report.  Read  more  about  our  approach  to  sustainability  in  the 'Corporate responsibility' section of the Strategic report.\n\n## Financial strength\n\nFinancial  strength,  resilience  and  sustainability  underpin  our strategy.  Our  focus  here  is  on  maintaining  strong  solvency  and liquidity and reducing debt. This will increase our financial flexibility and provide options for excess capital deployment, our priorities for which are:\n\n- \u221e Debt reduction to achieve a Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 below 30%;\n- \u221e Returns to shareholders when our Solvency II shareholder cover ratio 1 is above 180%, the upper end of our working range; and\n- \u221e Investment  in  our  Core  markets  where  we  see  attractive opportunities to do so.\n\nAs  we  focus  the  portfolio,  we  expect  our  Solvency  II  shareholder cover ratio 1 to remain above our target working range.\n\nOur dividend policy will deliver a sustainable and resilient ordinary dividend, covered by the capital generation, cash remittances and growth from our Core markets in the UK, Ireland and Canada. We expect to grow our ordinary dividends per share in the low-to-mid single  digits.  Future  growth  in  the  dividend  will  be  driven  by  the transformed performance and growth of our businesses, by lower levels of debt and from the benefits of focusing the portfolio.\n\n## Our values\n\nWe have redefined our values to help us to deliver our ambitions. Developed with our employees, they will guide the decisions we take. Aligned to our purpose and strategy, they define what it means to be part of Aviva. Our new values are Care, Commitment, Community and Confidence, see the 'Our values' section for more detail.",

The  vast  majority  of  these, \u00a31,359  million (2019:  \u00a31,909  million  including  \u00a3500  million  special dividend  from  UK  Life) came  from  our  Core  markets.  Remittances from Manage-for-value businesses were \u00a3127 million (2019: \u00a3613 million) due  to  regulatory restrictions and our cautious approach given the continuing economic and market uncertainty.\n\n## Profits\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit 2 of \u00a33,161 million (2019: \u00a33,184 million) and operating earnings per share 1,3 of 60.8 pence (2019: 60.5 pence) were stable. IFRS profit for the year was \u00a32,910 million (2019:  2,663  million) while  basic  earnings  per  share increased to 70.2p (2019: 63.8p) . Adjusted operating profit 2 from Core markets was resilient at \u00a32,492 million (2019: \u00a32,558 million).\n\nGroup  adjusted  operating  profit 2 remained  resilient  despite  the negative  impacts  of  COVID-19  as  we  delivered  strong  results  in general  insurance,  bulk  annuities,  as  well  as  our  savings  and retirement  propositions,  with  lower  profits  from  our  Heritage business  reflecting  its  gradual  run-off.  Our  Manage-for-value operations also performed well on an IFRS basis. The main impact of COVID-19  was  felt  in  general  insurance  where  the  total  estimated impact amounted to a loss of \u00a317 million. Within our Core general insurance markets, the impact was greater at \u00a384 million, as business interruption  claims  net  of  reinsurance  were  only  partly  offset  by favourable impacts of reduced economic activity in other product lines tempered by higher profit-contingent commission payments to distributors.\n\n## Cost reductions\n\nOur approach to efficiency initiatives was also brought into focus as a result of COVID-19. Although some costs were reduced, for example travel, we incurred incremental expenditure including the IT spend required  to  allow  all  of  our  employees  to  work  remotely.  We  also contributed  \u00a343  million  to  community  support  initiatives.  Despite these  headwinds  we  have  delivered  \u00a3180  million  of  cumulative savings since 2018. We remain on track to reduce controllable costs 1 by \u00a3300 million by 2022 and will deliver this solely from Core markets.\n\n## Solvency II operating capital generation (OCG) 1\n\nSolvency II  OCG 1 decreased to \u00a31,932 million (2019: \u00a32,259 million) while  Solvency  II  OCG 1 excluding  the  impact  of  capital  actions, non-economic assumption changes and other non-recurring items, was stable at \u00a31,414 million (2019: \u00a31,433 million) .  Total Solvency II OCG 1 was impacted by changes made to our French life model which corrected  a  mis-applied  rule,  partly  mitigated  by  an  increase  in offsetting  Group  diversification  benefits,  as  well  as  a  positive contribution from management actions of \u00a3518 million (2019: \u00a3826 million). This  included  positive  impact  of  assumption changes (including longevity releases) albeit lower than in 2019.\n\nSolvency II OCG 1 from Core markets increased 5% to \u00a31,948 million (2019:  \u00a31,850  million) driven  by  a  strong  performance  in  general insurance.\n\n## Solvency II return on equity (RoE) 1\n\nSolvency  II  RoE 1 was  9.8% (2019:  14.3%) ,  lower  primarily  owing  to changes to modelling in our French life business which corrected a mis-applied  rule,  and  significantly  lower  benefit  from  longevity assumption changes in UK Life. Underlying performance, excluding the  impact  of  capital  actions,  non-economic  assumption  changes and other non-recurring items, Solvency II RoE 1 increased to 9.8% (2019: 8.1%) driven  by  underlying  improvements in UK Life, due to bulk  purchase  annuities  (BPA)  new  business,  and  in  our  UK  and Canada General Insurance businesses.\n\n## Capital and cash Centre liquidity 1\n\nAt end February 2021, centre liquidity 1 was \u00a34.1 billion (February 2020: \u00a32.4 billion) with the increase primarily driven by the receipt  of  disposal  proceeds  for  our  Singapore,  Hong  Kong, Indonesia  and  FPI  businesses,  partially  offset  by  payment  of dividends.\n\n## Solvency II debt leverage\n\nSolvency II debt leverage ratio 1 remained at 31% in 2020 (2019: 31%) , with  an  increase  in  total  debt  offset  by  an  increase  in  own  funds. During  the  first  half  of  2020,  Aviva  issued  \u00a3500 million  of  tier  2 subordinated  debt  in  advance  of  redeeming  \u00a3500  million  of restricted  tier  1  securities  in  July.  In  October  2020,  we  issued C$450 million of tier 2 subordinated debt pre-financing a C$450 million instrument maturing in May 2021. With high levels of centre liquidity 1 held  at  Group  centre  we  reduced our commercial paper in issue by \u00a3130 million over 2020.\n\nThe  Board  approved,  on  3  March  2021,  an  \u00a3800  million  liability management exercise. This tender offer, alongside upcoming debt maturities and optional first calls in the first half of 2021, allows us to reduce our Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 by c.4 percentage points by half year 2021.\n\n## Solvency II capital\n\nAt  31  December  2020,  Aviva's  Solvency  II  shareholder  surplus  was \u00a313.0  billion  and  Solvency  II  shareholder  cover  ratio 1 was  202% (2019: \u00a312.6 billion and 206% respectively) . Solvency II net asset value per  share 1 was  442  pence (2019:  423  pence) .  Solvency  II  OCG 1 of \u00a31,932  million  ( 2019:  \u00a32,259  million) and  the  benefits  of  disposals were  offset  by  capital  market  movements  driven  mainly  by  the impact of the reduction in interest rates over the course of the year and the payment of dividends in the period.\n\n## Corporate credit rating migration and commercial mortgage portfolio\n\nDuring 2020, we experienced no defaults, only c.\u00a360 million of the bonds  were  downgraded  in  our  shareholder  portfolio  below investment  grade  and  less  than  c.13%  of  the  portfolio  had  been downgraded to a lower letter.\n\nOur  commercial  mortgage  portfolio  continues  to  perform  as expected. The average loan to value (LTV) ratio across the portfolio remains low at 61% (2019:  56%) ,  loans  in  arrears  were  \u00a334  million (2019: nil) , equivalent to 0.5% of the portfolio, and the loan interest cover ratio was 2.74x (2019: 2.90x) .",

        "page_content": "## Dividends and capital framework\n\nOn 26 November 2020, Aviva announced a new dividend policy and capital framework that align with the Group's strategic priorities. We aim  to  deliver  a  sustainable  pay-out  ratio  and  grow  dividend  per share by low to mid-single digits. Under our capital framework, we expect  to  return  to  shareholders  excess  capital  above  180% Solvency II shareholder cover ratio 1 after allowing for investment in the business and once our Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 has been reduced below 30% and we have completed our major divestments.\n\nIn light of our 2020 performance and strong capital and liquidity, the Board  has  proposed  a  final  dividend  of  14  pence  per  share (2019: nil), bringing the total dividend in respect of 2020 financial year to 21 pence per share (2019: 15.5 pence per share) . A second interim dividend in respect of 2019 financial year of 6 pence per share was paid in the third quarter of 2020.\n\n## Business highlights and growth opportunities\n\n## UK and Ireland\n\nWe  have  a  vision  to  grow  our  business  in  the  UK.  Our  strategy focusses  on  achieving  top  quartile  competitiveness  in  our  home market in savings and retirement, general as well as life insurance, protection  and  health.  To  do  this,  we  will  transform  operational efficiency through  simplification and  automation,  improving customer experience, accelerating data, analytics and underwriting capabilities, and building stronger investments capabilities. We will also build cross-UK customer capabilities, make better use of digital tools, and innovate more effectively to make it easier for customers and intermediaries to deal with us.\n\nIn 2020, UK and Ireland Life adjusted operating profit 2 decreased 3% to \u00a31,907 million (2019: \u00a31,974 million) with strong performances in bulk purchase annuities and Savings & Retirement and a positive but lower benefit of assumption changes offset by COVID-19 impact on new business sales 3 of equity release and individual protection.\n\nIn  UK  Life  and  Ireland,  Solvency  II  return  on  capital 1 fell  to  7.4% (2019: 9.1%) as  result  of  positive  but  lower  longevity  assumption benefits compared with 2019, partially offset by increased levels of BPAs and improved longevity experience. Solvency II OCG 1 increased to \u00a31,259 million ( 2019: \u00a31,248 million) benefitting from management actions taken to optimise capital and a stable new business strain despite a significant increase in BPA sales 3 .\n\n## Savings & Retirement\n\nNet flows 1 increased by 14% to \u00a38.5 billion (2019: \u00a37.5 billion) with higher  net  flows 1 across  Workplace  and  our  Platform  business. Adjusted operating profit 2 increased to \u00a3119 million (2019: \u00a388 million) driven  by  higher  revenues  driven  from  an increased asset base, with assets under management (AUM) 1 up 13% over 2020 to \u00a3128 billion (2019: \u00a3113 billion).\n\nWorkplace savings - Aviva is the number one 4 provider of bundled Workplace  pensions  in  the  UK  serving  3.8  million  customers  with assets of \u00a381 billion (representing an average annual growth of 12% over the last four years) and net flows 1 of  \u00a35.3  billion  in  2020.  The savings and retirement market represents an enormous opportunity for  Aviva  in  the  UK.  The  shift  to  defined  contribution (DC) pension saving as individuals are increasingly having to take responsibility for their  financial  futures  as  well  as  regulatory  changes  such  as  the introduction of auto enrolment mean that the DC workplace pension market is expected to grow from \u00a3390 billion in 2020 to more than \u00a3950 billion in 2028 5 .\n\nAdviser platform - In a short space of time we have built up assets of \u00a332 billion and were ranked top two 6 by net flows 1 in 2020 with a market share of 14% of net flows 1 .  The complexity and flexibility of the UK pension and savings system as well as the ageing population, which  includes  wealthy  baby  boomers  reaching  retirement,  has accelerated the need for financial advice and for platform solutions that  help  financial  advisers  to  look  after  their  clients'  assets  more effectively  and  efficiently.  This  has  driven  growth  in  the  adviser platform market from \u00a3400 billion in 2015 to over \u00a3750 billion in 2020 with forecast market growth to \u00a31.3 trillion by 2025 7 .\n\n## Annuities & Equity Release\n\nSales 3 rose 21% to \u00a37.5 billion (2019: \u00a36.2 billion) while value of new business (VNB) 1 increased 25% to \u00a3356 million (2019: \u00a3284 million), reflecting strong growth in our BPA business partly offset by lower sales of individual annuities and equity release. Adjusted operating profit 2 was 6% lower at \u00a3815 million (2019: \u00a3866 million) as growth in BPA  business  but  lower  profits  in  individual  annuities  and  equity release.\n\nBulk Purchase Annuities - In 2020, we were ranked in the top four 8 bulk  purchase  annuity  providers  with  sales 3 growing  by  48%  to \u00a36.0 billion (2019:  \u00a34.0  billion) with  the  overall  Annuity  &  Equity release book increasing AUM 1 by 11% to \u00a375 billion (2019: \u00a367 billion) . The  demand  from  businesses  and  defined  benefit  pension  fund trustees  for  annuities  has  continued  to  increase  with  the  market growing from \u00a313 billion in 2015 to greater than \u00a330 billion in 2020 9 . This demand has been driven by the desire of corporates to de-risk their  exposure  to  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  through  the bulk purchase of annuities from insurance companies. At \u00a32 trillion, the total value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities in the UK is very high and is expected to result in a high level of demand for bulk annuities estimated to be \u00a330 billion to \u00a350 billion per annum 9 across  the  entire  market  over  the  next  five  years.  Aviva's  financial strength  as  well  as  expertise  to  both  price  annuity  business effectively  and  through  Aviva  Investors  to  invest  profitably  for  the long-term  means  we  are  well  placed  to  further  succeed  in  this growing market.\n\n- 1 This is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) which provides useful information to enhance the understanding of our financial performance.

Following  the introduction  of  pension  freedoms  in  2015  (which  gave  individuals greater  choice  in  how  they  access  their  savings  in  retirement)  the demand  for  individual  annuities  in  the  UK  has  fallen  significantly, nevertheless, we expect individual annuities to remain an important option for customers when securing income in retirement.\n\nEquity Release - In 2020 we maintained our number three 3 position in equity release mortgages with sales 2 of \u00a3562 million (2019: \u00a3780 million) . Volumes were impacted by our ability to conduct in-person property valuations owing to lockdowns, nevertheless with \u00a33 trillion of housing equity owned by over 55s, we expect demand for equity release mortgages to continue to grow into the future. With strong  growth  in  property  values  over  the  last  two  decades, unlocking the significant value locked up in their homes is a way for many to achieve financial security in later life.\n\n## Protection & Health\n\nSales 2 were in line with prior year at \u00a32.4 billion (2019: \u00a32.4 billion) as record sales 2 of group protection, up 38% to \u00a30.7 billion, were offset by a reduction in individual protection sales 2 . VNB 4 from Protection &  Health  was  stable  at  \u00a3167  million (2019:  \u00a3168  million) .  Adjusted operating profit 5 was 6% lower at \u00a3189 million (2019: \u00a3201 million) as competition  impacted  both  margin  and  volumes  in  individual protection,  partly  offset  by  an  improvement  in  group  protection which benefited from improved claims experience.\n\n- 1 ABI - 12 months to end Q320.\n- 2 Reference to sales represents present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) which is an APM, further details can be found in the 'Other Information' section within the Annual Report and Accounts. 3 Aviva analysis of public company disclosures.\n- 4 This is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) which provides useful information to enhance the understanding of our financial performance.

We live in the same streets and work in the same towns. We recognise the strength that comes from our connection to one another and are deeply invested in our communities.\n\nAs a multinational company and one of the UK's largest companies we play an important part in the economies and societies in which we operate through the taxes we pay. In 2019 we were the 8 th largest corporate contributor of tax in the UK and in 2020 we paid \u00a31,052 million in corporate income taxes globally, including \u00a3779 million in the UK.\n\nOn top of our donations given specifically to help people cope with the impact of COVID-19 this year, we also committed \u00a311.5 million to other local projects, making total community investment \u00a354.5 million in 2020. Overall, this has helped 5.1 million people, from keeping them active and looking after the environment, to tackling loneliness and teaching new skills.\n\nThe Aviva Community Fund continued in France, Italy and Ireland and we officially launched the new look Aviva Community Fund in the UK. In partnership with Crowdfunder UK, this gives our people the chance to choose projects they wish to support. In Canada, Aviva's Take Back Our Roads campaign continued to focus on improving road safety across the country.\n\nAs well as looking after our customers, our people continue to play a vital role in community activity, fully demonstrating one of Aviva's values: Care. Everyone is entitled to paid volunteer leave and despite the restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19, in total our people globally have given more than 29,200 volunteering hours to help others this year.\n\nIn the UK, the Aviva Foundation* continued to invest unclaimed assets of shareholders through grants to charities and social enterprises. In 2020 the Foundation committed over \u00a34 million to 10 non-profit organisations and social enterprises that can help our communities and vulnerable customers. This included funding the Financially Resilient Communities Programme, a consortium of local and national charities, working with communities to improve financial advice available for deprived communities.\n\n- * The Aviva Foundation is administered by Charities Trust under charity registration number 327489.",

        "page_content": "Chief Financial Officer's report continued\n\nProtection - We are a leading provider of both group and individual protection  ranking  second 1 in  each  category.  In  2020,  our  group protection  business  had  a  record  year  with  sales 2 of  \u00a3716  million (2019: \u00a3518 million) , however our individual protection business saw lower sales 2 of \u00a31,210 million (2019: 1,357 million) owing to the impact of lockdown measures on the housing market and key distributors including advisors, banks and estate agents. The protection market tends to grow in line with or slightly above inflation which provides a steady and high-quality source of earnings for Aviva. Our key sources of  competitive  advantage  include  our  brand,  digital  propositions, underwriting  discipline,  and  our  relationships  with  intermediaries. We have invested in these businesses to drive future growth, while also maintaining our focus on efficiency.\n\nHealth - While we are the number 3 player 3 in health insurance, we are  the  only  provider  of  scale  that  can  offer  individual  and  group protection  products,  making  our  health  offering  not  only  a standalone  but  also  complementary  proposition.  2020  has illustrated the importance of health and wellbeing to individuals, but also to companies and their employees. Our digital offering, where 99%  of  interactions  with  health  brokers  are  carried  out  digitally, positions us well in this increasingly important market. In 2020 we increased sales 1 by 1% to \u00a3513 million (2019: \u00a3507 million) .\n\n## General Insurance\n\nUK, Ireland and Canada net written premiums (NWP) was stable year on year at \u00a37.7 billion (2019: \u00a37.7 billion) with strong commercial lines growth offsetting lower personal lines premiums. Adjusted operating profit 4 increased by 3% 9 to \u00a3500 million (2019: \u00a3488 million) as strong improvements in underlying performance were partially offset by the negative impacts of \u00a384 million of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower  long  term  investment  return  (LTIR).  LTIR  declined  to \u00a3274 million  ( 2019:  \u00a3314  million) representing  an  average  return  of 2.3% (2019: 2.8%) due to lower interest rates and de-risking activity in light of the market volatility in 2020.\n\nCore  markets  general  insurance  combined  operating  ratio  (COR) 5 improved by 0.9 percentage points to 96.8% (2019:  97.7%) .  Strong underlying performance across our Core markets was partially offset by the net negative impacts of COVID-19, which had 1.1 percentage points adverse impact on COR 5 , and lower benefits from weather and prior  year  development,  which  had  3.2  percentage  points  adverse impact on COR 5 compared to 2019.\n\nUK Personal Lines - Our personal lines business has market leading digital propositions which are driving high customer advocacy. NWP was 7% lower in 2020 at \u00a32,232 million (2019: 2,399 million) reflecting the impact of lockdowns and disruption caused by COVID-19 on the branch networks of our distribution partners as well as rationalisation of unprofitable business lines.\n\nWe currently  have  around  10%  market  share 6 benefiting  from  the strength  of  the  Aviva  brand,  strong  distribution  relationships, including with some of the UK's largest high street banks, as well as market  leading  reputation  with  brokers.  Until  recently  only  our Quote-me-happy  and  General  Accident  brands  were  available through price comparison websites (PCWs) however in late 2020 we launched our Aviva brand's motor offering on the major PCWs, with good early signs of success, and our home offering has followed.\n\nUK Commercial Lines -  We are the largest commercial insurer 7 in the  UK  with  11%  market  share.  Our  digitally  transacted  channels continue to perform exceptionally, while a favourable underwriting environment and strong retention rates have helped us to grow NWP in 2020 by 10% to \u00a32,008 million (2019: \u00a31,819 million). We focus on the small or medium-sized enterprises (SME) and the fast-growing Global Corporate and Specialty (GCS) markets. We expect growth to continue  as  we  address  under-insurance  amongst  SMEs  and innovate and invest in our GCS offering to meet client demand for protection against emerging risks. Our success has been driven by a focus on exceptional service and a reputation as a trusted partner. This was evidenced by an increase in broker trust to 95% in contrast to  the  wider  market  -  a  really  important  measure  given  the disruption  caused  by  the  global  pandemic  and  the  pivotal  role brokers play in distributing commercial lines products in the UK.\n\nCanada Personal Lines - We are a top 3 8 insurer in Canada with NWP in 2020 of \u00a32,075 million (2019: \u00a32,100 million) reflecting the impact of the pandemic on our distribution partners as well as customer relief measures. The Canadian market is largely intermediated therefore we  serve  our  customers  mostly  through  brokers  and  through  our partner, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the most recognised financial services brand in Canada. We are continuing to invest in automation and are looking to improve our digital offering, leveraging the wider Group's expertise, as demand for digital products slowly increases in this more traditional insurance market.\n\nCanada Commercial Lines - We are a leading commercial insurer in Canada with NWP in 2020 up 7% 9 to \u00a31,021 million (2019: \u00a3961 million) as we benefit from a rate hardening environment reflecting reduced capacity and sustained historical under-pricing across the market. In common with the UK, our Canadian commercial lines business  is distributed largely through intermediaries and focuses on the SME and  GCS  markets.  We  strive  to  offer  best-in-class  service  and customer value underpinned by pricing sophistication to help drive even better retention and profitability in the future.\n\n## Aviva Investors\n\nOur asset management business, Aviva Investors has \u00a3366 billion of assets  under  management 5 and  has  an  ambition  to  become  the global  leader  in  active  sustainable  investment  outcomes.  This includes \u00a3292 billion of assets managed for Aviva companies, making Aviva  Investors  pivotal  to  the  Group's  wider  success.  Its  long track-record in private debt, infrastructure, and other real assets, has supported our growth in areas such as bulk purchase annuities.\n\nAviva  Investors  adjusted  operating  profit 4 was  11%  lower  at \u00a385 million (2019: \u00a396 million) mainly driven by lower revenue partly offset by a reduction in controllable costs 5 . Aviva Investors revenues 5 were impacted by lower contribution from securities lending and a reduction in origination fees reflecting lower demand for alternative strategies as risk appetites reduced in response to COVID-19.\n\nAviva  Investors  maintained  the  positive  client  momentum  with positive external clients' net flows 5 of \u00a31.7 billion (excluding liquidity funds), with significant new business wins in real assets and in credit. Total  net  flows 5 of  \u00a38.5  billion (2019:  \u00a3(2.8)  billion) included \u00a38.3 billion of net flows 5 into liquidity funds and cash.",

Aviva Investors has a decades-long track-record of being at the forefront of sustainable  investing  having  launched  the  Stewardship  range  of funds, the UK's first ethical fund range, back in 1984.\n\nThis heritage continues as evidenced by Aviva Investors being ranked 2 1 globally  for  our  environmental  voting  track  record  and  5 2 for responsible investment by Share Action. We continue to lead in this field having launched our climate transition engagement programme  with  a  promise  to  divest  from  companies  that  are non-responsive to our expectation that all companies should adopt a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\n## Manage-for-value markets\n\nOur businesses in continental Europe and Asia delivered adjusted operating  profit 3 of  \u00a31,311  million (2019:  \u00a31,150  million) ,  up  14% 4 .

We  are  in  a  unique  position  to  solve  customer problems through each step of their lives as we are a trusted provider of  a  broad  range  of  products  to  both  individual  and  corporate customers covering their savings, retirement, insurance and health needs.  Our  strategy  is  to  invest  for  growth,  through  which  we  will become the UK's leading insurer and establish Aviva as the 'go-to' customer brand for all insurance, protection, savings and retirement needs for all of our customers.\n\nThrough our savings, retirement and protection businesses, we help individuals save and achieve financial peace of mind through their workplace, advisers or engaging directly with us as well as manage their savings and income up to and through retirement. We also help\n\n## Manage-for-value markets\n\n- \u221e Our businesses in continental Europe and Asia\n\nour corporate customers with de-risking solutions for their pension schemes and promote wellbeing and health with  their  workforce. Strong  brand  awareness  and  a  proven  track  record  in  customer experience  have  allowed  us  to  develop  strong  relationships  with distribution  partners  such  as  independent  financial  advisers, employee benefit consultants, banks and estate agents as well as offering digital direct solutions to customers.\n\nIn times of uncertainty and economic volatility, our financial strength provides  our  customers  and  investors  with  certainty.  We  are  well capitalised  and  have  demonstrated  resilience  to  stress  through  a period of considerable market uncertainty. We receive a significant capital efficiency advantage from the composite nature of the UK Life business and the wider Aviva Group.\n\nIn Ireland our strategy is to transform and grow the business. Having successfully integrated Friends First Life Assurance Company DAC, we're focused on delivering a single product range to the market and we  are  committed  to  making  it  easier  for  intermediaries  to  do business  with  Aviva.  Ireland  Life  is  currently  fourth  in  the  market, holding a 13% share 6 , and the business has set an ambitious target to become the market leading intermediary provider.\n\n## Market overview\n\nThe global pandemic brought about immense change for customers and institutions such as Aviva. Customer behaviours and attitudes towards  insurers  have  evolved.  We  have  seen  an  acceleration  in digital adoption, rapid shifts in mobility and customer engagement, and a new focus on work/life habits. On top of these developments, trends  from  before  the  pandemic also  remain  relevant;  in  the  UK, 24% of the population will be over 65 in 20 years 7 , 85% of investible assets  is  owned  by  over  45s 7 and  \u00a33.0 trillion  of  housing  equity  is owned by over 55s 7 .\n\nWith  our  diverse  product  range  we  are  well  placed  to  meet  the changing  needs  of  customers  through  their  lives,  from  the accumulation  stage  to  retirement.  Our  strong  financial  position enables us to provide security to customers while investing in our proposition,  improving  connectivity  for  our  intermediary  partners, and  bringing  to  the  market  innovative  health  and  wellbeing solutions.\n\n- 1 This is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) which provides useful information to enhance the understanding of financial performance.

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nOur market review > UK & Ireland Life continued\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n## Products Savings & Retirement\n\nOur Savings & Retirement business is a leader in both the workplace and  retail  markets,  we  are  the  UK's  largest  bundled  Workplace provider 1 giving us scale and our Retail business continues to grow strongly. Aviva Save, a solution for existing customers' cash savings, launched  internally  in  December  2020  and  reached  the  external market in  January  2021.  Our  products  are  supported  by  guidance and  advice  and  offer  access  to  open  architecture  asset  solutions including Aviva Investors who provide expertise in ESG investing. We have been working closely with Aviva Investors to develop tailored underlying  investment  solutions  such  as  our  approach  to  ESG investing and Smooth Managed Fund. We also continue investing in our  platforms  for  workplace,  advisers  and  direct  customers  to enhance the experience, service and propositions on offer. Our new business  is  capital  efficient  and  transparent,  with  profits  being derived from assets under management (AUM) 2 fees less costs.\n\nDuring 2020, new business was impacted by uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Average investment values were lower caused by market falls,  movement  restrictions  prevented  advisers  from  working  and new scheme wins were deferred into 2021 due to clients seeking less volatility, with PVNBP 2 decreasing by 7%  to  \u00a317.6  billion (2019: \u00a318.9 billion) . Net flows 2 increased  14%  to  \u00a38.5 billion (2019: \u00a37.5 billion) due to higher auto-enrolment volumes and a larger asset base compared to 2019 which offset the impact of lower new business.\n\n## Annuities & Equity Release\n\nOur Annuities & Equity Release business consists of bulk purchase annuities  (BPA),  individual  annuities  and  equity  release.  Our products offer customers safe and secure income in their retirement and  support  employers  in  their  desire  to  de-risk  their  pension schemes. We are the UK's largest provider of individual annuities 3 , we manage the UK's largest book of equity release mortgages 4 ,  and in the first half of 2020 we were the third largest provider of BPAs 5 . Our Annuities  &  Equity  Release  products  create  synergies,  with  equity release  assets  being  held  long-term  to  back  longer-term  annuity liabilities,  alongside  assets  sourced  by  Aviva  Investors.  Profits  are primarily driven by yields, and our focus on capital efficiency secures significant cash flows, which has allowed us to invest in, and grow, our BPA business.\n\nThe UK BPA market remains attractive to us and we will seek further opportunities  as  more  businesses  look  to  de-risk  their  pension schemes. We have improved the capital efficiency of our BPA new business  by  partnering  with  new  reinsurance  counterparties  and leveraged our illiquid asset origination capabilities to meet our asset origination  targets  despite  unprecedented  market  conditions.  We utilise  reinsurance  to  manage  exposure  to  longevity  risk  emerging from higher BPA volumes. In 2020, our BPA sales grew strongly by 48%  to  \u00a36.0 billion (2019: \u00a34.0 billion) , more  than  an  eightfold increase over the last five years, reflecting our continued focus on capturing market opportunities with attractive pricing.\n\nThrough  our  individual  annuities  we  provide  an  income  to approximately  one  million  customers.  We  have  a  long  and  proud record in providing equity release (lifetime mortgages) to customers who need it, lending over \u00a3500 million to customers in 2020.\n\nEquity  release  was  impacted  by  COVID-19  movement  restrictions during the year which reduced many intermediaries' ability to write new business as well as our ability to value properties. We addressed this by introducing remote valuations to our equity release lending process,  giving  customers  access  to  funds  released  through  their properties. Despite lower volumes, our market share remains strong and we are the third largest provider of equity release mortgages in the UK 3 .\n\n## Protection & Health\n\nAviva is the only provider of scale in the UK covering health, group protection  and  individual  protection.  We  have  number  two 3 positions in protection markets and are third 6 in the health market. We  have  developed  strong  relationships  with  our  intermediary partners, including financial advisers, estate agents and other third parties. We have invested for growth in these markets, focusing on our  digital  proposition  and  bringing  new  health  &  wellbeing  to market. Pricing and underwriting discipline as well as cost efficiency are key drivers for profitability in this sector.\n\nOur individual protection products protect our customers when they fall upon difficult times such as bereavement or serious illness. The individual protection market is highly competitive, with pressure on both  volumes  and  margins.  COVID-19  significantly  disrupted individual protection sales during 2020 as the stalled housing market caused applications to fall. We saw a shift to direct channel business following implementation of movement restrictions in the first half of 2020 but this was not enough to offset the reduction in sales through channels which rely on face to face contact, such as with our estate agent partners.\n\nGroup protection new business grew compared to 2019, with PVNBP 2 of  \u00a3716  million (2019:  \u00a3518  million) despite  pausing  new  business sales during the first national lockdown. Volume growth was driven by group income protection.\n\nWe aim to differentiate our individual and group protection offering by going beyond simply offering financial support to our customers and providing health and wellbeing support focusing on prevention and  best  in  class  customer  service.  Our  data  analytics  and underwriting capabilities give us a strong advantage in a competitive market.\n\nOur Health proposition helps customers to live more healthily and support them and their families when they fall ill. We understand that customers  needed  us  more  than  ever  in  2020.  As  well  as  offering payment  deferrals  to  customers  who  needed  it  the  most,  we recognised the restricted availability of private treatments in 2020 by pledging to refund Health policyholders if claims costs in 2020 and 2021 are lower than expected as a result of COVID-19. Health PVNBP 2 grew to \u00a3513 million (2019: \u00a3507 million) year-on-year due to higher large corporate business sales.\n\n## Ireland Life\n\nOur core lines of business in Ireland are pre and post-retirement unitlinked  contracts,  unit-linked  savings  &  investment  contracts,  in addition to protection and annuity contracts.\n\nIn 2020, the business delivered the fourth and fifth key deliverables in its Integrated Product Launch Programme, offering the best of both Aviva and Friends First Life Assurance Company to customers and intermediaries.",

Overall  PVNBP 1 decreased  by  3%  to \u00a31,534 million (2019: \u00a31,589 million) .\n\n## Customers\n\nAcross the UK Life business we delivered year-on-year improvements across multiple customer service measures.\n\nOur  transactional  net  promotor  scores  (TNPS),  a  measure  of  the number  of  customers  who  would  recommend  us  following  a purchase,  service  or  claim,  has  increased  by  2  points  to  +45 (2019: +43).\n\nOur focus on 'Brilliant Basics' continues to drive lower transactional backlogs, fewer customer complaints and improved speed to service customer  queries.  We  have  used  our  data  analytics  capability  to identify  and  assess  key  customer  issues  across  a  wide  range  of customer data.\n\nThese  improvements  were  achieved  despite  the  enormous resourcing  and  systems  challenges,  brought  about  from  the continued impact of COVID-19. At the height of the crisis, we moved all staff to working from home while maintaining service levels.\n\nWe are proud not only of the scale of the financial and wider support that our protection products provide, but the care and speed with which  claims  are  managed.  In  2019  we  paid  out  98.6%  of  life insurance claims equating to \u00a3582 million.\n\nWe are very proud to have won a number of industry awards for the service we provide to our customers. This includes Best Customer Service Provider at the 2020 Health Insurance & Protection awards, Best Claims Management/Claims Team at the 2020 Cover Excellence Awards and Best Equity Release Customer Service at the 2020 What Mortgage Awards. Our Workplace proposition won the Best Use of Technology  for  Benefits  category  at  the  Workplace  Savings  and Benefits Awards in October 2020 and the Retail Adviser Platform won Best Use of Platform Technology at the Schroders Platform Awards in December 2020. We were also ranked first place by Kagool in their FTSE  100  Digital  Census  for  communications  support  offered  to customers during the  height  of  the  COVID-19  crisis  from  March  to May.\n\nIn Ireland we have been committed to supporting our customers and intermediaries  in  response  to  the  challenges  posed  by  COVID-19, with the introduction of premium deferrals and premium holidays for impacted  customers.  In  addition  we  are  committed  to  making  it easier  for  intermediaries  to  do  business  with  Aviva.  To  further support our intermediaries, the business held a series of 21 webinars, with c.22,000 attendees in total, delivering a 98.5% TNPS score.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nWith over 11 million customers we have one of the largest customer bases in the UK life and savings market. 3.5 million of our customers have  registered  on  our  MyAviva  app,  allowing  policyholders  easy access  to  the  most  important  information  about  their  policy  on mobile  devices.  1.8  million  customers  have  registered  on  our\n\nMyPension app generating over 13,000 daily logins, and we have seen digital engagement increase by 53% during 2020.\n\nOur  Workplace  business  is  largely  intermediated  with  over  26,000 clients  and  3.8  million  members.  We  are  the  only  provider  to  be awarded  the  maximum  '6  gold  star'  rating  from  the  Finance  & Technology  Research  Centre  for  our  2020  workplace  pension solutions and auto enrolment.\n\nOur Retail business offers access to our market leading platform to both intermediated and direct customers. Working closely with our platform technology partners, we delivered a substantial upgrade to our platform software, bringing new features to benefit both advisers and  customers  who  choose  to  manage  their  investments  directly with  us.  We  have  built  relationships  with  c.5,000  advisory  firms. During the COVID-19 crisis, our distribution team have built on our already strong relationships with independent financial adviser (IFA) firms by staying in close contact with them and understanding how they've been dealing with the crisis, how their models and needs may change, and how we can support that.\n\nOur Protection business is built upon strong relationships with our partners.  Our  distribution  network  includes  intermediaries,  banks, single-tie agreements with three of the largest estate agencies and a digital direct offering.\n\nDuring  2020,  we  successfully  launched  a  number  of  initiatives  to assist our customers across distribution channels. Our new IFA portal Aviva Connect provides single sign in for intermediaries across our products. We launched Digicare+, a new digital app offering a range of services to support individual and group protection customers in their  day-to-day health and wellbeing, bringing differentiation and meaningful engagement.\n\nOur ongoing focus on building our digital capability has transformed how  we  engage  with  customers  and  brokers.  We  now  offer  94% digital  coverage  for  protection  demands  and  99%  of  interactions with Health brokers are now carried out digitally.\n\nWe have been working closely with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to explore the rules around guidance, and options to be able to better support our customers. Our Aviva Guidance Experts have been supporting  our  customers,  both  new  and  existing,  to  help  them understand  their  personal  retirement  options.  We've  collaborated across  the  business  to  deliver  social  media,  online  signposts  and targeted email campaigns in order to reach customers who might need our support.\n\nIn  Ireland  we  continue  to  focus  on  intermediaries  as  our  core distribution channel. In 2019, the intermediary channel accounted for  74%  of  total  market  sales  on  an  annual  premium  equivalent (APE) 1 basis.\n\nThe Irish Life business holds a strong position in the intermediated retail  market  and  has  plans  in  place  to  continue  to  challenge  for leadership in protection lines while focusing on the simplification of our  business,  making  it  easier  for  intermediaries  to  interact  with Aviva.\n\n## Key business strategic priorities for 2021\n\n- \u221e Maintain  strong  growth  in  UK  Savings  through  our  leading Workplace and Platform propositions\n- \u221e Continue  to  seek  capital  efficient  BPA  opportunities  to  increase long term cash flow\n- \u221e Capitalise  on  our  data  analytics  capability  to  bring  innovative propositions to the marketplace\n- \u221e In Ireland we will focus on improving efficiency, optimising product profitability and the final phase of our Integrated Product Launch Programme.",

We have consistently maintained our market share in both the UK & Ireland with market shares of 10% and 13%, respectively 3 .\n\nOur strategy is to invest for growth to deliver on our ambition of being the leading insurer in the UK and Ireland as measured by premium, reputation,  trust,  breadth  of  distribution  and  strength  of  digital platform.\n\nOur  strength  of  distribution,  brand  recognition,  digital  innovation, and high level of service are what set us apart for our customers and intermediaries. TNPS (Transactional Net Promotor Score) and broker trust scores continue to be market leading across all areas, with our UK claims service being ranked world class. The quality of our service has enabled us to hold long-term relationships with four of the UK's six largest banks to provide their insurance solutions.\n\nWe are recognised as being market leading in our digital capability. Our  'Ask-It-Never'  technology  deployment  into  banking  partners, market leading  Commercial digital trading  platform,  and  machine learning based pricing are some of the reasons why intermediaries partner  with  us.  2020  saw  the  launch  of  the  Aviva  brand  on  price comparison  websites,  complementing  our  General  Accident  (GA) and  Quote  Me  Happy  (QMH)  brands.  Our  UK  business  has  been through  a  reorganisation  and  we  have  begun  a  restructuring program  in  Ireland  which  we  will  complete  during  2021.  The platforms are now in place for growth in a competitive market.\n\nAviva's  continued  strength  in  the  Intermediary  sector  has  been reflected  in  several  awards  won  during  2020.  Aviva  were  the  first insurer to secure a clean sweep of Personal lines, Commercial lines and General Insurer of the Year awards, in a single year, at the 2020\n\nBritish  Insurance  Awards  while  we  also  secured  a  record  seventh consecutive General Insurer of the Year award at the Insurance Times awards.\n\n## Personal lines\n\nIn  Personal lines, our growth ambitions are centered firstly on our retail sales channels, including sales of the Aviva brand on all price comparison websites and secondly on targeted activity with specific broker and partner relationships. We are rationalising our product portfolio and investing in digital innovations to deliver solutions that are both more efficient and easier for our customers.\n\n## Commercial lines\n\nIn  Commercial  lines,  our  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  strong distribution  and  superior  products  and  risk  management  to  grow market  share  in  targeted  customer  segments.  A  favourable underwriting  environment,  and  strong  retention  rates  driven  by service  and  broker  sentiment,  allows  us  to  deploy  digital  and automated  solutions  where  speed  and  simplicity  is  valued,  while offering  technical  and  bespoke  service  for  more  complicated  risks with our large, corporate clients.\n\n## Market overview\n\nDuring  2020,  we  have  had  to  deal  with  COVID-19,  proposed  and confirmed changes in regulation, and a number of weather events in the UK. These conditions have materially impacted 2020 and we can also expect a significant impact continuing into 2021.\n\nIn  the  large  corporate  &  specialty  markets,  there  has  been  a prolonged  period  of  under-pricing  on  global  property,  increased frequency in natural catastrophes and prior year reserving issues on non-UK casualty and Directors' & Officers' Insurance. The market is now experiencing hardening for the first time in almost two decades and rates are trending upwards. This provides us with an opportunity to continue our strong growth trajectory, at attractive technical rates, and  tackle  historically  poor  performing  business.  In  Ireland,  our Commercial lines appetite will now expand into larger risks.\n\nIn  the  Small  Medium  Enterprises  (SME)  sector,  the  impact  of COVID-19 has significantly affected SME performance and businesses have had to close or adapt their models and change their risk profiles as  a  response  to  the  pandemic.  The  sector  is  continuing  to  suffer from  significant  levels  of  underinsurance,  and  we  are  proactively utilising  our  Commercial  Intelligence  Tool  to  identify  gaps  in coverage to support our brokers and customers.\n\nWe continue to work with our existing customers to resolve complex issues and key challenges facing the industry, including care home and cladding risks.\n\nIn  the  year,  the  FCA  sought  guidance through a legal Test Case to determine whether specific, disputed policy wordings called for the payment of business interruption claims arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Aviva was not a party to the Test Case, but fully supported the  process.  The  test  case  did  not  require  any  change  to  our customer approach, nor require further provisions. Throughout this period,  where  cover  was  confirmed,  we  have  adjusted  claims  and made payments and will continue to do so.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  FCA  published  their  General  Insurance  Pricing Practices Report. We support the FCA's intent to bring greater clarity and consistency to consumers across general insurance pricing. This will be a significant area of focus for us over the next 12 months.",

        "page_content": "Our market review > General Insurance UK & Ireland continued\n\nThe  market  continues  to  experience  a  trend  towards  digitisation, further accelerated by pandemic-induced lockdowns.\n\nThe Consumer Insurance Contracts Act was enacted in Ireland, with the  requirements  to  be  implemented  by  September  2021.  This represents  a  significant  change  for  Irish  insurers  but  will  improve customer trust and transparency levels.\n\nWe recognise shifts in mobility, with personal transport shifting from private  ownership to more efficient, safer  and  cleaner  models  like sharing, electric fleets and, in time, self-driving vehicles. Commercial transport,  where  these  changes  are  likely  to  be  seen  first,  will  see similar  trends.  COVID-19  may  have  put  some  of  these  changes  on relative pause but, longer term, permanent reductions in commuting will further contribute to shifts in models. At Aviva we are well placed as these changes develop, given our strengths both in personal car and commercial fleet insurance.\n\n## Operational highlights\n\nWe have been simplifying our business structure to provide simple digitised  customer  journeys  and  establish  an  efficient  operational base.\n\n## Products\n\n## Personal lines\n\nIn  the  UK,  we  offer  Personal  lines  insurance,  with  a  core  focus  on home,  motor  and  travel  insurance.  Our  personal  motor  digital solution  allows  customers  greater  control  over  their  claims  with online reporting and a self-serve booking tool for car repairs.\n\nWe have delivered a profit turnaround by simplifying products and IT infrastructure,  increasing  our  investment  in  digital  customer journeys while cutting overall costs and improving the sophistication of our pricing models. We have made several changes to our travel product  for  existing  customers  to  ensure  we  continue  to  provide strong protection for COVID-19 related claims.\n\nTo cut complexity from our business, we have removed 111 products from UK Personal lines this year and to simplify our home product, we halved the number of pages in our policy document during Q420. The process of simplifying our product and IT architecture allows us to  focus  on  customers'  greatest  needs.  In  2021,  we  will  continue progress towards our target of 65% reduction in products by the end of 2022, vs 2020 baseline.\n\nIn Ireland, we focus on home and motor insurance in Personal lines. We're constantly updating our private motor rating models to ensure that we continue to have market-leading risk selection.\n\n## Commercial lines\n\nIn  the  UK, we offer Commercial lines insurance to a wide range of businesses,  from  micro  through  small  and  mid-market  to  large, multinational corporates. In Ireland, we provide commercial cover to all sized businesses.\n\nIn a year dominated by COVID-19, we have grown our Commercial lines  business  10%  by  maintaining  positive  broker  and  client sentiment throughout the year. We have grown SME business by 4% and Global Corporate Specialty (GCS) by 16%. This growth has been supported by new client acquisitions, a strong rate environment in corporate  and  specialty  and  an  acceleration  of  our  digital capabilities within SME.\n\nWe have enhanced our propositions, provided innovative solutions for our customers, extended our product range and invested in our Digital Cyber product ahead of the launch in the first half of 2021. We have  introduced  new  products  such  as  a  single  vehicle  mini-fleet product for our SME customers, a full suite of financial lines coverage for our regional clients and an enhancement of our Regional Cyber product  to  provide  comprehensive  solutions  for  businesses.  To enhance  our  proposition  for  our  multinational  clients,  we  have harmonised our client relationship management model and we have also expanded  our  claims  service management  model  to additionally support our mid-market customers.\n\nIn  line  with  Aviva's  ESG  strategy,  we  have  continued  to  grow  our Renewables  book  and  support  our  commercial  customers  with transitioning to more sustainable ways of working.\n\n## Customers\n\nMany customer highlights this year were delivered in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n- \u221e Seamlessly  transitioned  to  remote  working  and  maintained operational service throughout the pandemic.\n- \u221e Provided  financial  hardship  support  for  customers  experiencing financial difficulty.\n- \u221e Enabling policy changes for cover that is no longer required. This included  mileage  changes,  removing  add-ons,  and  offering  prorata refunds to travel insurance customers who are no longer able to travel.\n- \u221e Supported businesses who had to change or adapt their business models and extended our coverage for empty premises.\n- \u221e Provided risk management and prevention guidance to business customers, virtually and on-site.\n- \u221e Maximising  new  business  and  renewal  outcomes  by  effectively delivering a whole account underwriting approach.\n- \u221e Tailored,  bespoke  offerings  for  our  mid-market,  corporate  and multinational clients.\n- \u221e Launched our back to business campaign to provide information and  guidance  for  our  intermediaries  and  clients  on  a  range  of topics  ranging  from  market  support,  to  underinsurance  and  the impact of a hardening market.\n\nMore than 50% of Personal lines direct customers hold more than one GI product with us. Our Commercial lines customers hold more than  three  products  with  us  on  average,  and  our  retention  rates remain over 80%. This demonstrates our customers' satisfaction with our products and services, which is reinforced by our upper quartile RNPS (Relationship Net Promotor Score), which is 17 points ahead of the  competitor  benchmark.  In  Ireland,  our  Customer  Trust  score increased by 1% and is 4pp ahead of competitor benchmark.\n\nInvestment in digital and claims management has enabled UK motor customers  to  start  and  complete  their  claims  online  with  no underwriter touch points. Customers are demonstrating a preference  towards  digital  interactions,  with  80%  taking  the opportunity to book in their car repairs online.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nOur  retail  businesses  across  UK  and  Ireland  now  service  over 3.3  million  customers.  We  have  a  multi-channel  distribution  for Personal  lines  that  includes  selling  direct  to  customers  through MyAviva  and  price  comparison  sites,  as  well  as  relationships  with several of the UK's leading banks, affinity partners and brokers. In Commercial lines, which is distributed via intermediaries, we enjoy strong relationships with brokers of all sizes that allows us to cater for both Global & Corporate and SME clients.",

Over 9,000 brokers have joined one of our #backtobusiness webinars.\n\nIn the second half of the year, our UK business launched the Aviva brand on price comparison websites for motor and home insurance. This allows customers a greater choice of distribution channels to use when buying an Aviva insurance product and has improved our growth in the final quarter of the year.\n\nIn support of our banking partners and our digital agenda, we have deployed our 'Ask-It-Never' underwriting approach with two of our four  major  banking  partners  this  year.  Ask-It-Never  delivers  datadriven frictionless experiences for customers, reducing application time for new business by half.\n\nGrowth in UK SME digitally traded business grew by 16% in 2020 as a result  of  our  accelerated  technology,  proposition  and  product offering  in  Digital.  Our  award-winning  Fast  Trade  platform  is  a resilient  business  model  that  has  maintained  service  performance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic for our customers.

In Ireland, we are investing in our small Commercial E-Trade offering to avail of the opportunity in this space.\n\n## Key priorities for 2021:\n\n- \u221e Deliver  simple,  end-to-end  digital  experience  for  our  retail customers, and continue to automate and accelerate our digital capabilities to support our commercial clients.\n- \u221e Deliver on growth targets.

Aviva Canada holds the number three position 4 with an 8% market share, offering a range of GI products to nearly 2.4 million customers. We  are  a  well-diversified  business  across  our  Personal  and Commercial portfolios, with a national footprint and multi-channel distribution capabilities.\n\nWe are investing for growth and our ambition is to be the leading insurer  in  Canada  by  becoming  the  undisputed  choice  for  our customers, distributors and our people. Our strategy, aligned to the Group strategic pillars is to (1) sustain leading performance through execution excellence, (2) transform the service experience through digital, and (3) lead the market with customer centric innovation.\n\nOur people (who scored 15% higher on engagement than the top quartile for Canadian financial services companies) continue to be a significant advantage for our business.\n\n## Personal lines\n\nOur retail business is predominantly sold through brokers and under RBC Insurance, under the most recognised financial services brand in Canada. Here, our focus is to improve pricing sophistication and operational efficiency. Our specialty products, such as pleasure-craft, recreational vehicles (RV), classic cars and snowmobiles, continue to be a profitable growth driver and our product range, service, broker relationships  and  best-in-class  claims  service  set  us  apart  in  the market. Our investment in Digital Direct will ensure that our Direct book  grows  rapidly  and  sustainably,  allowing  us  to  respond  to shifting consumer preferences.\n\n## Commercial lines\n\nWe will leverage our market leading customer reach to support our smallest customers by providing easy transactional solutions for our broker partners, while positioning to grow through improved service via  operational  efficiency  and  attractive  pricing.  In  our  larger  and more  complex  business  segments,  our  focus  is  on  competing through underwriting expertise. Additionally, we will accelerate our growth  in  our  Corporate  Risks  segment  leveraging  Customer  Risk Management, and an improved proposition (cross border/multinational).  Our  surety  business  has  an  extensive  client network  and  will  look  to  navigate  any  economic  recovery  with underwriting discipline.\n\n## Market overview\n\nGiven  the  COVID-19  impact  on  the  economy,  customers  and  our people, there is much uncertainty in the insurance market.\n\nCanada continues to be in a low-interest rate environment, similar to the  2009  recessionary  period,  and  the  Bank  of  Canada  is  not expected  to  pursue  additional  rate  increases  until  the  economy demonstrates  a  return  to  above-potential  pace.  Recessionary conditions have affected consumer spending, with higher debt levels and unemployment in 2020.\n\nThe  shift  in  consumer  behaviours  to  digital  has  accelerated  the growing  need  for  digital  capabilities  and  increased  the  pace  of technological change among carriers and brokers. Additionally, the physical distancing initiatives and increase in remote working over the past year has led to a reduction in auto claims frequency, which will continue to drive increased government and regulatory pressure and impact pricing. The Canadian personal motor market is highly regulated and commoditised.\n\nIn Commercial  insurance, reduced capacity and sustained market-wide under-pricing over the years has led to a significantly hardening market during 2020. A number of small businesses have closed  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic  and  many  companies  are operating below capacity, which is likely to suppress new business policy count.\n\nIndustry consolidation of both insurers and distributors continues. In addition to insurers growing market share through acquisition, there is also a continued drive to control distribution through the vertical integration of brokers.\n\nWeather-related  catastrophe  events  continue  to  rise  in  frequency and severity, impacting our models and risk exposure concentration.\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n## Products\n\nOur  Personal  insurance  portfolio  ($CAD3.6  billion,  65%  of  overall business  mix)  is  largely  made  up  of  mass  market  propositions, particularly in regulated lines/geographies.\n\nThis  year,  we  continued  to  make  good  progress  against  our  data science, pricing sophistication and claims agendas, while our future focus is on digitising the proposition and service experience in order to deliver value and compete on price.\n\nIn  2020  our  gross  written  premium  increased  year-on-year  and despite  the  pandemic,  we  have  seen  strong  new  business performance and policy retention.\n\n- 1 This is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) which provides useful information to enhance the understanding of financial performance.

        "page_content": "Strategic report\n\nGovernance\n\nIFRS financial statements\n\nOur market review > General Insurance Canada continued\n\n## Personal lines\n\nOur  personal  insurance  business  is  made  up  of  Retail  and  Group Home  and  Auto,  High  Net  Worth  proposition  as  well  as  Lifestyle products. In 2021, our personal insurance growth is projected to be in line with the market (i.e. low single digit) with opportunistic growth anticipated in our Direct channel (due to changing consumer buying trends) as well as in our less commoditised specialty lines, where we have  market  leading  expertise.  However,  we  remain  cautious  as COVID-19  relief  measures  are  expected  to  offset  any  organic customer growth.\n\n## Commercial lines\n\nOur  Commercial  insurance  business  is  made  up  of  SME  (20%  of overall business) and GCS (15% of overall business), where we offer Commercial  auto,  property  and  casualty  products  across  various customer  and  industry  segments.  Our  focus  for  these  businesses continues to be around pricing and underwriting fundamentals with strong distribution and client management capabilities.\n\nDespite  COVID-19,  we  ended  the  year  with  above  average  market growth  in  SME  (c.8%)  and  in  GCS  (c.10%)  due  to  hard  market conditions. As capacity in the market continues to be strained, we plan  to  deliver  strong  premium  and  customer  growth  in  target segments through 2021 (particularly SME Middle Market, Surety and Corporate Risk). The impact of COVID-19 on net claims for 2020 was $CAD269  million.  This  incorporates  reported  and  expected  future claims primarily in relation to business interruption losses related to COVID-19.  Notwithstanding  this,  numerous  class  action  lawsuits have been brought against Aviva Canada and the wider insurance sector relating to business interruption coverage. We expect to be engaged in defending these actions of a number of years.\n\n## Customers\n\nOur  claims  TNPS  performance  (Auto  +61,  Property  +54)  remains strong  due  to  internal  efforts  and  our  claims  transformation programme. We have seen continuous improvement in our claims process,  where  cycle  time  has  reduced  significantly  compared  to 2019  and  we  are  focused  on  quick  settlements,  automation  and digitising key customer touchpoints.\n\nOverall  complaint  volumes  for  2020  are  down  17%  compared  to 2019.  In  2021,  we  will  continue  to  investigate  the  top  complaints drivers and work to address root causes of these issues. A focus on ease of doing business through understanding what customers and partners need from us, and delivering against those needs in a single interaction, has maintained a First Contact Resolution ratio of 88%.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nIn Canada, we have nearly 2.4 million customers; one of the largest customer bases in the Property & Casualty market. We have a strong, long-standing relationship with our network of over 800 independent brokers  and  a  partnership  with  Royal  Bank  of  Canada  (RBC),  the largest  bank 1 (market  share  20%)  and  most  valuable  number  in Canada 1 ,  with  a  significant  portion  of  high  net  worth  customers. However, shifting consumer behaviours and an evolving Canadian distribution landscape highlight the importance of accelerating our direct-to-consumer proposition.\n\nHistorically  we  have  primarily  sold  our  personal  and  commercial insurance  propositions  through  intermediaries.  The  acquisition  of RBC  General  Insurance  in  2016  included  a  15-year  strategic distribution agreement between RBC and Aviva. The RBC Insurance Agency,  a  distributor  for  RBC  home  and  auto  insurance  solutions underwritten  by  Aviva,  now  makes  up  approximately  23%  of  our overall personal insurance business.\n\nWe  are  continuing  to  invest  in  our  broker  channel  through  the modernisation of our policy system which will deliver an improved broker experience via a new broker portal, additional connectivity, and new self-serve capabilities.\n\nAdditionally,  we  have  plans  to  build  our  Direct  channel  into  a meaningful business for customers who wish to transact with Aviva digitally and in order to truly diversify our channel mix.\n\nOur commercial lines business remains intermediated by our broker network, as well as via Managing General Agents, whose proposition is based on their ability to provide a unique product or expertise for a specific group of customers.\n\n## Key priorities for 2021:\n\n- \u221e Continue  to  strengthen  our  insurance  fundamentals  including pricing, underwriting, claims management, data science and risk and control capabilities.\n- \u221e Modernising our systems and infrastructure to deliver change at pace.\n- \u221e Enhance our service experience to make it easy for customers and distributors to engage with, buy and sell Aviva and RBC.\n- \u221e Deliver focused growth by optimising, scaling and diversifying our portfolio and channels.",

Managers are also increasingly focusing on ESG opportunities.\n\nWe  differentiate  ourselves  in  the  market  through  our  engaged approach  and  demonstrable  leadership  in  sustainability,  both through ESG propositions and how we invest. On climate change, where  we  are  unable  to  influence  companies  to  demonstrate  a substantial commitment to tackle global warming as an investor, we are willing to use the 'ultimate sanction' of divesting.\n\nOur leadership position in ESG is recognised with various industry awards and ratings:\n\n- \u221e Aviva  Investors  scores  are  above  average  in  all  modules  of  the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) ratings which covers over $100 trillion in AUM 1 ;\n- \u221e Multiple international awards including the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) Global Stewardship Award 2019,  and  the  Global  Investment  Group  (GIG)  Investment Excellence Award 2019 ESG Manager of the Year; and\n- \u221e A  recognised  leadership  position  in  promoting  sustainability disclosures with involvement in initiatives such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Continuous Data Protection (CDP).\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n## Products\n\nConcerns over the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 led to significant  volatility  in  financial  markets  and  elevated  levels  of investor activity throughout 2020.\n\nClient appetite for lower-risk investment strategies was the primary driver of lower revenue for the year.\n\nNotwithstanding the challenging market conditions, we had positive momentum  in  our  Aviva  client  and  external  client  businesses throughout 2020.\n\nFor our Aviva clients, significant inflows of \u00a35.1 billion from the Core business, primarily on the Adviser channel, Workplace and annuities in  the  UK,  were  offset  by  \u00a36.5  billion  outflows  from  the  run-off  in assets for the existing back book.\n\nExternal  net  inflows  of  \u00a31.7  billion  in  the  period  were  driven  by positive gross flows of \u00a38.3 billion, with significant new business wins in Real Assets (\u00a31.8 billion) and Credit (\u00a33.2 billion).\n\nWe  continued  to  experience  strong  momentum  in  our  Liquidity business, with \u00a35.5 billion of net liquidity fund inflows and 80 new client accounts.\n\n## Customers\n\nOur  investment  performance  was  not  immune  from  the  market turbulence, and at the end of December 2020 55% of our funds were ahead of benchmark over one year.\n\nConsistent  delivery  of  strong  investment  performance  is  key  to meeting our customers' investment needs and remains a key priority.\n\nOur ongoing focus on ESG creates easy ways for our customers to do good,  leading  by  example  and  influencing  others  to  act,  thereby playing an active role in the fight against climate change, creating a stronger  economy  and  society  as  well  as  generating  enhanced shareholder value over the long-term.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nOur Aviva client distribution channels mainly comprise:\n\n- \u221e Savings & Retirement, where we develop ESG-focused propositions  to  meet  the  long-term  savings  needs  of  Aviva's defined contribution pension and savings customers; and\n- \u221e Aviva  shareholder,  where  we  develop  investment  solutions  to support  Aviva's  growth  ambitions,  primarily  in  the  UK  bulk purchase annuity and individual annuity markets.",

Aviva France is ranked 3rd amongst the traditional insurers.\n\nOur  business  offers  a  full  range  of  savings,  investment,  protection and  health  insurance  products  with  strength  in  distribution  with Epargne Actuelle our 100% owned life broker, Union Financiere de France (UFF) the number 2 financial adviser network, tied agents and independent  brokers,  and  partnering  with  Association  Fran\u00e7aise d'\u00c9pargne  et  de  Retraite  (AFER),  through  France's  number  one savers' association.\n\nThe French general insurance market grew by +2.5% to \u20ac50.5 billion to the end of September 2020 3 , with premiums split between 3 main categories;  mutual  without  intermediaries  (c.23%),  bancassurers (c.15%) and other traditional insurers (c.62%). In the personal lines (mainly  motor),  competition  is  intense,  with  well-established mutuals and traditional players facing increasing competition from bancassurers and from small to midsize players aiming to maintain their  market  shares.  While  the  pure  Direct  only  captures  c.2%  of distribution so far, full multichannel distribution (direct and physical) is becoming increasingly relevant in individual.\n\nMotor and Home premiums increased by respectively 2.3% and 3.2% in the French market at the end of November 2020, a slower growth rate compared to 2019.\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 crisis, General Insurance new business and claims saw a decrease of 20% in Motor claims frequency at the end of November 2020. A return to a second nationwide lockdown (although  less  severe  than  the  first  lockdown)  and  the  strong economic  downturn  this  caused  (GDP  expected  at  c.(8)%  in  2020 compared to 2019), translates into an uncertain mid-term outlook in the  general  insurance  market,  with  an  intensification  of  price competition  on  personal  lines  and  an  increased  underwriting pressure on the commercial lines, in a context where the interest rate environment weighs on financial performance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to consider re-adjusting operating losses coverage. In this context, in cooperation with the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance, the French Insurance Federation  set  up  a  working  group  to  develop  a  framework  for providing insurance for a systemic crisis, such as a global pandemic, via a public-private partnership.\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n## Products\n\nIn late 2018 the French government proposed new laws that seek to shift  savings  and  investment  towards  the  real  economy,  bringing about further opportunities for our savings and retirement business.\n\nA key pillar of our strategy is to grow our pension business and to continue  to  transform  our  savings  business  mix  to  position  us  for longer-term low/negative interest rates while continuing to serve our customers' needs through the provision of attractive unit-linked and capital-light products.\n\nIn  2020,  new  business  declined  22%  overall,  due  to  the  COVID-19 crisis, in line with the French market. Unit-linked sales remained high at  \u20ac2.6  billion  (PVNBP 1 basis),  above  market  trend,  demonstrating our focus on shifting new business toward capital-light savings and Pension business, which was helped by the success of our product offers (structured/ISR/Real Estate unit-linked products) and targeted marketing campaigns.\n\nIn General Insurance, Aviva showed  stronger  than  market commercial  performance,  recording  a  4.5%  increase  in  premiums (excluding Health) collected at the end of 2020. In 2020, retention rates  increased  to  89.5%  (+1.2pp).  We  have  limited  exposure  to business interruption losses in France, this was limited to c\u00a35 million at 31 December 2020.\n\nFor  the  life  business,  our  focus  in  the  market  is  on  balancing  the demand  amongst  French  savers  for  low  volatility  guaranteed products alongside the pressure this places on return on capital in the current negative interest rate market environment.",

        "page_content": "Our market review > Manage-for-value continued\n\n## Customers\n\nThe implementation of our General Insurance strategic proposition continues  with  a  key  milestone  achieved  in  the  launch  of  'Client Unique' - a multi-channel project: one client, one product, one price, any channel; an innovative proposition allowing retail customers to choose the combination of channels that works for them. In 2020, Aviva  France  successfully  launched  the  home  product  on  a  client unique basis.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nFrance operates through a diversified distribution network: the 4th largest agent network in France (approximately 1,000 tied agents), over  1,000  active  brokers,  and  strong  capabilities  in  wealth management  through  UFF  (over  1,200  financial  advisors)  and Epargne Actuelle (1st Life broker in France). Our direct business is the second largest for General Insurance in France.\n\nFrom  a  General  Insurance  broker  perspective,  we  continue  our dynamic  of  profitable  growth  and  strengthening  our  partnerships with brokers highlighted by a 22% increase in premiums at the end of 2020.\n\n## Key priorities for 2021\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic downturn, Aviva France executes a commercial strategy focused on profitable growth based on:\n\n- \u221e Completing the disposal of Aviva France in the second half of 2021 1 ;\n- \u221e Pension business, where we are already in top three for the new individual pension product;\n- \u221e Continued effort on Life savings business transformation;\n- \u221e Customer retention; and\n- \u221e 2021 pricing strategy.\n\n## Italy\n\nIn  Italy  we  are  the  10 th largest  Life  business,  3 rd in  long-term  care (LTC), market leader in CQP and CQS 2 (credit protection of salary and pension backed loans) and 16 th General Insurance provider 3 .\n\n## Overview\n\nOur  life  product  catalogue  is  comprised  of  hybrid,  savings  and protection,  LTC  and  pension  products  distributed  mainly  through bancassurance  agreements  and  financial  advisor  networks.  We continuously  innovate  our  product  catalogue  launching  new products able to meet clients' and distributors' expectations while optimising the capital charge generated by the market volatility.\n\nOur general insurance motor business represents the primary line of business in the Italian market, and we have improved its profitability thanks to a fixing programme (established in the second half of 2017) that  reviewed  our  agency  network  to  improve  overall  profitability across  the  motor  business.  In  2020,  the  motor  business  has  been positively  impacted  by  the  restrictions  to  mobility  caused  by COVID-19  lockdown.  We  continue  to  improve  the  non-motor business, a more profitable general insurance segment which is still under-penetrated in Italy compared to other European countries. In particular, non-motor business has seen positive volume growth of 4% year-on-year.\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n## Products\n\nIn Italy, our hybrid product, a pivot of our distribution strategy in the savings business, offers customers a combination of attractive yields, stable  performance  with  a  partial  capital  guarantee  together  with protection and health riders. During the year we have consolidated on the success of the product introducing features to make the with profits component capital light. Since its launch in 2017 we have seen a compound annual growth rate of 44% to \u20ac3.1 billion (\u00a32.7 billion) demonstrating its increasing attractiveness in the market.\n\nIn general  insurance,  we  launched  a  new  Guidewire  based underwriting  platform  offering  a  simple  and  flexible  range  of products  and  we  have  been  commended  by  the  industry  for  our innovative implementation. In parallel, we commenced a review and renewal of our entire product catalogue, which will be finalised next year, and intend to extend the use of the new platform across more of  our  distribution  channels  so  that  all  our  customers  and distribution  partners  can  benefit  from  its  simplicity.  Our  General Insurance business continues with the implementation of Aviva Plus, a  new  digital  platform,  powered  by  Guidewire,  for  both  the distributors and to enhance the direct sale. Moreover, Aviva Plus will permit more efficiency and costs saving, thanks to the decommissioning of old platforms, and better analytics.\n\n## Customers\n\nOur customer base has gone up by 2% year on year, thanks to the new distributors we have started working with.\n\nWe have received strong customer feedback during the year and we are above the market average on both customer satisfaction score and retail net promoter score. The TNPS on motor and home claims demonstrate that our General Insurance claims teams are able to provide  a  full  positive  customer  experience  even  during  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe  have  achieved  important  improvements  to  our  customer segmentation analysis capabilities, which has enhanced our ability to  design  products  that  better  meet  customers'  and  distributors' demand.\n\nMoreover, we're finalising the insourcing of the contact centre with around 75% expected to be completed by the second half of 2021 and we have improved the MyAviva self-service capability.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nIn  2020  we  have  continued  with  our  strategy  to  diversify  the distribution network. We have:\n\n- \u221e Signed a new 10-year distribution agreement with Banca Patrimoni Sella, member of Banca Sella Group;\n- \u221e Extended the partnership with UBI, due to expire at the end of 2020, until June 2021;\n- \u221e Renewed the distribution agreement which expired in September 2019, with the other bancassurance partner, Unicredit, until July 2021; and\n- \u221e In  General  Insurance,  we  have  further  diversified  our  distributor mix,  concentrated  on  non-tied  agents,  especially  through  new relations with brokers. The Partnership with B&S has allowed us to become market leader in the CQP/CQS business.\n\nIn  2020  we  have  supported  all  our  distributors  to  withstand  the COVID-19 crisis and have accelerated our digitisation roadmap. To guarantee the business continuity and support our partners, we have put  in  place  a  series  of  actions  to  digitise  and  simplify  the  sales process for bancassurance partners and agents.",

Our Polish business is efficient, has  very  strong  brand  recognition,  and  through  innovation  in product development and digitisation we are in a strong position to outperform the market.\n\nWe  are  number  ten 1 in  the  General  Insurance  market  with  well diversified  distribution  channels,  including  direct  tied  agents, brokers and bancassurance partnerships with Santander and ING. We also operate in the pension and asset management markets. We are the second largest pension fund in terms of AUM 1 and fifth largest asset manager of open-ended investment funds.\n\n## Operational highlights\n\nAviva  Poland  offers  a  wide  range  of  insurance  and  investment solutions  such  as  life  cover  for  individuals  and  groups,  general insurance for retail and commercial clients, and pension schemes as well as investments through unit trusts.\n\n## Products\n\nOur personal life  portfolio  consists  of  unit-linked  insurance  with  a significant protection element. The focus of new business sales has switched  to  pure  protection  distributed  through  tied  agents  and bancassurance partnerships.\n\nIn the pension market, auto-enrolment recommenced, and we have written more than 5,100 contracts with companies employing almost half  a  million  employees  (of  which  nearly  150,000  have  joined  the pension scheme already).\n\nOur General Insurance business has experienced a stable year with strong NWP growth of 12% in commercial property.\n\n## Customers\n\nIn 2020 we have implemented a series of operational improvements and immediately responded to customer expectations regarding the COVID-19  pandemic  which  have  resulted  in  improved  customer experience metrics (TNPS) from +23 at the end of 2019 to +32 at the end of 2020.\n\nHigh and stable TNPS results on the key customer touchpoints in 2020 were maintained: +69pp after policy purchase and +51pp after claim.\n\nWe have also improved the user experience on digital touchpoints, resulting in rising TNPS result for MyAviva by 2pp and Aviva website by 36pp.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nAviva Poland has one of the largest agency networks in Poland which is the main distribution channel for the life business.\n\nOur  General  Insurance  distribution  mainly  comprises  direct  for personal offer and brokers as the dominant channel for commercial lines.\n\nWe  also  continue  to  build  on  the  strength  of  our  distribution relationship with our bancassurance partners and further digitise the\n\nsales and claims processes including self-claims in personal accident and the reporting of motor third party liability claims online.\n\nThe MyAviva platform is very well embedded in Poland and 2020 has seen us reach over 500,000 active customers, introduce a series of new functionalities, and hit over 100,000 transactions.\n\n## Key priorities for 2021\n\nWe have three priorities that will ensure successful strategy execution in 2021:\n\n- \u221e Distribution  development  -  investment  in  tied  agent  network modernisation through technology, new structure and recruitment, and deepened relationships with Santander and ING, as well as new partnerships;\n- \u221e Development  of  Aviva  brand  supported  by  customer  excellence and  digitisation  to  optimise  front  and  back  end  solutions  and customer experience across all channels; and\n- \u221e Growth across corporate business to double the size of corporate business in life and General Insurance commercial lines.\n\n## Turkey\n\nIn Turkey we have a life insurance business through our joint venture with Sabanci. We are number one in the market for pensions and the number two private  auto-enrolment  provider.  We  offer  protection products through both bancassurance and retail channels including a direct sales force.\n\nAlthough, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted new sales volumes we have consolidated our market leading position in the pensions market  by  focusing  on  improving  customer  persistency  and developing better remote sales capabilities. Our new credit linked product not only enabled us to maintain our protection market share but has also increased our profitability with increased penetration and adjusted prices. In 2020, we have also implemented customer solutions such as a mobile application and customer journeys and segment  based  services  to  provide  a  better  digitally  enabled customer experience.\n\nIn  February 2021, we announced the disposal of Aviva Turkey, see note 4(f) for further information.\n\n## China\n\nIn  China,  we  continue  to  have  an  excellent  relationship  with  our partner COFCO. In 2020 our joint venture continued to focus on its core agency channel, maintaining a team of more than 12,000 agents nationwide as of December 2020 despite severe COVID-19 disruption early in the year. Throughout the year we have performed resiliently despite  the  challenges  of  COVID-19.  This  is  as  a  result  of  our well-developed  digital  capability  which  allowed  the  business  to rapidly adapt to lockdown and digitally accept and underwrite 99.5% of new policies. We also increased the number of online users of our health platform by 320,000 in the year.\n\nOur joint venture won a number of awards this year, including two in the  China  Finance  Summit  2020  which  recognised  our  success  in brand and innovation, as well as three other awards including the Annual Impactful Joint  Venture  Insurance  Company,  Ark  Award  of Value  Growth  Insurance  Company  and  Excellent  Life  Insurance Company of the Year.\n\n## India\n\nIn India, we have a life insurance business through our joint venture with  Dabur  Invest.

        "page_content": "## Risk and risk management\n\nRisk  management  is  key  to  Aviva's  success.  We  accept  the  risks inherent  to  our  core  business  lines  of  life,  health  and  general insurance and asset management. We diversify these risks through our scale, the variety of the products and services we offer and the channels through which we sell them.\n\nWe  receive  premiums  which  we  invest  to  maximise  risk-adjusted returns,  so  that  we  can  fulfil  our  promises  to  customers  while providing a return to our shareholders.\n\nIn doing so we, have a preference for retaining those risks we believe we are capable of managing to generate a return.\n\nLooking  forward,  these  risks  may  be  magnified  or  dampened  by current and emerging external trends (including those set out in 'the external environment' section) which may impact our current and longer-term profitability and viability, in particular our ability to write profitable new business.\n\nThis includes the risk of failing to adapt our business model to take advantage  of  these  trends.  The  'Principal  risk  trends  and  causal factors'  table  in  this  section  describes  these  trends,  their  impact, future outlook and how we manage these risks.\n\n## How we manage risk\n\nRigorous and consistent risk management is embedded across the Group  through  our  Risk  Management  Framework,  comprising  our systems  of  governance,  risk  management  processes  and  risk appetite framework.\n\n## Our governance\n\nThis  includes  risk  policies  and  business  standards,  risk  oversight committees and roles and responsibilities. Line management in the business is accountable for risk management which, together with the risk function and internal audit, form our 'three lines of defence'. The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Customer,  Conduct  and Reputation Committee, Audit and Risk Committees and management's  Disclosure,  Asset  Liability  and  Operational  Risk Committees  in  relation  to  the  oversight  of  risk  management  and internal  control  is  set  out  in  the  'Directors'  and  Corporate Governance report' in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Our process\n\nThe processes  we  use  to  identify,  measure,  manage,  monitor  and report  risks,  including  the  use  of  our  risk  models,  and  stress  and scenario  testing,  are  designed  to  enable  dynamic  risk-based decision-making and effective day-to-day risk management. Having identified and measured the risks of our business, depending on our risk appetite, we either accept these risks or take action to reduce, transfer or mitigate them.\n\n## Our risk appetite framework\n\nThis refers to the risks that we select in pursuit of return on capital deployed, the risks we accept but seek to minimise and the risks we seek  to  avoid  or  transfer  to  third  parties,  including  quantitative expressions of the level of risk we can support (e.g. the amount of capital we are prepared to put at risk). In 2020, we integrated climate into our risk appetite framework - see 'Our climate-related financial disclosure' for more information.\n\nTypes of risk inherent to our business model:\n\n## Risks customers transfer to us\n\n- \u221e Life insurance risk includes longevity risk (annuity customers living longer  than  we  expect),  mortality  risk  (customers  with  life protection),  expense  risk  (the  amount  it  costs  us  to  administer policies) and persistency risk (customers lapsing or surrendering their policies).\n- \u221e General  insurance  risk  arises  from  loss  events  (fire,  flooding, windstorms, accidents etc). Health insurance exposes the Group to morbidity risk  (the  proportion  of  our  customers  falling  sick)  and medical expense inflation.\n\n## Risks arising from our investments\n\n- \u221e Credit  risks  (actual  defaults  and  market  expectation  of  defaults) create  uncertainty  in  our  ability  to  offer  a  minimum  investment return on our investments.\n- \u221e Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments when they  become  due  because  there  are  insufficient  assets  in  cash form.\n- \u221e Market  risks  result  from  fluctuations  in  asset  values,  including equity  prices,  property  prices,  foreign  exchange,  inflation  and interest rates.\n\n## Risks from our operations and other business risks\n\n- \u221e Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate  or  failed  internal  processes,  people  and  systems,  or external events including changes in the regulatory environment.\n- \u221e Asset management risk is the risk of customers redeeming funds, not investing with us, or switching funds, resulting in reduced fee income.",

The Group manages capital in conjunction with its solvency capital requirements (SCR) and in line with a new dividend policy and capital framework announced in November 2020.\n\n## Our new capital framework and priorities\n\nIn November 2020, we announced a dividend policy and capital framework that aligns with our strategy to focus on the Core markets of the UK, Ireland and Canada. At the core of our capital framework is financial strength and efficient deployment of capital.\n\n- \u221e We aim to operate a sustainable dividend policy with a level of dividend that is resilient in times of stress and is covered by capital and cash generated from the Core markets. We aim to grow our dividend per share by low to mid-single digits over time as we benefit from growth in key segments, improved efficiency as well as lower levels of debt and associated interest. As we make further progress on focusing the portfolio, this will provide further flexibility to both invest in our business and to provide additional returns to shareholders.\n- \u221e Our first priority for capital deployment is to reduce to and then maintain our Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 below 30%.\n- \u221e Once we have achieved this, to the extent that we have both excess capital above the top of our working capital range for the Solvency II shareholder cover ratio 1 of 160%-180% and excess centre cash, we will consider additional returns to shareholders.\n\n## Capital and liquidity risk appetite\n\nThe Group seeks to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity, access to a range of capital markets and significant unutilised committed credit lines. The Group's economic capital risk appetite is set in terms of our Solvency II shareholder cover ratio 1 . Our Solvency II shareholder cover ratio 1 working range is 160%-180%.\n\nOur businesses are capitalised based on their regulatory minimum levels with further prudent volatility buffers specific to each entity. Market local capital appetites and working ranges are reviewed regularly by local boards. During 2020 we took a relatively cautious approach to cash remittances 1 in the wake of the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic presents for businesses, households and customers, the uncertain impact on the global economy, and regulatory restrictions in certain markets.\n\nWe actively manage our centre liquidity 1 including stress testing our forecast cash remittances 1 and centre liquid assets in order to support our dividend and deleveraging ambitions.\n\n## Capital deployment and allocation framework\n\nThe Group's economic value-added (EVA) framework ensures that we deploy our capital based on a robust assessment of value creation. EVA is calculated as the own funds generated less the Group's cost of capital and this EVA approach is closely related to our Solvency II return on equity 1 metric.\n\nWe use EVA to support strategic decision making, such as transformation projects or merger and acquisitions, business capital allocation, pricing, hedging, reinsurance and asset allocation.\n\nWhen making capital allocation decisions in addition to EVA we consider other key metrics including cash remittances 1 , Solvency II operating capital generation (OCG) 1 and Group adjusted operating profit 2 .\n\n## Capital and cash Group Solvency position\n\nThe Group Solvency II position disclosed is based on a 'shareholder view'. The shareholder view is considered by management to be more representative  of  the  shareholders'  risk  exposure  and  the  Group's  ability  to  cover  the  SCR  with  eligible  own  funds  and  aligns  with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position. In arriving at the shareholder position, a number of adjustments are typically made to the regulatory Solvency II position.",

In Europe, we have lowered with-profits volumes protecting solvency in the low interest rate environment.\n- \u221e We maintained an active and disciplined approach to investment risk in 2020 which included reducing equity, interest rate and credit risk by changes in investment mix and additional hedging in response to the impact of the economic downturn from COVID-19.\n\n## Solvency II operating capital generation 3\n\nSolvency II OCG 3 measures the amount of Solvency II capital the Group generates from operating activities. Capital generated enhances Solvency II surplus which can be used to support sustainable cash remittances 3 from  our  business,  which in  turn  supports  the  Group's dividend as well as funding further investment to provide sustainable growth. Solvency II OCG 3 by division is summarised in the table below:\n\n| Solvency II OCG 3                    | 2020  \u00a3m   | Restated 6  2019   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------|\n| UK & Ireland Life 7                  | 1,259      | 1,248                   |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance       | 357        | 251                     |\n| Canada                               | 262        | 261                     |\n| Aviva Investors                      | 70         | 90                      |\n| Manage-for-value                     | 172        | 867                     |\n| Group centre, debt costs and Other 7 | (188)      | (458)                   |\n| Total Group Solvency II OCG 3        | 1,932      | 2,259                   |\n\nSolvency II OCG 3 decreased to \u00a31,932 million (2019: \u00a32,259 million) . Total Solvency II OCG 3 was impacted by changes made to our French life model  which  corrected  a  misapplied  rule,  and  also  benefited  from  a  lower  contribution  from  management  actions  of  \u00a3518  million (2019: \u00a3826 million) which included positive assumption changes as well as diversification benefits in Group centre and other.",

Solvency II return on equity (RoE) 1 is calculated as:\n\n- \u221e Operating own funds generation less preference dividends, DCI and tier 1 note coupons divided by;\n- \u221e Opening value of unrestricted tier 1 shareholder own funds. Unrestricted tier 1 shareholder own funds represents the highest quality tier of capital  and  includes  instruments  with  principal  loss  absorbing  features  such  as  permanence,  subordination,  undated,  absence  of redemption incentives, mandatory costs and encumbrances.\n\nSolvency II RoE 1 is used by the Group to assess performance and growth, as we look to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.

Excluding  the  impact  of  capital  actions,  non-economic  assumption  changes  and  other non-recurring items, Solvency II RoE 1 increased to 9.8% (2019: 8.1%) and Solvency II operating own funds generation increased to \u00a31,685 million (2019: \u00a31,313 million) driven by underlying improvements in UK Life, due to BPA new business, and in our UK and Canada General Insurance businesses.\n\n## Cash remittances 1\n\nThe table below reflects actual remittances 1 received by the Group from our businesses, comprising dividends and interest on internal loans.

Additionally, the Solvency II position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group's financial risk management  strategy  aims  to  manage  the  exposure  to  market  fluctuations. As  investment  markets  move  past  various  trigger  levels, management  actions  could  include  selling  investments,  changing  investment  portfolio  allocations,  adjusting  bonuses  credited  to policyholders and taking other protective action.\n\n## Solvency II regulatory own funds and Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1\n\nOne of the objectives of capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure using a combination of equity shareholders' funds, preference share capital, subordinated debt and borrowings, in a manner consistent with our risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business. The table below provides a summary of the Group's regulatory Solvency II own funds by Tier and Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 :\n\n| Regulatory view                   | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Solvency II regulatory debt       | 8,316       | 7,892      |\n| Senior notes                      | 1,112       | 1,052      |\n| Commercial paper                  | 108         | 238        |\n| Total debt                        | 9,536       | 9,182      |\n| Unrestricted Tier 1               | 20,850      | 20,377     |\n| Restricted Tier 1                 | 1,317       | 1,839      |\n| Tier 2                            | 6,740       | 5,794      |\n| Tier 3 6                          | 355         | 337        |\n| Total regulatory own funds 7      | 29,262      | 28,347     |\n| Solvency II debt leverage ratio 1 | 31%         | 31%        |\n\nSolvency II debt leverage ratio 1 remains at 31% (2019: 31%) . An increase in total debt was offset by an increase in Unrestricted Tier 1 own funds  over  2020.  The  net  increase  in  debt  was  driven  by  the  issuance  of  4.000%  \u00a3500  million  Tier  2  notes  in  June  2020  and  4.000% C$450 million Tier 2 notes in October 2020. These issuances were partially offset by redemption of the Group's 5.9021% \u00a3500 million direct capital instrument in July 2020 and a reduction in commercial paper over 2020. For details of subsequent events relating to borrowings see note 52(g).\n\n## Note that:\n\n- \u221e Unrestricted Tier 1 capital includes Aviva's ordinary share capital and share premium which are high quality instruments with principal loss absorbing features such as permanence, subordination, undated, absence of redemption incentives, mandatory costs and encumbrances.\n- \u221e Restricted Tier 1 includes preference shares and subordinated debt. None of these instruments include principal loss absorbency features and all qualify as restricted Tier 1 capital under transitional provisions.\n- \u221e Tier 2 capital consists of dated subordinated debt. The features of Tier 2 capital include subordination, a minimum duration of 10 years with no contractual opportunity to redeem within 5 years, absence of redemption incentives and mandatory costs and encumbrances.\n- \u221e Tier 3 capital consists of subordinated debt and net deferred tax assets after taking into account the ability to offset assets against deferred tax liabilities. The features of Tier 3 capital include subordination and a minimum duration of 5 years.",

        "page_content": "## Section 172 (1) statement and our stakeholders\n\n## Overview\n\nWe report here on how our directors have performed their duty under Section 172 (1) (s.172) of the Companies Act 2006. S.172 sets out a series  of  matters  to  which  the  directors  must  have  regard  to  in performing their duty to promote the success of the Company for the benefit  of  its  shareholders,  which  includes  having  regard  to  other stakeholders.  Where  this  statement  draws  upon  information contained in other sections of the Strategic report, this is signposted accordingly 1 .\n\nOur  Board  considers  it  crucial  that  the  Company  maintains  a reputation  for  high  standards  of  business  conduct.  The  Board  is responsible  for  setting,  monitoring  and  upholding  the  culture, values, standards, ethics and reputation of the Company to ensure that our obligations to our shareholders, employees, customers and others are met and Management drives the embedding of the desired culture throughout the organisation. The Board monitors adherence to  our  policies  and  compliance  with  local  corporate  governance requirements across the Group and is committed to acting where our businesses fall short of the standards we expect.\n\nOur Board is also focused on the wider social context within which our  businesses  operate,  including  those  issues  related  to  climate change which are of fundamental importance to the planet's wellbeing. A detailed explanation of how Aviva continues to manage the impact  of  its  business  on  communities  and  the  environment  is outlined  in  the  'Corporate  responsibility'  and  'Our  climate-related financial disclosure' section of the Strategic report.\n\n## Our culture\n\nOur culture is shaped by our clearly defined purpose - with you today for a better tomorrow. As the provider of financial services to millions of customers, Aviva seeks to earn their trust by acting with integrity and  a  sense  of  responsibility  at  all  times.  We  look  to  build relationships  with  all  our  stakeholders  based  on  openness  and transparency. We value diversity and inclusivity in our workforce and beyond, and the 'Our people' section of this report sets out how that underpins everything we do.\n\n## Key strategic decisions in 2020\n\nFor each matter that comes before the Board, the Board considers the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, identifies stakeholders  who  may  be  affected,  and  carefully  considers  their interests  and  any  potential  impact  as  part  of  the  decision-making process.\n\n- \u221e 2020  has  been  dominated  by  COVID-19  and  its  impact  on  our customers, our people and the communities in which we operate. For  our  customers  we  moved  quickly  to  expand  our  remote working capability to maintain strong levels of service for individual and commercial customers. We have provided extensive support for our people throughout the period of restrictions, focusing on wellbeing  and  mental  health  support,  as  well  as  practical assistance for working at home. Aviva has played a significant role in helping our communities, contributing more than \u00a340 million to support community partners. While COVID-19 has been a tragedy for public health and the global economy, Aviva has continued to demonstrate  resilience  both  in  terms  of  financial  strength  and performance.  Nonetheless,  in  the  wake  of  the  unprecedented challenges  of  COVID-19  we  announced  on  8  April  2020  the withdrawal of the recommended 2019 final dividend. This reflected the highly uncertain impact on the economy of COVID-19 and the urging  of  regulatory  authorities  publicly  to  exercise  restraint  in paying  dividends.  On  6  August  2020  at  the  Interim  Results Announcement we declared a second interim dividend for 2019. On  26  November  2020  we  provided  an  update  on  our  dividend policy and declared an interim dividend for 2020. On 4 March 2021 we declared a final dividend for 2020.\n\nAt the Interim Results Announcement we also announced that going forward  we  would  focus  on  our  strongest  businesses  in  the  UK, Ireland and Canada where we have the necessary size, capability and customer  service  capabilities  to  generate  superior  returns  for shareholders.  The  Aviva  international  businesses  in  continental Europe and Asia would be managed for long-term shareholder value, and  where  we  could  not  meet  our  strategic  objectives,  we  would withdraw capital. In addition, we announced that we must translate our  strength  in  customer  and  distribution  into  superior  financial performance for shareholders, and further strengthen our financial position in order to give the optionality to invest in our businesses and provide returns to shareholders.\n\nConsistent  with  our  strategic  priorities,  on  11  September  2020  we announced the sale of a majority shareholding in Aviva Singapore. The sale of Aviva Singapore was a first step in focusing our portfolio and  demonstrated  execution  against  our  strategic  priorities.  On 30  November  2020  we  announced  completion  of  the  transaction. During the fourth quarter we announced the sale of a major part of our Italian life business, Aviva Vita, with completion expected in the first half of 2021. We also announced completion of the disposals of our  Indonesian  joint  venture  and  our  Hong  Kong  joint  venture. Finally, on 23 February 2021, we announced the sale of our French business, and on 24 February 2021 we announced the exit from our Turkish joint venture.",

It  is  vital  that  we  build strong  working  relationships  with  our intermediaries.\n\nWe recognise the importance of contributing to our communities through volunteering, community  investment, and  long-term  partnerships.  As  a  major insurance company we are fully engaged in  building  resilience  against  the  global impact of climate change.\n\n- \u221e Our directors maintain  oversight  of  the  management of our most important suppliers  and  our  operating  subsidiary  boards  review  and  report  on  their performance.\n- \u221e All supplier-related activity is managed in line with the Group Procurement and Outsourcing  business  standard.  This  ensures  that  supply  risk  is  managed appropriately  in  relation  to  customer  outcomes,  data  security,  corporate responsibility, and financial, operational, contractual issues.\n- \u221e An  important  part  of  our  culture  is  the  promotion  of  high  legal,  ethical, environmental and employee related standards within our business and among our suppliers.

Many of our people have volunteered in support of this work including as Community Reserve Volunteers and through a Global Mapathon, to help map some of the world's  most  vulnerable  communities,  who  otherwise  could  not  easily  be reached by aid organisations in times of crisis.\n- \u221e During  2020  Aviva  significantly  increased  community  investment  in  light  of COVID-19 to support vulnerable customers and the communities in which the Company operates.  This  included  Aviva  and  the  Aviva  Foundation  donating \u00a310 million  to  the  British  Red  Cross  and  other  National  Societies  to  support communities across our markets, including the creation of a hardship fund in the UK to provide financial support to those most in need.\n- \u221e Since the end of 2018, through the Aviva Foundation, over \u00a37 million has been granted to organisations delivering public benefit projects aligned to Aviva's purpose,  values,  and  expertise.  The  Aviva  Foundation  will  continue  these investments  through  2021.  For  further  information,  see  the  'Corporate responsibility' section of this Strategic report.\n- \u221e Aviva was the first international insurer to become operationally carbon neutral in 2006 and we continue to offset 100% of any remaining operational carbon emissions.  Being  carbon  neutral  means  taking  part  in  a  carbon  offset programme which allows us to invest  in  environmental  projects  around  the world that reduce the same amount of carbon that we produce through our buildings and other operations. We are now taking our ambition a step further and  have  set  out  our  goal  to  becoming  a  Net  Zero  company  across  our operations, supply chain and investments, as part of our commitment to the UN Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance.\n- \u221e More on how the Board incorporates climate-related risks and opportunities into our governance, strategy and risk management operations is included in 'Our climate-related financial disclosure in this Strategic report.",

        "page_content": "## Our people\n\nAviva's diverse workforce includes over 28,000 colleagues, with more than 15,000 colleagues in our home market in the UK.\n\nOur  people  are  committed  to  doing  their  best  for  our  customers every day and that didn't change in 2020 despite the challenges of an exceptional  year.  Our  focus  has  been  on  keeping  them  safe  and supporting them so they can continue to look after our customers.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe  focus  of  our  global  People  teams  is  to  transform  the performance of Aviva through our people. The People strategy has been refreshed in line with our evolving business strategy and has the following aims:\n\n- \u221e Drive  a  step  change  in  accountability  and  a  more  balanced\n- performance culture with the customer at the heart of what we do. \u221e Upskilling  and  reskilling  our  people  around  the  capabilities required now and in the long-term.\n- \u221e Risk  management  embedded  in  every  employee's  role  and responsibilities.\n- \u221e Clearly defined behaviours for all our people aligned to our values that run through all our people interventions.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19\n\nIn  March,  we  began  closing  offices  across  the  globe.  We  took measures to protect our people and the operational resilience of the business  so  we  could  continue  to  provide  great  service  to  our customers.  This  included  expanding  home  working  by  increasing remote working capacity, building additional laptops, and launching new collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams. By April, around 97% of colleagues globally were working from home.\n\nWith colleagues safely at home, and customer needs continuing to be met, our focus shifted to supporting colleagues and taking the opportunity to work smarter. This included:\n\n- \u221e Regular updates clarifying any changes or Government announcements for our employees and confirming our response.\n- \u221e Increasing the frequency of leadership communications.\n- \u221e Continuing to pay colleagues who had to reduce their hours when schools or childcare were unavailable.\n- \u221e Providing physical equipment at home to anyone who needed it.\n- \u221e Introducing a smart working policy to articulate ways of working remotely that supports employees, customers and Aviva.\n- \u221e Supporting  mental  wellbeing  through  a  range  of  apps,  virtual classes and support forums.\n- \u221e Online content and training courses supporting leaders in remote leadership approaches.\n\nOnce we could begin to open our offices again, we made sure they were  COVID-19  secure  and  initially  prioritised  access  for  those employees  who  needed  to  come  in  for  their  job  or  for  health  or wellbeing reasons. Although it was not office-life as colleagues knew it, with temperature checks on arrival, one-way systems, and social distancing, feedback from those who returned was positive.\n\n## Engaging our people\n\nIn  2020  our  global  employee  opinion  survey,  the  Voice  of  Aviva, showed another solid uplift in engagement, with 80% of colleagues saying they would recommend Aviva as a great place to work. The rise was driven by stronger belief in the Aviva strategy (up 12 points) and greater trust in senior leaders (up 7 points). Our colleagues are much clearer about our plans and how they can contribute to the business' success.\n\nFeedback on Aviva's culture shows strong improvements in speed of decision-making  and  on  customer  and  risk-focused  behaviours. Three  in  four  colleagues  are  having  performance  conversations quarterly or more often. This is an important lead indicator of wider leadership  behaviour  -  listening  to,  coaching,  recognising  and supporting teams and also driving a step change in performance.\n\nThe organisation will focus on two key areas as a result of the 2020 survey.  Firstly,  providing  greater  clarity  on  the  implications  of  the organisational  strategy  on  market  and  function's  priorities  to  give colleagues  clear  direction  and  accelerate  their  performance.  And secondly, clarifying expectations around supporting and managing performance  so  colleagues  understand  what  and  how  they  are expected to deliver and their progress against that.\n\nAnother influence on engagement is colleagues feeling listened to and involved in decisions. We continue to take our responsibility to consult very seriously. We  have  positive and constructive relationships  with  trade  unions  in  all  our  markets,  as  well  as  allemployee representative bodies (for example, Your Forum in the UK). Bodies  like  Your  Forum  and  the  Evolution  Council,  hosted  by  the Chair, remain a key way of recognising that we all have a part to play in contributing to the debate on issues and opportunities impacting our people and our organisation.\n\nOur representative bodies meet regularly with members of the Group Executive Committee as well as members of their respective senior leadership  teams.  We  believe  that  by  doing  so  we  encourage  a culture of trust and open and honest communication that will help us  ensure  that  our  organisation  is  a  better  place  to  be.  In  2020, Amanda  Blanc,  Group  CEO,  also  attended  and  presented  to  the European Consultative Forum.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nWe want Aviva to be a place where people can be themselves, and we want our workforce to reflect the customers and communities we serve.  It's  a  fundamental  part  of  living  up  to  our  purpose,  key  to continuing  as  a  sustainable  and  successful  business,  and  it  helps contribute to fairer, more equal communities.\n\nWe are determined to keep challenging ourselves to do more to build a workplace - and society - that works for all.\n\nIt's  important  to  us  that  all  our  colleagues  at  Aviva  are  involved, including  those  with  visible  and  invisible  disabilities.  We  make reasonable adjustments for our people and for candidates who are interested in working for us. As a Disability Confident Employer, we will  interview  every  disabled  applicant  who  meets  the  minimum criteria  for  the  job  and  offer  Workplace  Adjustment  Passports  to colleagues.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nResponsibility > Our people continued\n\nIn  the  Voice  of  Aviva,  employees  were  asked  'if  they  can  be themselves  at  work';  84%  responded  positively,  up  2  points  from 2019. Diversity and Inclusion is woven into everything at Aviva, from inclusive  policies  to  customer  propositions,  supported  by  our engaged leadership helping to drive the changes that are needed.\n\nWe've  made  considerable  efforts  in  Diversity  and  Inclusion  (D&I), which  is  promoted  through  our  six  Global  Employee  Resource Groups,  known  as  the  Aviva  Communities,  each  sponsored  by members of the Aviva Group Executive Committee. These cover race, religion  and  social  mobility;  gender;  sexuality  and  gender  identity; caring  responsibilities;  age  and  mental  and  physical  health.  The Communities  work  collectively  so  that  we  have  an  intersectional approach to D&I. This was recognised through a number of awards in  2020  including  placing  #45  (the  only  insurer  in  the  UK)  in  the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, and appearing on the Sunday Times Top 50 Employers for Women.\n\nThe  death  of  George  Floyd  and  the  #BlackLivesMatter  campaign received  prominent  attention  at  Aviva.  The  organisation  heard directly  from  colleagues  through  safe  listening  sessions,  two-way leadership  communications  and  widespread  use  of  our  internal social media  platforms.  In  September,  Aviva  published  its BlackLivesMatter action plan on www.aviva.com and is committed to change by supporting colleagues, educating its people and acting in the wider community. Aviva are founder signatories of the CBI Race Ratio and the Canadian Black North Initiative.\n\nWe are particularly focused on two of our D&I priorities, gender and ethnicity:\n\n## Gender\n\n- \u221e At the end of 2020, Aviva had 33% female senior leadership (32% 2019).  We  will  continue  improving  senior  female  representation through initiatives such as Equal Parental Leave, targeted female development programmes and diverse short lists.\n\n## Ethnicity\n\n- \u221e In  2019, a data campaign #ThisIsMe was launched to collect the diversity  data  of  UK  colleagues.  The  completion  rate  has progressed from 10% in 2019 to 53% in 2020. The data will be used to drive evidence-based actions and help set targets for ethnicity.\n- \u221e In  early  2020,  an  ethnic  minority  leadership  programme  was piloted with 18 employees and has proved very successful. It will run as one of Aviva's leadership programmes in 2021 alongside the female leadership programme.\n- \u221e Aviva is  committed to educating all in the organisation. Notable initiatives  include  development  of  Anti-Racism  Training  and  the introduction of Reverse Mentoring with black employees and the senior executive.\n- \u221e Aviva  met  the  requirements  of  the  Parker  Report  with  the appointment of an ethnically diverse member of the board.\n- \u221e In 2020, Aviva was a founder member of the CBI, Change the Race Ratio campaign.\n- \u221e Aviva  has  published  it's  #BlackLivesMatter  action  plan  on  its website.\n\n## Health and wellbeing\n\nThe challenges  of  2020  have  shown  the  strength  of  the  Wellbeing programme at Aviva. Our colleagues' health and wellbeing continue to  be  at  the  forefront  of  decision  making  as  we  support  our customers, our people and our business.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided support to our people leaders  and  colleagues  through  two  evolving  guides  -  'Leading Virtually'  and  'Working  Virtually'  -  sharing  hints,  tips,  advice  and resources to support individuals whether they were trying to balance work and home schooling or faced lockdown living alone. Leaders were encouraged to regularly check on the wellbeing of their team to make sure that working remotely, or 'out of sight', didn't result in a loss of connection, and were provided with advice on topics such as motivation  and  isolation.  So,  while  we  may  have  been  physically distanced,  we  encouraged  our  colleagues  to  remain  socially connected.\n\nWe  have  also  been  sharing  advice  to  help  colleagues  avoid  the 'always on' culture that can surface when working from home, and with colleagues working flexible hours.\n\nWe  quickly  adapted  the  face  to  face  elements  of  our  wellbeing programme. For example, in the UK, colleagues now have access to a virtual class timetable, with over 30 free classes a week covering everything  from  mindfulness,  deep  relaxation,  stretch  and  tone  to high impact aerobics. Similarly, our seminars and talks on wellbeing topics became virtual events, with all talks recorded so colleagues can watch at a time to suit them. We created virtual challenges to help colleagues feel part of something bigger and give them a reason to focus on their wellbeing. Colleagues in Singapore even had care packages sent to their homes to replace wellbeing benefits in the office.\n\nFeedback from our people globally suggests we're getting this right. During lockdown we regularly asked our colleagues the question 'I feel Aviva is sufficiently supporting my health and wellbeing in the current environment'. The positive response to the question ranged from 84% to 87% and was broadly echoed in the subsequent Voice of Aviva survey, with 79% of our colleagues saying they felt Aviva was supporting their health and wellbeing.\n\nThe  pandemic  hasn't  been  our  only  focus,  our  wellbeing programmes have continued to evolve. In the UK for example, we have added the following support:\n\n- \u221e Domestic abuse policy and support - we've created training and guidance  for  our  leaders  and  colleagues  as  well  as  a  policy  to highlight  our  support  for  any  colleagues  who  are  suffering domestic abuse.\n- \u221e Menopause support - we've made a support app available to all colleagues, providing specialist consultation and ongoing live chat support. We also have online training which highlights the impact menopause  symptoms  can  have  in  the  workplace  and  what adjustments  can  be  made  to  support  menopausal  colleagues. These services are combined with our intranet hub of information and virtual menopause support group.\n- \u221e DigiCare+  Workplace  -  this  new  app  provides  colleagues  with access to a yearly health check (via pin prick blood test), second opinion service, digital GP, mental health and nutritionist support.",

We report on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission sources on a carbon dioxide emissions equivalents basis  (CO/two.subse)  in  respect  of  Aviva's  Group-wide  operations, as required  under  the  Companies  Act  2006  (Strategic  report  and  Directors' reports)  2013  Regulations.  We  also  refer  to  the  GHG  Protocol  Corporate Accounting  and  Reporting  Standard,  and  emission  factors  from  the  UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2019.\n\nThe table below fulfils the requirements of the UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework, including our operational energy and carbon emissions. Aviva UK uses the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) methodology for carbon reporting and non-UK markets use emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nTo date globally we have achieved a 76% reduction in CO/two.subse against our 2010 baseline (2019: 66%) . This has been aided in 2020 by the reduction in travel and operational emissions as a result of COVID-19. This means we have exceeded our 2030 carbon reduction target (of 70% against a 2010 baseline). We will now be focusing on making our operations and supply chain Net Zero.\n\nWe  have  also  offset  any  remaining  emissions  to  ensure  our  business impacts have been 'carbon neutral' since 2006. We have helped make over 1.2 million people's lives better since 2012 through our carbon offsetting projects. This includes our new long-term development project to provide clean cooking stoves in India.\n\nIn 2020, Aviva, with support from the Scottish Government, launched one of the UK's largest combined solar carports and energy storage facilities at its Perth office.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2020 Aviva  has  invested  \u00a311.7 billion  in  green  assets.  This includes \u00a37.2 billion in low-carbon infrastructure, such as wind farms and solar panels, \u00a33.2 billion in green and sustainable bonds and \u00a31.3 billion in specific climate funds.\n\nFrom  a  wider  environmental  perspective,  we  remain  committed  to reducing water use and waste levels across our offices. Having achieved zero-use of single-use plastics in all but one of our markets last year, given the need for hygienic practices with the onset of COVID-19, a small volume of single-use plastic has been reintroduced. This will be removed as soon as it is safe to do so.\n\nMore details of our environmental KPI data and our independent assurance process can be found at:\n\nwww.aviva.com/CRkpisandassurance2020.\n\n| Emissions 1,2                                                | 2020  Total   | 2020  UK   | 2019  Total   | 2019  UK   | 2018  Total   | 2018  UK   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|------------|\n| Scope 1 (tCO2e)                                              | 11,749        | 8,386      | 14,207        | 9,354      | 16,198        | 10,780     |\n| Scope 2 location-based (tCO2e)                               | 17,834        | 8,269      | 21,340        | 11,969     | 25,012        | 13,864     |\n| Total scope 1 & 2 location-based (tCO2e)                     | 29,583        | 16,655     | 35,547        | 21,323     | 41,210        | 24,644     |\n| Scope 3 (tCO2e)                                              | 5,081         | 1,910      | 14,628        | 6,516      | 17,739        | 8,761      |\n| Total location-based emissions (tCO2e)                       | 34,664        | 18,565     | 50,175        | 27,839     | 58,949        | 33,405     |\n| Carbon offsets 3  (tCO2e)                                    | (34,664)      | (18,565)   | (50,175)      | (27,839)   | (58,949)      | (33,405)   |\n| Total net emissions                                          | -             | -          | -             | -          | -             | -          |\n| Energy consumption (MWh) 4                                   | 118,472       | 73,811     | 146,562       | 90,417     | 150,421       | 96,000     |\n| Scope 2 market-based (tCO2e)                                 | 7,738         | -          | 9,370         | 192        | 11,166        | 93         |\n| Intensity ratios:                                            |               |            |               |            |               |            |\n| Scope 1 & 2 location-based emissions (tCO2e) / \u00a3 million GWP | 0.97          | 1.14       | 1.14          | 1.61       | 1.44          | 2.09       |\n| Total location-based emissions (tCO2e) / \u00a3 million GWP       | 1.14          | 1.27       | 1.61          | 2.11       | 2.06          | 2.83       |\n| Total location-based emissions (tCO2e) / employee            | 0.98          | 1.18       | 1.43          | 1.67       | 1.57          | 1.93       |\n\n- 1 Assurance on emissions figures is provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and available at www.aviva.com/CRkpisandassurance2020\n- 2 Emissions are included where Aviva has operational control, including JVs\n- 3 Carbon offsetting through the acquisition and surrender of emissions units on the voluntary and compliance markets\n- 4 Includes scope 1 and 2 energy kWh and fuel from company car use\n\n## Notes:\n\nScope 1: natural gas, fugitive emissions (leakage of gases from air conditioning and refrigeration systems), oil, and company owned cars.

More details can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Reporting Criteria 2020 on www.aviva.com/social-purpose.\n\nIn 2020 the impacts of COVID-19 were felt by our customers across the world. Aviva's markets responded with a raft of adjustments to products  and  services  to  meet  these  unexpected  needs.  This included support for Aviva UK direct, Quotemehappy and General Accident  home,  motor  and  personal  van  customers  who  were experiencing severe financial difficulties as a result of COVID-19, by deferring their monthly payments and spreading payments over the remaining term of their policies.\n\nWe  contacted  customers  who  were  within  two  years  of  their retirement  date  offering  support  and  guidance  through  market volatility and extended our existing working from home cover to our home  insurance  customers  free  of  charge.  We  also  supported businesses' shifting to home working, providing them with the same level  of  protection  whilst  they  carried  out  their  activities  from employees' homes.\n\nWe  also  put  measures  in  place  to  support  key  workers,  including extending cover for UK customers who are NHS workers to include additional breakdown, courtesy cars, priority repairs and enhanced home insurance cover at  no  additional  cost.  We  insured  personal vehicles for use in the course of healthcare work and delivery of food and  essentials  to  elderly  or  vulnerable  people  in  Ireland  and  free breakdown cover for healthcare workers in Canada. Aviva France's package of support ranged from premium and rent deferrals, to the creation of a solidarity fund for people who could not defer.\n\nDemonstrating the alignment of our climate action priority with our desire to develop products that do good, in October 2020 Aviva UK set a Net Zero carbon emissions target for its own auto-enrolment default pension funds. This is aligned to the Paris Agreement and the UK Government's own Net Zero target. Aviva is committed to making progress towards the Net Zero target as quickly as possible and has announced it is exploring the feasibility of an earlier target. In March 2021,  Aviva  announced  its  plan  to  become  a  Net  Zero  carbon emissions  company  by  2040,  which  will  help  shape  the  review  of these funds.\n\nMore generally, in order to deliver great customer outcomes, we are committed  to  helping  our  31.6  million  customers  protect  what's important to them and save for a bright future.\n\nWe know the importance of providing excellent customer service, as demonstrated through our businesses' Net Promoter Scores\u00ae (NPS\u00ae), which are our measures of customer advocacy. Seven out of seven of our  businesses  are  at  or  above  the  market  average  NPS\u00ae,  which quantifies the likelihood of a customer recommending Aviva.\n\nBut  we  know  that  we  do  not  always  get  it  right  and  we  take  any complaints and feedback we receive seriously and investigate them thoroughly.  Our  customer  service  commitment  is  reflected  in  the Customer  Experience  Business  Standard  all  our  markets  abide  by (see the policies section of www.aviva.com/social-purpose).\n\n## Building resilient communities\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  put  an  unprecedented  strain  on communities across the world. Aviva was proud to act fast by working with trusted partners to support those who needed help.\n\nGlobally as a business in 2020 we committed \u00a343 million to charitable partners to support customers and communities to face the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor example, in the UK, we pledged \u00a318.5 million for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) COVID-19 support fund, as well as \u00a35 million to  NHS Charities Together, to help fund welfare and wellbeing for NHS  employees,  volunteers  and  patients;  assistance  for  patients leaving  hospital,  and  long-term  mental  health  support  for  NHS workers.  Other  markets  also  supported  local  initiatives,  including Italy's donation of $200,000 to support the Mutual Aid Fund instituted by the Mayor of Milan, Aviva Poland's support to Warsaw University who sought materials for printing PPE, and Aviva Singapore's pledge to  support  Sayang  Sayang  Fund  to  extend  help  to  healthcare professionals  and  specific  communities  that  may  be  particularly impacted.\n\nAviva and the Aviva Foundation 1 jointly donated \u00a310 million as part of  Aviva's  award-winning  partnership  with  the  British  Red  Cross, enabling all our Aviva markets to connect with Red Cross National Societies and support their COVID-19 response projects locally. Our flagship action saw us invest to create a Hardship Fund in the UK to provide financial aid to 13,000 families and individuals most in need through  strategic  partnerships  across  the  UK,  including  those specifically  supporting  Black,  Asian  and  minority  ethnic  (BAME) communities.  Research  has  found  BAME  communities  have  been disproportionately  affected  by  COVID-19  and  you  can  learn  more about the Hardship Fund at :\n\nhttps://www.redcross.org.uk/stories/disasters-and-\n\nemergencies/uk/coronavirus-cash-grants-support-people-with-\n\ndignity.\n\nIn addition to the donations given to specifically support COVID-19 this year, we committed \u00a311.5 million to other local projects, making total community investment \u00a354.5 million in 2020. Overall, this has helped 5.1 million people (2019: 1.2 million) .\n\nThese additional community initiatives included a continuation of the Aviva Community Fund in France, Italy, the UK and Ireland. For example,  following  a  successful  pilot  in  2019,  a  new  look  Aviva Community Fund officially launched in the UK in January 2020, in partnership with Crowdfunder UK, and ran on a quarterly cycle.\n\nAviva  Canada's  Take  Back  Our  Roads  campaign,  focused  on improving  road  safety  across  the  country,  continued  in  2020  with highlights including collaborating with the City of Toronto to carry out  an  analysis  of  heavy  trucks  involved  in  serious  injuries  and fatalities over the past five years, identifying trends and helping to shape  interventions  to  address  safety  in  and  around  construction sites. A number of school-zone improvement projects are underway.\n\nOur people continue to play a vital role in our community activity, and despite the restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19, in total,  our  people  globally  have  contributed  more  than  29,200 volunteering hours to support their local communities throughout 2020. They also gave or fundraised \u00a31.8 million.",

In  2020  the  Foundation  committed  to  giving \u00a34 million to 10 non-profit organisations and social enterprises that, working  with  our  business,  can  support  our  communities  and vulnerable customers. This included funding the Financially Resilient Communities  Programme,  a  consortium  of  local  and  national charities,  working  with  communities  to  improve  financial  advice available for deprived communities.\n\n## Good governance, risk management and business ethics\n\nWe are committed to the highest standards of ethical behaviour as outlined by the Aviva Business Ethics Code 2020. This underscores our  commitment  to  operate  responsibly  and  transparently.  We require all our people, at every level, to read and sign-up to our Code every year (99% of our employees did so in 2020).\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance approach to acts of bribery and corruption. To manage this risk, we have a risk management framework which sets  policies  and  standards  across  all  markets.  These  policies  and standards apply to everyone at Aviva and it is the responsibility of CEOs (or equivalent) to ensure that their business operates in line with them.\n\nThe  Financial  Crime  Business  Standard,  and  supporting  Minimum Compliance  Standards,  guide  our  risk-based  financial  crime programmes.  These  seek  to  prevent,  detect  and  report  financial crime,  including  any  instances  of  bribery  and  corruption,  while complying fully with relevant legislation and regulation. We use riskbased  training  to  ensure  employees  and  others  acting  on  Aviva's behalf know what is expected of them and how they should manage bribery and corruption risks.\n\nAt  a  Group  level,  the  Chief  Risk  Officer  provides  Aviva's  Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee (CCRC) with regular reporting on  financial  crime  matters.  These  include  Aviva's  anti-bribery  and anti-corruption programme.\n\nOur  malpractice  helpline,  Speak  Up,  makes  it  easy  to  report  any concerns in confidence, with all reports referred to an independent investigation team. In 2020, 41 cases were reported through Speak Up (2019: 89) , with none related to bribery and corruption concerns. 25 cases reached conclusion, and 16 remain under investigation.\n\nWe  conduct  due  diligence  when  recruiting  and  engaging  external partners.  At  the  end  of  2020,  99%  of  our  UK,  Canada  and  Ireland registered suppliers have agreed to abide by our Third Party Business Code of Behaviour (or provided a satisfactory reason why they didn't do  so,  for  example,  because  they  have  their  own  existing  code  of behaviour). Our Third Party Business Code of Behaviour outlines the way in which we commit to behave in our dealings with each other and includes guidance on financial crime laws and regulations.\n\nAs part of our work with the Living Wage Foundation, we have also announced our support for the Living Hours campaign to ensure that workers  have  sufficient,  predictable  hours  and  encourage  other companies to do the same.\n\nThe  CCRC  oversees  our  responsible  and  sustainable  business strategy and the policies that underpin it. Aviva plc is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), which we aim to comply with  fully.  Kirstine  Cooper,  Group  General  Counsel  and  Company\n\nSecretary,  is  the  Aviva  Group  Executive  Committee  member responsible for corporate responsibility and sustainability, and the topic has been covered by the CCRC four times during the course of 2020, as well as twice at the Aviva plc Board.\n\nDetails of the Company's compliance with the Code, as well as the activities of the CCRC, can be found in the Directors' and Corporate Governance report in the Annual Report and Accounts and online at www.aviva.com/investors/corporate-governance.\n\nWe have assessed the environmental risks that we face as a business. The  most  significant  of  these  is  the  potential  impact  of  climate change  on  our  customers'  lives  and  our  company's  assets.  More detail can be found in the 'Risk and risk management' section and in 'Our  climate-related  financial  disclosure'  sections  of  this  Strategic report.\n\nWe also manage the risks associated with our community investment activities through the controls outlined in our overarching Corporate Responsibility  Business  Standard.  This  includes  a  governance framework for our charitable donations and partnerships and details of how we manage the risks associated with employee volunteering (for example, through safeguarding). This standard is reviewed each year and communicated to all Aviva businesses.\n\n## Our support for human rights\n\nWe are committed to respecting human rights and doing our best to make a positive impact on society whenever we can. As part of this commitment,  we  continue  to  pursue  our  anti-modern  slavery agenda  both  within  the  organisation  through  our  operations  and supply chain and  outside  of  it through  partnerships  and collaboration.  We  continually  look  for  ways  to  strengthen  our approach to addressing human rights. As part of this effort we have refreshed our group-wide human rights policy during 2020 to reflect the  most  salient  human  rights  issues  for  our  business  and stakeholders.  We  have  reflected  this  commitment  in  our  updated Aviva Business Ethics Code 2020 and our Third Party Business Code of  Behaviour,  in  which  we  set  expectations  for  third  parties  and suppliers.\n\nWithin our own operations, in 2020 we have continued work on the country-wide human rights impact assessments conducted in 2019, which  looked  at  assessing  our  markets'  risk  approach  in  areas including governance, employees, customers and investments. We have analysed the results of these assessments and created action plans and feedback sessions with all markets. To date, all markets in which  Aviva  operates  have  been  involved  in  this  work.  The assessments showed key areas to focus on to enhance Aviva's work on human rights, which included the need to create further Groupwide training on Business and Human Rights and Modern Slavery, to be delivered up to executive level.  This  training  was  subsequently developed with our partner the Slave Free Alliance to educate our staff about our commitment to human rights as well as understand the part we all play to tackle modern slavery.\n\nWe  have  also  continued  to  engage  key  suppliers  on  the  topic  of human rights and conducted modern slavery threat assessments on a range of key suppliers which were selected based on their potential modern slavery risks. In 2020 we have completed 17 assessments, including  checks  conducted  remotely  or  via  self-administered questionnaires due to the travel limitations imposed by COVID-19.",

To mark United Nations Human Rights day on the 10th of December,  we  organised  a  Human  rights  and  Modern  Slavery workshop with the Slave Free Alliance, where through role play and solving  business  dilemmas,  we  worked  with  our  people,  including key people leaders, executives, Corporate Responsibility practitioners, risk business partners, procurement and supply chain colleagues, to understand the complexities of modern slavery and human trafficking, be able to spot the signs of it and know how to respond in the event that a case is identified. We remain committed to  working  with  the  UN  Global  Compact  and  key  like-minded organisations as part of the UK Working Group on modern slavery.\n\nFinally,  we  use  our  influence  and  connections  to  bring  others together  and  enhance  the  industry's  wider  understanding  of,  and impact on human rights. Moreover, we continue to work with the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) on the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB).\n\nTo  understand  more  about  our  wider  Human  Rights  and  Modern Slavery approach please consult our modern slavery statement 1 , as well as our Human Rights Policy and the Aviva Business Ethics Code 2020, which can all be found on aviva.com.\n\n## Towards a more sustainable future\n\nAviva is not just an insurer but an investor in the economy, investing in buildings, infrastructure projects and companies around the world to help our customers save for their future.\n\nWe  do  this,  in  part,  through  Aviva  Investors  (AI),  our  global  asset management  company  with  a  heritage  in  responsible  investing dating  back  to  the  early  1970s.  We  invest  responsibly  with Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  considerations  a central  pillar  of  our  investment  process  because  we  believe  it  can minimise risk and allows us to spot opportunities for our customers. This process includes areas like climate change, biodiversity, human rights, plastics and gender diversity. Demonstrating the depth of our ESG  work,  AI  received  the  highest  grade  in  the  United  Nations Principles  of  Responsible  Investment's  (UN  PRI's)  2020  annual assessment  of  A+  for  our  ESG  strategy,  governance  and  active ownership (i.e. engagement and voting).\n\nDuring 2020 AI continued to enhance their responsible investment processes. This work has included:\n\n- \u221e Targeting \u00a310 billion of investments into UK infrastructure and real estate  projects  over  the  next  three  years,  as  pension  funds  and insurers continue to increase their appetite for such investments.\n- \u221e Embedding our responsible investment philosophy, which sets out our responsible investment commitments as a business;\n- \u221e Continuing to implement specific ESG integration policies for each of  our  investment  functions:  Credit,  Equities,  Multi-Asset  and Macro, Real Assets and Solutions;\n- \u221e Continuing the development of new products and solutions that meet  the  specific  needs  and  values  of  our  clients,  including building a Sustainable Outcomes Funds Range linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); and\n- \u221e Working with Aviva France and Aviva UK Life to design funds and solutions  for  customers  looking  to  integrate  ESG  considerations further into their investment proposition, including the AVSD 2.0 (Aviva Vie Solutions Durables) project in France.\n\nWe  also  continue  to  play  our  role  as  a  responsible  asset  owner engaging with the companies, projects and assets we own on issues such as climate change, human rights and diversity. For example, as part of Climate Action 100+, Aviva Investors co-filed a resolution at BP to provide clarity on how the company's strategy is consistent with the  goals  enshrined  in  the  Paris  Agreement.  As  a  result,  BP committed to being Net Zero for oil and gas extracted, significantly reduce carbon intensity for traded energy, and outlined a roadmap including a 40% reduction in oil and gas over the next decade while increasing new energy capex by ten times to \u00a35 billion.\n\nWe  recognise  the  need  to  encourage  change  not  just  with  the companies we invest in, but in our industry and economy as a whole. Aviva is a founder member of the United Nations Global Investors for Sustainable  Development  (GISD)  Alliance,  which  advises  global policymakers on how to generate greater investment in sustainable development.\n\nIn  October  2020,  Amanda  Blanc,  Aviva  Group  CEO,  attended  the annual GISD meeting and talked about the coalition Aviva is leading to create an International Platform for Climate Finance (the IPCF) to bridge  the  gap  between  public  financing  needs  and  large  scale private sector investment on climate change, as well as about the World  Benchmarking  Alliance  (WBA).  We  co-founded  the  WBA alongside  the  United  Nations  Foundation  and  others  to  establish public, transparent  and  authoritative  league  tables,  ranking companies  on  their  contribution  to  the  SDGs.

        "page_content": "## Our climate-related financial disclosure\n\nAs  a  leading  savings,  retirement  and  insurance  business,  our sustainability and financial strength is underpinned by an effective risk  management framework. Our business is directly impacted by the  effects  of  the  climate  crisis.  We  believe  unmitigated  climaterelated  risks  present  a  systemic  threat  to  societal  and  financial stability and to our business, over the coming decades.\n\nThis disclosure reflects Aviva's 2020 response to the recommendations  of  the  Taskforce  on  Climate-related  Financial Disclosures  (TCFD).  It  sets  out  how  Aviva  incorporates  climaterelated  risks  and  opportunities  into  governance,  strategy,  risk management, metrics  and  targets  and  how  we  are  responding  to customer expectations and regulatory requirements. These pages, along with the expanded report, are available at www.aviva.com/TCFD.\n\n## Governance\n\nAviva has a strong system of governance, with effective and robust controls. In 2020, we continued to ensure appropriate governance is in place in line with the PRA's Supervisory Statement 3/19 1 . The UK and  material  regulated  entities'  Chief  Risk  Officers  (CROs)  are responsible for ensuring climate-related risks and opportunities are identified,  measured,  monitored  and  managed  through  our  risk management framework and in line with our risk appetite.\n\nThe  Group  CRO  is  responsible  for  overseeing,  at  Group  level,  the embedding  of  this  framework.  A  Group-wide  climate-related  risks and opportunities project supports the CROs in meeting regulatory expectations. The Group CRO is the executive sponsor of the project.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  and  the  Customer,  Conduct  and  Reputation Committee (CCRC) oversee our management of climate-related risks and opportunities. In 2020, the Risk Committee met eleven times to review,  manage  and  monitor  all  aspects  of  risk  management, including climate-related risks and opportunities. The CCRC met five times  to  oversee  how  Aviva  meets  its  corporate  and  societal obligations. Papers considering the impact of climate change on our business were presented to Board committees across Aviva (e.g. a paper was presented to the Risk Committee to highlight the ways in which  climate  change  may  affect  our  business  and  to  invite  the committee's views on the actions taken and planned).\n\nIn  addition,  Aviva's  climate  risk  preference  was  reviewed  and approved by the relevant Group and local governance to allow the consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities through our risk management framework.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Plc  Board  reviewed  and  approved  the  2021-2023 business plan, which incorporates our climate metrics, operating risk limits and  tolerances.  This  allows  climate-related  risks  and opportunities  to  be  further  embedded  in  our  day-to-day  decision making in line with our wider risk appetite. In 2021, the Plc Board also reviewed and approved our new climate change plan as well as our Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance target.\n\nWe also continued developing the skills of our Boards and our people in  this  area.  As  part  of  our  regular  Board  and  senior  management training programme, Aviva's climate-related risks and opportunities, new climate change plan and Board responsibilities were presented to the Group and local Boards as relevant. This training equips our Boards to give appropriate direction to the company and ensures challenge, guidance and support are given to the executives so that actions are taken to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report these risks and opportunities. A detailed training plan is being put in place  which  envisages  at  least  annual  training  to  all  relevant employees across the organisation, with more in-depth training to those who hold direct responsibilities to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nIn  2021,  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  metrics including climate will be added to other risk metrics considered in determining senior management remuneration.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur  new  climate  change  plan  resets  the  scope  and  level  of  our climate ambition to create a broader, joined-up approach covering all material areas of our business including investments, insurance, operations, accountability and leadership.\n\nAviva is a trusted climate leader. We commit to aligning our business to the 1.5\u00b0C Paris target 2 and plan to be a Net Zero company 3 by 2040. Our  businesses  will  seek  to  develop  and  offer  further  climate conscious  products.  We  are  targeting  Net  Zero  by  2030  for  our operations and supply chain, as well as using our influence to help tackle  climate  change.  This  climate  change  plan  is  aligned  to  our Company Purpose 'With you today, for a better tomorrow' and our Group Business Strategy.\n\nInvestments -  There  are  three  ways  in  which  Aviva  is  involved  in investments i.e. as an asset owner, a long-term savings and pensions provider and as an asset manager. We seek to align our investments with  a  pathway  towards  Net  Zero  carbon  emissions  and  ensure consistency with the 1.5\u00b0C Paris target. We are setting targets for how we  will  transition  our  portfolios  and  will  publish  updates  on  our progress.  We  signed  up  to  key  global  commitments  such  as  the United Nations-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance. We target a  reduction  in  the  carbon  footprint  of  our  investments  by  25%  by 2025 and by 60% by 2030, and we aim to transition all assets 4 to Net Zero  by  2040.  We  are  also  planning  further  investments  in  green assets 5 by 2025.\n\nWe use our influence as a shareholder and an investor to engage with and encourage companies to transition to a low carbon economy. We limit our exposure to carbon intensive sectors and companies and divest from highly carbon-intensive fossil fuel companies where we  consider  they  are  not  making  sufficient  progress  towards  the engagement goals set.\n\nWe believe the highest emission fuels are not part of a low carbon future.  We  will  therefore  not  be  investing  in  or  insuring  coal (generation or mining). By the end of 2022, we will have divested all companies making more than 5% of their revenue from thermal coal unless they have signed up to Science Based Targets 6 or the funding is for ring-fenced  green  project  finance.  This  applies  to  all shareholder funds and policyholder funds where possible. We will divest the equities, put the bonds into run-off and put the companies on our Stoplist.\n\n- 1 The PRA Supervisory Statement - 'Enhancing bank's and insurers' approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change'.\n- 2 The 1.5\u00b0C target was set by the global Paris climate change deal in 2015 to limit the damage wreaked by acute events such as extreme weather and chronic events such as sea level rise.\n- 3 'Net Zero company' target covers all material 'Scopes 1, 2 and 3' carbon emissions (including investment, operations, supply chain); we are also developing a methodology for Net Zero underwriting.\n- 4 Scope of our target will be core markets, all main asset classes (credit, equities, direct real estate, and sovereigns when methodology developed this year; including both active and passive funds), and shareholder assets and those policyholder assets where we have decision making control and we have carbon emissions data.\n- 5 Low carbon infrastructure debt & equity; such as Solar photovoltaics (PV), offshore & onshore wind, new energy centres reducing users' demand for energy, waste to energy, green hydrogen generation, battery storage, low carbon public transport & electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy efficient buildings. Green bonds that meet Climate Bonds Initiative's requirements, Social bonds and Sustainability bonds, Green loans and specific climate-related funds (such as the Climate Transition fund range). To determine the scope of our green assets, we have used 'our and our customers assets' this includes all shareholder, with-profits and unit linked assets but excludes external mandates not on Aviva's balance sheet.\n- 6 Science Based Targets Initiative is a collaboration between United Nations Global Compact, CDP (a global disclosure system), World Resources Institute and Worldwide Fund for Nature. It supports companies to set emission reduction targets in line with the decarbonisation required to limit global temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C.",

        "page_content": "Responsibility > Our climate-related financial disclosure continued\n\nFurther, in line with the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) Finance Principles  we  commit  to  avoiding  exposure  to  equity  and  debt instruments  of  companies  that  plan  to  generate  electricity  from unabated coal beyond the PPCA timeframe 1 .\n\nIn April 2020, we added a further 42 thermal coal mining and power companies to our investment Stoplist and removed one which met our engagement criteria. This took the total number of companies with revenue from coal on the Stoplist to 59. We have divested any equity holdings we had in the Stoplist and expect to run-off existing fixed  income  where  there  may  be  detrimental  financial  impact  of doing so immediately.\n\nAI  aims to support the drive to make the changes needed to keep global  temperature  rise  to  1.5\u00b0C  through  its  management  of  our investments  and  active  ownership  as  set  out  in  the  AI  Corporate Governance and Voting Policy 2 . This will seek to reflect emerging best practice pathways at a country and industry level. AI also integrates sustainability risk and wider considerations of ESG factors into the investment process and launched a new Engage & Divest approach in February 2021. We believe this will deliver long-term sustainable and superior investment outcomes for customers while adhering to their mandate.\n\nAI is building out a Climate Transition Fund range that helps investors support the transition to a low carbon economy across all core asset classes. In 2020, AI launched the second Equity Climate Transition Fund. Both the European and Global funds will take a long-term, high conviction  investment  approach,  targeting  global  companies  that derive material revenues from goods and services addressing climate change  mitigation  and  adaptation  as  well  as  investing  in  those companies aligning their business models to a low carbon economy. AI Corporate Governance and Corporate Responsibility Voting Policy expects companies to report climate-related risks, strategy, policies and performance against the TCFD recommendations.\n\nWe integrate consideration of long-term sustainability issues into the products and services we offer. We continue to develop our customer ESG strategy and offer climate conscious and ethical funds such as the stewardship fund range. For example, in the UK we have added these funds as a default strategy option for our corporate pension customers. In France we offer Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) options. Both our French and UK businesses have added AI Climate Transition European Equity and Global Equity Funds to savings and investment platforms.\n\nThe  Aviva  Master  Trust  Trustees  have  made  'My  Future  Focus'  combining actively managed funds where ESG is integrated into the investment  process  and  passive  funds  with  an  ESG  tilt  -  their standard  default  solution.  In  Italy  we  have  several  sustainable investments  and  a  series  of  SRI  unit  linked  products  available. Further, in October 2020 we announced a Net Zero target for our UK auto-enrolment default pension funds.\n\nInsurance -We seek to grasp opportunities to support the transition to a low carbon economy and promote activities that will secure a better future for our customers and wider society.\n\nWe continue  to  develop  climate  conscious  products  and  services, which  reward  customers  for  environmentally  responsible  actions, provide some element of adaptation/resilience or additional cover where  possible  for  those  customers  at  risk  of  extreme  weather\n\nimpacts. For example, Aviva France has bespoke electric vehicle (EV) policies  and  reduced  premiums  for  customers  who  use  public transport.  In  the  UK,  solar  panels  on  residential  roofs  attract  no additional premium. In Canada, our partnership with Lyft makes it easier  for  customers  to  choose  car  share  journeys  and  we  offer endorsements to cover domestic solar panels and wind turbines.\n\nWhen paying out claims, we also have the opportunity to reduce our environmental  impact  through  repair  and  restoration  where possible. In the UK, our improved drying process after flood claims reduces the associated carbon emissions.\n\nAs the frequency and intensity of extreme weather increases, we have where possible been working to reduce the impact on our customers' lives,  livelihoods  and  build  resilience  to  climate  change.  We  put specific  information  in  the  media  to  help  customers  minimise  the impact of particular storms or floods.\n\nIn  the  UK  we  seek  to  proactively  communicate  with  as  many customers as possible before extreme weather events. In the UK and Canada, where appropriate we work with customers to help them become more resilient (e.g. offering coverage to install risk mitigation devices after a claim and to 'build back better'). In Canada, we were also the first insurer to announce comprehensive water coverage on property policies.\n\nWe sponsored a new code of practice for flood resilience released in January  2020 3 . The  code  covers  all  aspects  of  prevention  and resilience to make properties more resilient to flood. We have also been working with Business in the Community supporting an online tool for small business resilience - 'Would you be ready?'.\n\nWe limit our exposure to the most carbon intensive elements of the economy  through  our  Group  Underwriting  Boundaries.  These include  restrictions  on  toxic  waste  companies  that  present  a significant  hazard  to  the  environment,  and  carbon  intensive industries such as mining, offshore oil and gas extraction. At the start of  2019,  we  exited  the  standalone  operational  fossil  fuel 4 power market as part of our commitment to help tackle climate change. These  restrictions  have  been  adopted  by  our  general  insurance businesses in the UK, Ireland, Canada, France and Poland.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2019  we  took  another  important  step  in  our commitment by launching a specialist renewable energy proposition providing  insurance  solutions  for  the  full  lifecycle  of  renewable energy risks worldwide. Through this product we currently insure the largest windfarms in the USA and Africa.\n\nMore broadly, we aim to use our underwriting insight to support our investment decisions, to ensure a consistent view of climate-related risks is taken. For example, the issuers on Aviva's investment Stoplist are mirrored as exclusions in the Group Underwriting Boundaries.\n\nOperations -As a business it is important that we lead by example focusing  on  reducing  our  environmental  impact  through  energy efficiency,  clever  use  of  technology  and  communications,  using renewable energy sources and minimising the carbon intensity of our car  fleet.  Our  operations  have  been  carbon  neutral  since  2006, through  reducing  our  emissions  year-on-year  and  offsetting  any remaining emissions.  Our  ambition  over  time  is  that  our  business operations should have a positive climate impact. We have already reduced our emissions by 76% 5 .",

We  are committed to using 100% renewable electricity Group-wide by 2025 1 . In 2019, we commissioned a 'first of its kind in the UK' solar carport installation for our Norwich office.\n\nFollowing this success, in 2020 we installed a solar carport array at our Perth office. It's the biggest combination of solar, energy storage and  EV  charging  points  in  the  UK.  The  Perth  'low-carbon  hub' features  a  1.1MW  solar  carport,  integrated  with  1.8MWh  of  Tesla battery  energy  storage  and  50  EV  charging  points,  forming  the cornerstone of Aviva's ambitious drive to take the office off grid by providing 26% of the site's annual energy.\n\nThe  Corporate  Responsibility  section  includes  an  expanded  table featuring our energy use and carbon emissions data to reflect the new  requirements  of  the  UK  Streamlined  Energy  and  Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework.\n\nAccountability and Leadership We are strong advocates of the need for listed companies to publish consistent information to help make better decisions and promote the transition to Net Zero carbon emissions  by  2050.  More  accurate  information  will  help  financial institutions to manage climate-related risks and grasp opportunities to support the transition. It will also help our customers and investors understand how their money is invested and so make more informed decisions.\n\nWe  welcome  the  increased  regulatory  focus  on  this  area  and  are eager  to  see  much  wider  reporting  in  line  with  the  TCFD recommendations.  At  the  2021  Annual  General  Meeting,  we  are providing the opportunity for our own shareholders to vote on this disclosure.\n\nWe continue to provide strong and vocal support for capital market reform, to mobilise the trillions of pounds required to transition to a low  carbon  economy  and  correct  existing  market  failures  with respect to climate change. We continue to work with policymakers and regulators encouraging them to change the financial system, so that  markets  reward  sustainable  investments  and  sustainable businesses, advocating for an economic recovery driven by emission reduction and climate adaptation while also integrating biodiversity impacts  and  associated  mitigation  strategies.  In  line  with  Aviva's Marshall Plan for the Planet we are proposing that a new institutional mechanism - the International  Platform  for  Climate  Finance  -  be created at Glasgow COP26 2 .\n\nAs an employer, an active member of our local communities and with a  significant  customer  base,  we  can  amplify  individual  efforts  to create a joint  legacy  that  we  can  all  be  proud  of  (e.g.  EV  charging points for employees, car sharing support and the use of low carbon public transport for commuting), partnering with others to provide climate resilient community projects.\n\n## Risk management, metrics and targets\n\nRigorous and consistent risk management is embedded across Aviva through our risk management framework. This framework sets out how we identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on the risks to  which our business is, or could be, exposed (including climaterelated risks). In 2019, we updated our risk policies (including our risk management framework policy). In 2020, we updated our business\n\nstandards (a key component of our risk management framework) to further  integrate  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities  across  all risk and control management activities.\n\nWe integrated climate into our risk appetite framework, defined our climate risk preference and incorporated climate risks into our 20212023  business  plan,  to  facilitate  risk-based  decision-making.  Aviva considers climate change to be one of the most material long-term risks to our business model and its impacts are already being felt. Given its materiality and proximity, we are acting now to mitigate and manage  its  impacts  both  today  and  in  the  future.  Through  these actions, we continue to build resilience to climate-related transition, physical  and  liability  (litigation)  risks  including  the  risk  of  assets becoming stranded.\n\nWe have developed models and tools to  assess  and  monitor 3 the potential  impact  on  our  business  of  different  Intergovernmental Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  scenarios.  Each  IPCC  scenario describes a potential trajectory for future levels of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. These can be mapped to likely temperature rises: 1.5\u00b0C (aggressive mitigation), 2\u00b0C (strong mitigation), 3\u00b0C (some mitigation) and 4\u00b0C (business as usual). The IPCC Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C report, published in October 2018, highlights the need to take dramatic action now to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C and the potential severe consequences if this is not achieved.\n\nWe calculate a Climate Value-at-Risk (Climate VaR) for each scenario to assess the climate-related risks and opportunities under different emission projections and associated temperature pathways. A range of different financial indicators are used to assess the impact on our investments and insurance liabilities. These impacts are aggregated to  determine  the  overall  impact  across  all  scenarios  by  assigning relative likelihoods to each scenario.\n\nClimate  VaR  includes  the  financial  impact  of  transition  risks  and opportunities. This covers the projected costs of policy action related to  limiting  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  projected  profits  from green  revenues  arising  from  developing  new  technologies  and patents. In addition, it captures the financial impact of physical risks from extreme weather (e.g. flood, windstorm and tropical cyclones) and chronic effects (e.g. rising sea levels and temperature), although we recognise that the most extreme physical effects will only be felt in the second half of the century. We also recognise that there is a growing  trend  in  climate-related  litigation  and  have  assessed  its potential exposure accordingly.\n\nWe also use a variety of other metrics to identify, measure, monitor, manage  and  report  alignment  with  global  or  national  targets  on climate change mitigation and the potential financial impact on our business. While recognising the limitations of the Climate VaR and other  metrics  used  (e.g.  scope  of  coverage,  data  availability  and extended time horizons as well as the uncertainty associated with some  of  the  underlying  assumptions),  we  believe  they  are  still valuable in supporting our governance, strategy and risk management.\n\nGreen Assets -We track our green, low carbon and transition assets. The previous definition of our green assets 4 has been expanded this year to include low carbon real estate and specific climate-related funds as well as explicitly excluding external mandates.",

To achieve this, our first goal is to drive change in the companies we invest in through direct engagement. We also reserve the right to reduce our exposure to the intensive companies who are not making the transition to a low carbon economy and move capital towards those who are.\n\nPortfolio Warming Potential -We use a portfolio warming potential metric  to  assess  our  shareholder  funds'  credit,  equity,  real  estate, green  assets  and  sovereign  bond  investments  alignment  with  the Paris  Agreement  target.

Aviva  is  predominantly  exposed  to  sovereigns  from developed  markets.  We  have  no  significant  exposure  to  countries highly vulnerable to the physical effects of climate change and our exposure to moderately exposed countries is captured as part of our risk management and monitoring of sovereign risk. We also have no material exposure to sovereigns whose credit quality is reliant on oil and gas production.\n\nWeather-related  losses -We  build  the  possibility  of  extreme weather events into our pricing to ensure it is adequate and monitor actual  weather-related  losses  versus  expected  weather  losses  by business (net of reinsurance). Catastrophic event model results are supplemented by in-house disaster scenarios. Our general insurance business  exposure  is  limited  by  being  predominantly  in  Northern Europe and Canada. We require our general insurance businesses to protect against all large, single catastrophe events in line with local regulatory requirements, or where none exist, to at least a 1-in-250year event.\n\nWe fully  expect  existing  frameworks,  tools  and  metrics  will  evolve over  time  and  improve  in  the  light  of  new  research,  data  and emerging best practice. To this end, we are working collaboratively with  the  UN  Environment  Programme  Finance  Initiative,  peers, academics,  professional  bodies,  regulators,  governments  and international agencies to build robust, comprehensive and effective tools  and  approaches.  These  will  enable  the  potential  business impacts  of  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities  to  be  assessed and promote more informed understanding of climate-related risks and  opportunities  by  investors,  lenders,  insurance  underwriters, investment managers and others.\n\n- 4 In 2019, the methodology was based on scope 1 emissions.",

The  COVID-19  pandemic  changed how  many  of  us  worked  during  2020,  and  the  Aviva  Board  was  no different. We had to find new ways of working to continue governing the Group for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and our people.\n\nFor  the  Aviva  Board  this  has  resulted  in  tangible  changes.  We  met remotely  and  more  frequently  to  understand  and  consider  how  the pandemic was affecting our business operations, our risk  and  control environment and the markets in which we operate. Our people moved to homeworking, as did many of our customers, and our businesses had to  adapt.  We  monitored  the  financial  markets'  response  to  the pandemic, and the impact of those market movements on Aviva. Despite this  our  operational  and  financial  strength  has  meant  that  we  have continued to be there for our customers.\n\nWhile  2020  has  been  a  challenging  year  operationally,  the  Board continued to focus on our strategy and how we deliver sustainable, longterm  growth  for  our  shareholders.  Following  the  appointment  of Amanda Blanc as Group CEO, we have reset our strategy to focus on our three core markets - the UK, Ireland and Canada - and we are focused on transforming our performance and ensuring our financial strength. The Board played a key role in providing challenge and input into the new  strategy  to  ensure  that  the  strategy  promotes  the  long-term sustainable success of the Company, generates value for shareholders and contributes to wider society. The pandemic will not last forever, and the Board has continued to set aside time to look to the future and not just focus on the challenges of today, and our strategy will support Aviva in the challenges we face in the years ahead.\n\n## Board Changes\n\nThe Board has seen several changes during the year. Sir Adrian Montague retired as Non-Executive Chair on 27 May 2020 and retired from the Board on 31 May 2020 after eight years on the Board (six as Chairman). I was appointed  Non-Executive  Chair  on  27  May  2020.  Following  my appointment  as  Chair,  Patrick  Flynn  was  appointed  as  Senior Independent Director, on 7 September 2020.\n\nOn  6  July  2020  the  Board  appointed  Amanda  Blanc  as  Group  CEO following  Maurice  Tulloch's  decision  to  step  down  from  the  Board. Maurice first  joined  Aviva  in  1992,  and  was  appointed  to  the  Board  in 2017, before becoming Group CEO in March 2019. I would like to thank both Sir Adrian and Maurice for their contribution to Aviva over the years.\n\nWith the appointment of Amanda and me to the Group CEO and Chair roles respectively, we needed to replenish the Board membership. On 1 December  2020,  Mohit  Joshi  and  Jim  McConville  were  appointed  as Independent Non-Executive Directors, with Jim also becoming Chair of the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee. Subsequently on 1 January 2021, Pippa Lambert also joined the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Jim, Mohit and Pippa are great additions to the Board, and I look forward to working with them. Details of the search and selection process for all these appointments are set out in the Directors' and Corporate Governance report.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThe Board is committed to having a diverse and inclusive membership which provides a range of perspectives and insights and the challenge needed to support good decision making. I am pleased that the Board meets  the  Parker  Review  target  to  have  at  least  one  director  from  an ethnic  minority  background  and  that  women  make  up  40%  of  the current Board. More information on diversity is set out in the Directors'\n\nand Corporate Governance report and the Nomination and Governance Committee report.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe  Board  assesses  and  monitors  the  Group  culture.  To  support  the Board, a culture diagnostic has been developed, to provide the Board with  broader  data  on  our  culture.  The  culture  diagnostic  combines employee sentiment with other employee and customer data to focus on four cultural characteristics: customer focus; accountability; safe to speak up and diversity of thought. This culture diagnostic is in addition to our 'Voice of Aviva' employee survey and provides insight on progress on culture measures and comparison to our peers. Action plans have been developed from the culture data and the Board tracks progress against these actions.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Aviva dividend is of course important to our shareholders, but on 8 April 2020, we announced the decision to withdraw the recommendation  to  pay  the  2019  final  dividend  to  ordinary shareholders. This decision was taken in the wake of the unprecedented challenges  presented  by  COVID-19  and  our  regulators  and  other supervisory  bodies  urging  restraint  on  dividend  payments.  The  Board continued  to  keep  the  dividend  under  review  as  the  year  progressed, both in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic and our strategy to focus on our businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada, and was pleased to declare a 2019 second interim dividend of 6.0p on 6 August 2020. On 26 November 2020  we  announced  a  new  dividend  policy  and  capital  framework supported by the capital and cash generated in the core markets and a 2020 interim dividend of 7.0p. Then in March 2021, we announced a final 2020 dividend of 14p. The Board believes that the dividend policy and capital framework announced is sustainable and will be resilient in times of stress.\n\n## Preference Shares\n\nOn 26 October 2020 the FCA published the outcome of its investigation into Aviva's announcement on preference shares made in March 2018. The FCA found that Aviva contravened certain provisions of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules by failing to take reasonable care to ensure that information in the announcement was not misleading and did not omit anything likely to affect the import of  the  information  in  the  announcement.  We  have  accepted  the  FCA decision and lessons have been learned. We are sorry for the uncertainty created  by  the  March  2018  announcement  and  in  July  2018  set  up  a discretionary goodwill scheme for impacted Preference Shareholders.\n\nFollowing the outcome, a committee of the Board instructed Allen & Overy LLP to conduct a review of the remuneration decisions that had previously been taken in light of the preference shares matter. The review concluded that the adjustments the Remuneration Committee decided to apply to the  relevant  executive  directors'  variable  remuneration,  which  we announced in 2019, were reasonable in the circumstances and that these adjustments were applied after careful and thorough consideration by the Committee. The review also confirmed that, taking into account the FCA's decision, there was no basis for further adjustments to be made to either the executive or non-executive directors. Further detail is provided in the Directors' Remuneration report.\n\n## Code Compliance\n\nWe have complied with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) throughout the year, other than for a short period with provision 12 of the Code, when there was a period between the appointment of a new  Senior  Independent  Director  and  when  I  became  Chair.  A  full explanation  is  provided  in  the  Directors'  and  Corporate  Governance report. We set out how we have applied the principles of the Code in the Directors' and Corporate Governance report and describe how we have performed our duties under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 within the Strategic report.\n\n## George Culmer\n\n3 March 2021\n\nChair",

The Code is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk. Details of how we have applied  the  principles  of  and  complied  with  the  provisions  of  the Code  during  2020  are  set  out  in  this  report  and  the  Directors' Remuneration report. The Board can confirm that the Company was compliant with the Code throughout the financial year under review, other  than  for  a  short  period  between  the  appointment  of  a  new Senior Independent Director and when George Culmer, the previous Senior Independent Director, became Chair.\n\nThe Strategic report discloses information on our engagement with our employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders. In line with  the  Companies  Act  2006  Regulations,  further  information  on how the directors have performed their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 is also contained in the Strategic report.\n\n## Changes to the Board\n\nThere were several changes to the Board during 2020.

In the period between George Culmer becoming Chair, and the formal appointment of Patrick as Senior Independent Director, Patrick was available to act as an intermediary between the Board members or shareholders, and Chair as required.

He is also a Non-Executive Director of NatWest Group plc. Patrick is Chair of the Audit Committee and is a member of the Risk, Remuneration and Nomination and Governance Committees.\n\n## The Board\n\nAs  at  the  date  of  this  report  the  Board  is  comprised  of  the Non-Executive Chair, two Executive Directors and seven independent Non-Executive Directors (NEDs). Details of the role of the Board and its committees are described in this report. The duties of the Board and of each of its committees are set out in the respective Terms of Reference. Our committees' Terms of Reference can be found on the Company's  website  at  www.aviva.com/committees  and  are  also available on request from the Group Company Secretary. The Terms of  Reference  list  both  matters  that  are  specifically  reserved  for decision by our Board and those matters that must be reported to it. The  Board  delegates  clearly  defined  responsibilities to its committees  and  reports  from  the  Audit;  Customer,  Conduct  and Reputation; Nomination and Governance; and Risk Committees are contained in this report. A report from the Remuneration Committee is included in the Directors' Remuneration report.\n\n## Board diversity and inclusion\n\nDiversity at Aviva includes, but is not limited to, gender and ethnicity, and  is  inclusive  of  all  strands  of  diversity  including  skills  and experience, geographic and social background, disability and sexual orientation. Supporting and embracing diversity and inclusion, and valuing difference, are integral parts of our culture. The ways in which we seek to put into practice these values are set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Statement, which supports our Nomination and Governance Committee's approach to succession planning. This is  closely  linked  to  our  Group-wide  Global  Inclusion  and  Diversity Strategy (Diversity Strategy), which sets out how we implement our policies  to  increase  diversity  and  inclusion  throughout  the  Group. Board  diversity  is  monitored  by  the  Nomination  and  Governance Committee  which  reviews  the  balance  of  skills,  knowledge, experience  and  diversity  of  the  Board  and  leads  on  succession planning  for  appointments  to  the  Board  and  the  senior  executive team. Our Board skills matrix supports this approach enabling us to map the range of diversity of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board and link these to our strategy.",

This  outlines  how  the  Board  has engaged with our principal stakeholder groups. The Board considers stakeholder engagement, including engagement with our workforce to be a matter of strategic importance.\n\n## Board appointments\n\nOur Non-Executive Directors played a principal role in the process to appoint George Culmer as Non-Executive Chair and Amanda Blanc as  Group  CEO,  and  in  the  appointment  of  three  Non-Executive Directors  through  their  membership  of  the  Nomination  and Governance  Committee.  MWM  Consulting  (MWM)  undertook  the search and selection processes for the Board Chair, Non-Executive Directors  and  Group  CEO  but  had  no  other  connections  with  the Company  or  any  individual  director.  In  line  with  our  succession planning  processes,  and  led  by  the  Nomination  and  Governance Committee, we undertake a formal, rigorous and transparent search process for  each  appointment, considering the current balance of skills, experience  and  diversity  amongst  our  directors.  Each appointment is made subject to receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals. Furthermore, the continuation of each Board appointment is also subject to the annual board effectiveness review to  confirm  that  each  director's  performance  continues  to  be satisfactory.  In  accordance  with  the  Code  and  our  articles  of association, all serving directors must retire and those who wish to continue  in  office  must  stand  for  election  or  re-election  by  our shareholders at each Annual General Meeting (AGM). All directors in office at the time of the 2020 AGM were elected or re-elected in 2020.\n\n## Board and committee structure\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for promoting the long-term, sustainable  success  of  the  Company  through  delivering  excellent outcomes  for  our  customers,  seeking  to  generate  value  for shareholders while fulfilling our responsibilities to our stakeholders and contributing positively to the societies in which we operate.\n\nOne of the Board's key roles is to determine our shared purpose and to  set  and  uphold the Group's values, standards and ethics which combine to create our corporate culture. We recognise that there is a clear link between our culture and our conduct, both with regards to our customers and to the way in which governance operates in the Group,  and  our  policies,  processes  and  behaviours  in  relation  to these issues are closely monitored by the Board. The Board is also responsible for setting the Group's risk appetite and monitoring the operation of our control's frameworks. It also seeks to maintain an appropriate dialogue with shareholders on strategy and remuneration.\n\nIn order to ensure there is a clear division of responsibilities between the running of the Board and the running of the business, the Board has identified certain 'reserved matters' for its approval. In relation to all other matters, unless they are specifically reserved for shareholder approval in a general meeting, the Board delegates responsibility for these  to  our  Group  CEO,  who  then  delegates  responsibility  for specific operations to members of the Group Executive Committee (ExCo),  comprised  of  our  most  senior  managers  from  across  the business.\n\nThe Board has established certain principal committees to assist in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, providing dedicated focus on the areas set out below. Each committee chair reports to the Board on the committee's activities after each meeting. Full details of the responsibilities  of  the  Board  committees  are  set  out  later  in  this report and in the Directors' Remuneration report.\n\nDuring 2020 certain amendments were made to the structure and defined responsibilities of our suite of Board committees. To further align with our strategic priority to transform customer experiences and provide excellent value for money, the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee was designated as a sub-committee of the Risk Committee. This is also aligned to our purpose to ensure our actions in every part of the business are fully focused on consistently earning customers' trust as the best place to save, retire and insure.\n\nThe new remits of the Committees are outlined below.\n\n## Committees' purpose\n\n| Name of Committee                           | Committee Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Nomination and Governance  Committee        | Assists the Board in its oversight of Board composition; Board and senior executive succession; talent  development; diversity and inclusion initiatives; operation of the Group governance framework; and  Aviva's subsidiary governance principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Risk Committee                              | Assists the Board in its oversight of risk by assessing the effectiveness of the Group's Risk Management  Framework, risk strategy, risk appetite and risk profile;  the  methodology used in determining the  Group's capital requirements and stress testing these requirements; assessing the adequacy of the  Group's system of non-financial reporting controls; ensuring due diligence appraisals are carried out  on  strategic  or  significant  transactions;  and  monitoring  cyber  strategy  and  compliance  with  prudential regulatory requirements.

        "page_content": "Directors' and Corporate Governance report continued\n\n## Board independence\n\nDuring  the  year  the  Nomination  and  Governance  Committee assessed the independence of the Non-Executive Directors to ensure that  they  are  able  to  properly  fulfil  their  roles  on  the  Board  and provide  constructive  challenge  to  the  Executive  Directors.  The independence criteria set out in the Code were taken into account as part of the selection process for the three Non-Executive Directors who joined Aviva during 2020 and 2021.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Committee  determined  that  all  Non-Executive Directors were free from any relationship or circumstances that could affect, or appear to affect, their independent judgement. In line with the Code, over half of our Board members, excluding the Chair, are independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nIt is vital to the proper functioning of our Board and committees that each Non-Executive Director is able to commit sufficient time to their role in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. In January 2020  the  Nomination  and  Governance  Committee  assessed  the Non-Executive  Directors'  time  commitment  considering  both  the time required for Aviva Board and committee appointments and the number  and  nature  of  the  directors'  external  commitments.  All Non-Executive  Directors  have  demonstrated  they  have  sufficient time to devote to their present role within Aviva, including during any potential  periods  of  corporate  stress.  George  Culmer  became  a Non-Executive  Director  of  Rolls  Royce  plc  on  2  January  2020  and Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda became a Non-Executive Director of Bolsas y Mercados  Espa\u00f1oles  on  30  July  2020.  The  time  commitment  and potential conflicts  involved  were  assessed  by  the  Nomination  and Governance Committee which determined that George and Bel\u00e9n had  sufficient  time  to  commit  to  the  Aviva  Board  and  committee appointments.\n\nThe Senior Independent  Director (SID) reviewed the time commitment of the Chair.\n\nAccording to the Board's policy, Executive Directors may hold one external directorship, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Board. Amanda Blanc is Chair of the Welsh Professional Rugby Board. No other appointments are held.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company's Articles of  Association  allow  the  Board  to  authorise  potential  conflicts  of interest that may arise and to impose such limits or conditions as are necessary. The decision to authorise a conflict of interest can only be made by non-conflicted directors (those who have no interest in the matter being considered) and in making such a decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company's success for the benefit of its shareholders as a  whole.  The  Board  continues  to  monitor  and  note  any  potential conflicts of interest that each Director may have and recommends to the  Board  whether  these  should  be  authorised  and  whether conditions  should  be  attached  to  any  such  authorisation.  The directors  are  regularly  reminded  of  their  continuing  obligations  in relation to conflicts and are required annually to review and confirm their external interests, which helps to determine whether they can continue to be considered independent.\n\n## Independent advice\n\nAll  directors  have  access  to  the  advice  and  services  of  the  Group Company Secretary in relation to the discharge of their duties on the Board and any committees they serve on. Furthermore, any directors may  take  independent  professional  advice  at  the  Company's expense. During the year, no directors sought to do so.\n\nindemnities  with  its  directors  as  described  in  the  'Other  Statutory Information' section in this report.\n\n## Role profiles\n\nConsistent with the Code and the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR), role profiles for the Non-Executive Chair, SID, Group CEO and Non-Executive Directors are all available at www.aviva.com/about-us/roles.\n\nThe  Non-Executive  Chair  is  tasked  with  leadership  of  the  Board, setting its agenda and ensuring its effectiveness, and enabling the constructive challenge of the performance and strategic plans of the Executive Directors by the Non-Executive Directors. The Chair also plays a key role in working with the Board to establish our culture, purpose and values. The Group CEO is the senior executive of the Company and has overall accountability for the development and execution of the Group's overall strategy in line with the policies and objectives agreed by the Board.\n\nThe role of the SID is to provide a sounding board for the Chair and to serve as an intermediary for the other directors where necessary. The  SID  should  be  available  to  shareholders  should  they  have concerns they have been unable to resolve through normal channels, or when such channels would be inappropriate.\n\nThroughout the year the Chair held meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without management present. Additionally, Patrick Flynn as  SID  met  with  other  Non-Executive  Directors  without  the  Chair present to discuss any matters which they wished to raise.\n\n## Induction, training and development\n\nA  commitment  to  support  the  continuing  development  of  all employees is a central part of Aviva's culture. Our directors are highly supportive  of  this  and  are  committed  to  their  own  ongoing professional development. During 2020, the directors participated in internal  training  sessions  on  subjects  including  our  risk  appetite, climate change and directors' duties. Further training sessions have been incorporated into the Board and Committee plans for 2021. The Board  also  receives  regular  briefings  on  a  range  of  strategically important matters to ensure they are informed of developments in these areas.\n\nA  structured  and  tailored  induction  programme  was  prepared  for each  of  our  three  new  Non-Executive  Directors  appointed.  This covered,  amongst  other  matters,  the  current  strategic  and operational  plan;  meeting  packs  and  minutes  from  recent  board meetings; stakeholder engagement; organisation structure charts; a history  of  the  Group;  role  profiles;  and  all  relevant  policies, procedures  and  other  governance  material.  The  induction  also included  meeting  key  members  of  the  management  team.  Any knowledge  or  skill  enhancements  identified  during  the  directors' regulatory  application  process  would  also  be  addressed  through their induction programme.\n\n## Board calendar\n\nDuring 2020, 28 Board meetings were held, of which thirteen were scheduled meetings and fifteen were additional meetings called at short  notice.  The  additional  meetings  were  primarily  called  to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Board delegated responsibility for certain items to specially created Board committees, which met nine times to discuss these particular items.\n\nIf any  Directors  are  unable  to  attend  a  meeting,  they  can communicate their opinions and comments on the matters to be considered  via  the  Chair  of  the  Board  or  the  relevant  committee chair.\n\nThe  Company  arranges  appropriate  insurance  cover  in  respect  of legal  actions  against  its  directors  and  has  also  entered  into",

As a consequence, the Board met remotely and more frequently,  initially  weekly,  to  understand  and  consider  how  the pandemic was affecting our business operations, our risk and control environment  and  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  The  Board monitored the move of our people to homeworking, the operational challenges  that  presented,  the  financial  markets'  response  to  the pandemic and the impact of those market moves on Aviva.\n\nWhile 2020 was a challenging year operationally, the Board continued to focus on our strategy and how we deliver sustainable, long-term growth for our shareholders. Following the appointment of Amanda Blanc as Group CEO, we have reset our strategy to focus on our three core markets - the UK, Ireland and Canada - and we are focused on transforming  our  performance  and  ensuring  our  financial  strength. The Board played a key role in providing challenge and input into the new  strategy  to  ensure  that  the  strategy  promotes  the  long-term sustainable success of the Company, generates value for shareholders and contributes to wider society. The pandemic will not last forever, and the Board has continued to set aside time to look to the  future  and  not  just  focus  on  the  challenges  of  today,  and  our strategy  will  support  Aviva  in  the  challenges  we  face  in  the  years ahead.\n\nA  new  dividend  policy  and  capital  framework  was  put  in  place  on 26 November 2020 aligned with Aviva's strategic priorities. As we focus the  portfolio,  we  expect  to  build  excess  capital  over  time.  We  will deliver further value to shareholders by returning excess capital above 180% Solvency II shareholder cover ratio 1 , once our Solvency II debt leverage target ratio 1 has been reached. The Board expects to exceed the original target of \u00a31.5 billion debt deleveraging by the end of 2022.\n\nWe understand that our financial plans can only be achieved through being with people when it really matters, throughout their lives - to help them make the most of life. Looking after our customers, people and  wider  community  has  been  a  priority  for  Aviva  during  the ongoing pandemic. The Board met 28 times during the year, focusing on Aviva's customers and assessing the impact of COVID-19 on them, in addition to revising the strategic priorities for the Aviva Group.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board's agenda will focus on driving delivery of the Group's strategic priorities.\n\nWe will seek to ensure that we successfully simplify Aviva's portfolio, transform our performance and improve our efficiency. The Board will closely monitor and drive enhancements in our risk and control environment and will continue to assess and respond to changes in the uncertain external economic and social environment; including those related to the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The Board will seek to  ensure  that  as  a  business,  we  maintain  our  focus  on  managing operational resilience and potential risks around our IT estate. We will closely review our progress towards meeting the financial targets outlined in our strategic update in November 2020 which will support our  new  dividend  policy  and  capital  framework  and  our  goal  of delivering further value to shareholders. Our Board strategy session in June 2021 will be used to review our three-year strategic plan and to set out strategic priorities for the year ahead.\n\nCulture will also remain a key area, and we will continue to engage with our stakeholders and integrate their interests and concerns into our  decision-making  processes.  Succession  planning  and  the continued  development  of  the  talent  pipeline  will  also  remain  an area of focus for both the Board and the Nomination and Governance Committee.",

The Board undertakes a rigorous evaluation process each year to assess how it, its committees and individual directors are performing. The Board decided that the 2020 evaluation be undertaken through an internal questionnaire prepared in conjunction with Lintstock, with the  outcomes  reported  in  January  2021.  Lintstock  also  provides evaluations to other operating subsidiaries in the Aviva Group.\n\nLintstock is an independent provider of Board evaluations and has no  other  connection  with  Aviva  or  any  individual  director.  The questionnaires covered  a  variety of areas including board composition, strategic and operational oversight, risk management and internal controls, and culture. The Board considered the final report  and  the  recommendations  which  were  shared  with  each committee, and an action plan for areas of focus was agreed. The 2019 Board evaluations and 2020 actions are outlined in the table below.\n\n## Outcomes from the 2019 Board evaluation and steps taken in 2020\n\n| Focus area                       | Theme                                                                                       | Feedback/actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strategy oversight               | Enhanced  information  to  support  the  Board's  strategy  implementation activities       | The Board's reporting schedule was revised to increase the frequency of Strategy  and Transformation agenda items. These changes supported the Board with its  discussion of strategic matters and early input into associated proposals during the  strategic review. The Board created a Group Chief Operating Officer (COO) role with  responsibility  for  supporting  strategy  implementation  and  providing  associated  updates to the Board.                                                                   |\n| Performance  reporting           | Developing and enhancing the  information the Board receives  on key performance Indicators | We made certain changes to the performance reporting received by the Board,  including  the  introduction  of  more  granular  market  reporting  and  external  perspectives and benchmarks. These changes further support the Board's insight  into potential issues facing our operating subsidiaries in their markets.                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Subsidiary  operations oversight | Review  the  breadth  of  the  Board's oversight of subsidiary  operations                  | A framework has been implemented that reinforces the engagement of the Board's  Non-Executive  Directors  with  the  chairs  of  subsidiary  boards.  The  chairs  of  key  subsidiary  entities  have  become  standing  attendees  at  Board  meetings  further  enhancing  the  flow  of  information  between  the  Board  and  subsidiaries.  The  Group's Subsidiary Governance Principles were also enhanced to include greater  focus on items for escalation from the subsidiary boards to the Aviva plc Board. |\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nAs part of the Board effectiveness review process, each committee considers  the  feedback  from  the  Board  evaluation  exercise  and develops an action plan as appropriate.\n\n## Frameworks for risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of shareholders, as well as taking account of other  stakeholders  including  employees  and  customers.  This includes ensuring that an appropriate system of risk governance is in place  throughout  the  Group.  To  discharge  this  responsibility,  the Board has established frameworks for risk management and internal control using a 'three lines of defence' model and reserves for itself the setting of the Group's risk appetite. Further details are contained on the following pages.\n\nIn-depth monitoring of the establishment and operation of prudent and effective controls in order to assess and manage risks associated with  the  Group's  operations  is  delegated  to  the  Risk,  Customer, Conduct  and  Reputation  and  Audit  Committees  which  report regularly  to  the  Board.  However,  the  Board  retains  ultimate responsibility  for  the  Group's  systems  of  internal  control  and  risk management and has reviewed their effectiveness for the year. The frameworks for risk management and internal control play a key role in  the  management of  risks  that  may  impact  the  fulfilment  of  the Board's objectives. They are designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of the Group failing to achieve its business objectives  and  can  only  provide  reasonable  and  not  absolute assurance against material misstatement and loss. The frameworks are regularly reviewed and were in place for the financial year under review and up to the date of this report.\n\nThey help ensure the Group complies with the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) guidance on Risk Management, Internal Controls and Related Financial and Business Reporting.\n\nA robust assessment was conducted by the Board of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including those that could impact the Group's business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity.\n\nThe Company's approach to risk and risk management together with the principal risks that face the Group are explained within the Risk and risk management section of this report.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nThe  Risk  Management  Framework  (RMF)  is  designed  to  identify, measure,  manage,  monitor  and  report  the  principal  risks  to  the achievement of the Group's business objectives and is embedded throughout  the  Group.  It  is  codified  through  risk  policies  and business  standards  which  set  out  the  risk  strategy,  appetite, framework and minimum requirements and controls for the Group's worldwide operations. Further detail is set out in note 59.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nInternal  controls  facilitate  effective  and  efficient  operations,  the development  of  robust  and  reliable  internal  reporting  and compliance with laws and regulations. Group reporting manuals in relation  to  IFRS  and  Solvency  II  reporting  requirements  and  a Financial  Reporting  Control  Framework  (FRCF)  are  in  place  across the Group. The FRCF relates to the preparation of reliable financial reporting, covering both IFRS and Solvency II reporting activity.",

Aviva's  successful  response  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic has also been used to inform the Group's preparation for the  forthcoming  Operational  Resilience  regulation  for  which enhancements to Aviva's Operational Risk Management Framework have been made (going live in 2021), alongside the categorisation and  resilience  prioritisation  of  its  important  business  services. Further  analysis  and  testing  of  Aviva's  most  important  business services  will  take  place  during  2021.  Further  information  can  be found in the Audit and Risk Committee reports.\n\n## First line - management monitoring\n\nThe Group Executive Committee and each market Chief Executive Officer  are  responsible  for  the  application  of  the  RMF,  for implementing and monitoring the operation of the system of internal control and for providing assurance to the Audit, Customer Conduct and Reputation and Risk Committees and the Board.\n\n## Second line - risk management, compliance and actuarial functions\n\nThe Risk Management function is accountable for the quantitative and  qualitative  oversight  and  challenge  of  the  identification, measurement,  monitoring  and  reporting  of  principal  risks  and  for developing the RMF.\n\nThe Actuarial function is accountable for the Group-wide actuarial methodology,  reporting  to  the  relevant  governing  body  on  the adequacy  of  reserves  and  the  appropriateness  of  the  Solvency  II internal model, as well as underwriting and reinsurance arrangements. The Compliance function supports and advises the business on the identification, measurement and management of its regulatory,  financial  crime  and  conduct  risks.  It  is  accountable  for maintaining the compliance standards and framework within which the Group operates and monitoring and reporting on its compliance risk profile.\n\n## Third line - internal audit\n\nThe  third  line  of  defence  is  Internal  Audit.  This  function  provides independent and objective assessment on the robustness of the RMF and the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control to the Audit,  Customer,  Conduct  and  Reputation  and  Risk  Committees, market audit committees and the Board.

The  Chair  met  several  of  the  Group's major shareholders during 2020. At these meetings a range of issues were discussed within the constraints of information already made public, to understand shareholders' perspectives. On 26 November 2020 we streamed a presentation to update investors and analysts on our strategy and financial objectives in conjunction with our third quarter announcement. Shareholders' views are regularly communicated to the Board through the Group CEO's, and Group Chief  Financial  Officer's  reports  and  weekly  briefings  from  the corporate brokers and the Investor Relations function.

The AGM provides a valuable opportunity for the Board to communicate with private  shareholders.  Shareholders  are  invited  to  ask  questions related to the business of the meeting at the AGM and a presentation will be given on the Group's performance. Further details on the AGM are provided in the Shareholder Services section of this report.\n\nDue to the  restrictions  associated  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  it was not possible to hold our usual AGM arrangements for the 2020 AGM,  but  we  filmed  an  event  with  the  Chair  and  Group  CEO answering  questions  submitted  by  shareholders  to  ensure  our engagement with shareholders continued as far as possible in the circumstances.",

The  Committee  also  led  the  process  for  the appointment of Mohit Joshi, Jim McConville and Pippa Lambert as Independent  Non-Executive  Directors.  Mohit  Joshi  and  Jim McConville joined the Board on 1 December 2020 and Pippa Lambert joined on 1 January 2021. The Committee also considered a range of governance matters, including the implementation and embedding of the Group Governance Framework for the oversight of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nSir Adrian Montague retired from the Committee on 27 May 2020 and Amanda Blanc retired from the Committee on 6 July 2020 following her appointment as Group CEO. I would like to thank them both for their contribution. The  members  of  the  Committee  as  at 31 December 2020 are shown in the table below. I was appointed as Chair  of  the  Committee  on  27  May  2020.  Mohit  Joshi  and  Jim McConville  joined  the  Committee  on  1  December  2020  and  Pippa Lambert  joined  the  Committee  on  1  January  2021.  Details  of members' experience and qualifications are shown in the 'Our Board of Directors' section, and their attendance at Committee meetings during  the  year  is  shown  within  the  Directors'  and  Corporate Governance report.\n\n| Name                  | Member since   | Years on the  Committee   |\n|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| George Culmer (Chair) | 25/09/2019     | 1                         |\n| Patricia Cross        | 01/12/2013     | 7                         |\n| Patrick Flynn         | 16/07/2019     | 1                         |\n| Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda   | 26/06/2015     | 5                         |\n| Mohit Joshi           | 01/12/2020     | <1                        |\n| Jim McConville        | 01/12/2020     | <1                        |\n| Michael Mire          | 12/09/2013     | 7                         |\n\n## Committee Purpose\n\nThe main purpose of the Committee is the oversight of the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board to enable it  to  identify  and  respond  appropriately  to  current  and  future opportunities and  challenges. To assist in identifying and nominating candidates for the Board, the Committee monitors the succession plans for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Committee also oversees talent development for the wider Group and diversity and inclusion initiatives. During the year, the Board and Committee's  remit  and  responsibilities  were  reviewed.  With  effect from  1  January  2020  the  Committee  changed  its  name  to  the Nomination  and  Governance  Committee  and  expanded  its responsibilities to include oversight of governance and organisational change.\n\nMore information on the Board and Committee's structure can be found in the Directors' and Corporate Governance report.\n\n## Board and executive succession planning\n\nThe  2018  UK  Corporate  Governance  Code  (the  Code)  places  an emphasis on succession planning and the Committee has built on its existing processes to strengthen its focus in this area.\n\nThe  Committee,  on  behalf  of  the  Board,  regularly  assesses  the balance  of  Executive  and  Non-Executive  Directors,  and  the composition of the Board in terms of skills, experience, diversity and capacity.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nFollowing five years as Non-Executive Chairman and seven years in total  on  the  Board,  Sir  Adrian  Montague  retired  as  Non-Executive Chairman  and  as  Chair  of  the  Nomination  and  Governance Committee on 27 May 2020, and from the Board on 31 May 2020. The Committee initiated a process to identify a successor as Chair after Sir Adrian had indicated in January 2020 that he intended to retire. I expressed an interest in becoming Chair, and accordingly recused myself from the selection and recruitment process. The Committee agreed that Amanda Blanc, at that time another Independent NonExecutive Director, lead the recruitment. The Committee approved the search criteria for the role and engaged MWM to identify suitable potential  candidates.  The  role  criteria  focused  on  individuals  who had  undertaken  a  successful  executive  career;  had  significant insurance or financial services experience; FTSE 100 Board Chair or Senior Independent Director experience; experience of transformation and demonstrable leadership ability. The Committee considered a longlist of candidates and assessed these against the candidate  profile.  A  shortlist  of  two  candidates  was  produced following this process. The Committee interviewed both candidates, and  recommended  my  appointment  as  Chair,  with  effect  from 27  May  2020.  The  appointment  was  approved  by  the  Financial Conduct  Authority  (FCA)  and  the  Prudential  Regulatory  Authority (PRA).\n\nPatrick Flynn was appointed as SID on 7 September 2020. Patrick has been a member of the Board and the Committee since July 2019 and brings significant experience of both retail financial and insurance services. I had previously served as SID from 1 January 2020 until my appointment as Chair.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed the Board skills matrix and capability  gaps  identified  and  agreed  on  the  areas  of  experience which would be beneficial to the composition of the Board. With the appointment of Amanda Blanc as Group CEO, and my appointment as Chair, the Board required replenishment. MWM was engaged to undertake  an  extensive  external  search  based  on  the  role specifications agreed by the Committee. The Committee considered the  role  profiles  of  the  shortlisted  candidates,  met  the  candidates with the most alignment to the specification and recommended the appointment of Mohit Joshi, Jim McConville and Pippa Lambert to the  Board.  Jim  and  Mohit  were  appointed  to  the  Board  on 1 December  2020  and  Jim  has  assumed  the  role  of  Chair  of  the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee. Jim and Mohit bring significant experience in retail financial services and operational and IT transformation to the Board. Pippa was appointed to the Board on 1  January  2021  and  has  significant  experience  in  global  financial services, people strategies and transformation programmes.",

        "page_content": "Nomination and Governance Committee report continued\n\n## Executive Directors\n\nThe Committee conducted the process for the recruitment of a new Group CEO, leading to the appointment of Amanda Blanc on 6 July 2020. The Committee approved the search brief and engaged MWM to identify suitable candidates. The brief included finding candidates with  deep  insurance  experience,  a  track  record  of  running  large global  organisations,  outstanding  leadership  qualities,  a  customer focused  approach  and  alignment  to  the  Company's  culture  and values. Amanda Blanc expressed an interest in being considered for the role and recused herself from the Committee discussions on the CEO  appointment  process.  A  diverse  longlist  of  candidates  was reviewed  by  the  Committee  and  the  Chair  met  the  internal  and external  candidates  on  the  resulting  shortlist.  The  successful candidate  met  with  the  FCA  and  the  PRA.  The  Remuneration Committee led on the development of an appropriate remuneration package for the role and approved the final package to be offered to the successful candidate. Both the Remuneration and Nomination and  Governance  Committees  were  mindful  of  shareholder  views when  considering  the  remuneration  package  for  the  role.  Having considered  her  skills,  experience  and  personal  attributes  the Committee unanimously agreed to recommend Amanda Blanc as Group  CEO.  Amanda  was  formerly  an  Independent  Non-Executive Director  of  the  Company and was first appointed to the Board on 2 January 2020.\n\nMWM undertook the search and selection processes for the Board Chair,  Non-Executive  Directors  and  Group  CEO  but  had  no  other connections with the Company or any individual directors.\n\n## Talent management\n\nThe Committee monitors the development of the Group Executive Committee (ExCo) to ensure that there is a diverse supply of senior executives and potential future Executive Board members with the appropriate  skills  and  experience.  The  appointment  of  the  new Group CEO in July 2020 brought renewed focus to ensuring that the Company  has  the  best  leaders  and  an  optimal  organisational structure.  During  2020,  the  Committee  received  updates  from  the Chief People Officer on the development plans and talent profiles of the ExCo in line with the Group's succession plans. The Chief People Officer  also  provided  strategic  workforce  planning  updates  in response to the challenges presented by COVID-19.\n\nThe  Committee  considers  the  development  plans  designed  to prepare successors for ExCo roles and internal talent development and developing a pipeline of potential future leaders has continued to receive Committee focus during the year, despite the unexpected challenges  of  COVID-19,  with  programmes  being  adapted  and redesigned for virtual delivery.\n\nThe Committee also considers the initiatives to enhance, strengthen and  diversify  the  talent  pipeline  across  the  wider  Group  and members of  the  Committee  remain  involved  in  various  initiatives, including the ongoing Accelerating Leadership from the Inside Out (ALIO)  and  ALIO  Ethnic  Minorities  programmes  to  support  the development of future female and ethnic minority leaders.\n\n## Diversity\n\nDiversity  and  inclusion  continue  to  be  an  area  of  focus  for  the Committee  and  the  Board.  The  Board  is  committed  to  having  a diverse  and  inclusive  leadership  team  which  provides  a  range  of perspectives and insights and the challenge needed to support good decision  making.  Diversity  at  Aviva  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, gender  and  ethnicity,  and  is  inclusive  of  all  strands  of  diversity including skills and experience, geographic and social background, disability and sexual orientation. The Board is pleased to have met the Parker Review Committee's target for all FTSE 100 boards to have at least one director from an ethnic minority background by 2021. The  Company  also  ranks  as  number  45  on  the  Stonewall  UK Workplace Equality Index.\n\nAs a global business Aviva recognises the importance of reflecting the diversity of the customers we serve in the composition of our Board and the senior management of the markets we operate in.\n\nAs  at  the  date  of  the  report  the  representation  of  women  on  the Board has increased from 33% in March 2020 to 40%. We actively support  women  advancing  into  senior  roles,  with  the  Group  CEO being a member of the 30% Club. We are a charter signatory of HM Treasury's  Women  in  Finance  Charter,  which  commits  financial services  companies  to  a  range  of  measures  to  improve  gender diversity amongst senior management. As at the date of this report females  represent  35%  of  the  ExCo  and  further  details  on  gender diversity  in  the  workforce  and  wider  senior  leadership  population can be found in the Strategic report.\n\nIn  August  2020,  the  Board  adopted  a  Diversity  and  Inclusion statement  which  supports  the  Committee  in  its  approach  to succession planning. The Board's Diversity and Inclusion statement, which  is  in  line  with  the  overall  Group  Diversity  and  Inclusion strategy, is available on the Company's website at www.aviva.com/corporate-governance.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and independence\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Committee  reviewed  the  balance  of  skills, experience  and  independence  of  the  Board.  The  Committee conducted a review of individual director conflict authorisations as recorded  in  the  Conflicts  of  Interest  register.  The  register  is maintained by the Group Company Secretary and sets out any actual or  potential  conflict  of  interest  situations  which  a  director  has disclosed to the Board in line with their statutory duties. In order to form  a  view  of  a  director's  independence  consideration  was  also given to other external appointments held by each director.\n\nFor Non-Executive  Directors, independence  in  thought  and judgement is vital to facilitating constructive and challenging debate in the boardroom and is essential to the operational effectiveness of the Board and Committees of Aviva. The Committee determines a Non-Executive Director's independence in line with Provision 10 of the Code and satisfied itself that the Non-Executives met the criteria for independence and that the Chair of the Board met the criteria on appointment to that role.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Committee monitors the Group's compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate  Governance  Code  and  other  areas  of  regulation  and guidance.  The  Group  Company Secretary provides updates to the Committee on governance matters, legal and litigation risks which have the potential to impact the reputation of the Group.\n\nThe  Committee  considers  succession  planning  for  material subsidiaries  around  the  Group  and,  where  appropriate,  approves changes to the composition of the material subsidiary boards. The Committee  also  reviews  the  outcomes  of  the  board  evaluations completed by subsidiaries across the Group and monitors the action plans developed by subsidiary boards to reflect those outcomes.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Committee  focused  on  the  implementation  and embedding of the Group Governance Framework for the oversight of the Group's subsidiaries and updates continued to be received and approved by the Committee relating to the Subsidiary Governance Principles, the effectiveness of the Company's subsidiary boards and the Group Conflicts of Interest policy.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe  Committee  undertakes  a  review  of  its  effectiveness  annually. More  information  can  be  found  in  the  Directors'  and  Corporate Governance report.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Committee report\n\n## Committee focus during 2020\n\nI am pleased to present the Risk Committee (the Committee) report for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Company's approach to risk and risk management together with detail on the principal risks that face the Group are explained within the Risk and risk management section of this report.\n\nDuring the year the Committee held additional meetings to focus on the COVID-19 global pandemic and received regular updates on the developing  risks  including  the  broader  view  of  risk  coverage  by business  units  response,  the  prioritisation  decisions  around  risk management, the Company's scenario planning and the impact on the  Group's  capital  and  liquidity.  The  Committee  also  spent significant time on the ongoing volatility of interest rate risk exposure and financial stability risk arising from the clearing and settlement considerations connected to the UK's exit from the European Union (EU).\n\nThe Committee held joint sessions with the Customer, Conduct and Reputation  Committee  (CCRC)  in  order  to  further  support  the oversight  of  conduct  risk  management.  In  November  2020,  the Committee further assessed its role again, and concluded that the oversight  of  conduct  risk  topics  would  be  enhanced  if  the  CCRC became a sub-committee of the Risk Committee. This further aligned the oversight of conduct risks with other operational risks.\n\nThe Committee continued to review and oversee the strengthening of  the  Group's  operational  risk  profile  and  control  environment, supported by the development of the operational risk dashboard.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nGeorge  Culmer  and  Amanda  Blanc  stepped  down  from  the Committee on 27 May 2020 and 6 July 2020 when they became Chair and Chief Executive respectively. The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2020 are shown in the table below. Jim McConville and  Mohit  Joshi  joined  the  Committee  on  1  December  2020  and bring significant experience  in  retail financial services and operational and IT transformation. Details of members' experience, qualifications  and  attendance  at  Committee  meetings  during  the year  are  shown  within  the  Directors'  and  Corporate  Governance report.\n\n| Name                        | Member since   | Years on the  Committee   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda (Chair) | 26/06/2015     | 5                         |\n| Patrick Flynn               | 16/07/2019     | 1                         |\n| Mohit Joshi                 | 01/12/2020     | <1                        |\n| Jim McConville              | 01/12/2020     | <1                        |\n| Michael Mire                | 12/09/2013     | 7                         |\n\n## Committee purpose\n\nThe  main  purpose  of  the  Committee  is  to  assist  the  Board  in  its oversight  of  risk  within  the  Group,  with  a  focus  on  reviewing  the Group's risk appetite and risk profile in relation to capital, liquidity and franchise value and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's RMF. The Committee reviews the methodology used in determining the Group's capital requirements and associated stress testing and ensures that due diligence appraisals are carried out on strategic or significant transactions.\n\nIn addition to the risks inherent in the Group's investment portfolio, the  Committee  reviews  the  Group's  operational  risks,  including significant changes to the regulatory framework.\n\nThe Committee works with the Remuneration Committee to ensure that  risk  management  and  risk  culture  is  properly  considered  in setting the Remuneration Policy.\n\nDuring 2020, a review of the Terms of Reference was carried out to provide greater clarity to the role and responsibilities between the Committee and CCRC to support appropriate oversight of conduct risk issues. As a result, the Committee held joint meetings with the CCRC to further assist co-ordination between the two Committees when assessing Conduct Risk matters, particularly when monitoring the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  customers  and  markets.  This  coordinated approach to oversight was formalised through the CCRC becoming a sub-committee of the Risk Committee to bring together committee oversight of all operational risk matters into one area. The Committee  Terms  of  Reference  were  also  clarified  in  respect  of oversight  of  operational  controls,  with  the  Audit  Committee overseeing controls over financial reporting, and the Risk Committee overseeing all other operational risk controls. The Committee also works  closely  with  the  Remuneration  and  Audit  Committees.  The cross  membership  between  these  Committees  promotes  a  good understanding of issues and efficient communication.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nDuring the year the Committee spent a substantial amount of time on  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  the  operational,  economic  and insurance exposure. The Committee met on a more regular basis and held additional meetings to receive updates on the solvency position of  the  Group;  the  balance  sheet  and  capital  related  management actions  that  were  being  taken;  the  operational  readiness  of  the Group;  the  insurance  risk  exposure;  and  engagement  with  the regulators.\n\nDuring  2020  there  was  significant  market  volatility  and  changing government stimulus and the overall recovery analysis continued to adapt to these changes.\n\nThe  operational  resilience  pilot  exercise  supported  the  Group's approach to COVID-19 resilience activities, for example exceptions on provision of devices and alternate mobile working. This ensured that  a  strong  internal  communications  cascade  was  in  operation with  full  colleague  support  being  provided.  As  part  of  operational readiness, the Group made the decision that new business was deprioritised  in  order  for  staff  to  deal  with  existing  and  vulnerable customers and in particular claims. The Committee focused on the safety  of  employees,  particularly  those  with  underlying  health conditions  and  ensured  that  management  had  plans  in  place  to protect  employees,  and  accommodate  working  from  home,  while ensuring that all critical services were maintained.\n\nThe Committee considered the overall impact of COVID-19 on the Group strategy and the consequences and trade offs made over the period, structural change and customer behaviour. The Committee's working scenario for COVID-19 was considered more prudent than the scenario devised by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. The Committee welcomed that customer actions taken by the Group in response to COVID-19 had been positive and were generally ahead of the regulatory agenda.",

The  Committee  recognised  that  progress  had  been made, including an improvement in cyber resilience maturity.\n\nThe Committee also received deep dive sessions into the Company's cloud model  and  associated  opportunities  including  cloud governance,  controls  and  assurance,  the  developing  regulatory position and the Group's Cyber position in order to provide a holistic view of the risks and opportunities to the Group.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Committee  encouraged  the  development  of  the enterprise  risk  dashboard,  specifically  to  include  categorisation  of risks across our different markets, risk appetites and focus on regular updates  on  key  developments.  This  aligned  to  the  financial  risk appetite  chart  requested  by  the  Committee,  with  the  inclusion  of updates on the operational risk and control environment and route to Green plans. During the most critical first wave of the COVID-19 period  the  dashboard  was  refreshed  every  two  weeks  to  consider current and emerging risks on a regular basis.\n\nThe  Committee  requested  horizontal  deep  dives,  which  included change  management  and  the  governance  of  the  global  change portfolio and material change programmes for 2020. The Committee welcomed  the  enhanced  reporting  and  requested  that  further change updates were provided throughout the year with enhanced risk  reporting  against  each  completed  and  in-flight  programme,  a clearer risk landscape in respect of change and a risk assessment of first line programme success measures and objectives.\n\nThe Committee also received a deep dive session on France and its capital position and sensitivity to interest rate risk volatility. As part of  this  the  Committee  discussed  the  risk  appetite  based  on  the current  strategy,  the  actions  and  plans  taken  during  2020  and currently  underway,  contractual  commitments  both  to  customers and our commercial partner and other strategic options. As part of the review of France the Committee focused on the misapplication of regulatory rules which had taken place and requested an overview of the additional validation work that was conducted in response.\n\nThe Committee  requested  updates  on  the  Canadian  risk environment, insurance risk and learnings on GI policy wordings and control  processes.  The  Committee  challenged  the  processes  to ensure they were leading to the right customer outcomes.\n\n## Global Climate Change\n\nDuring the year the Committee received an emerging risk deep dive on global climate change, including the current context, interconnected  risks,  alternative  scenarios  and  the  work  being undertaken in Aviva to address the issue of climate change as part of Aviva's  new  climate  strategy.

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit Committee (the Committee) report for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Committee is to provide oversight of the process  to  ensure  our  half  and  full  year  financial  statements  and quarterly  operating  updates  are  suitable  for  publication.  The Committee provides the Board with assurance as to the integrity of the  Group's  financial  reporting  and,  together  with  the  Risk Committee,  monitors  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control environment. The Committee  monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of our system of control over financial reporting and the effectiveness,  performance,  objectivity  and  independence  of  our internal  and  external  auditors.  The  Committee  also  monitors  our whistleblowing arrangements. The Audit Committee responsibilities are set out in full in its Terms of Reference.\n\n## Committee focus during 2020\n\nDuring  the  year  the  Committee  closely  monitored  the  impact  of COVID-19 on the Finance and Internal Audit functions, the financial control environment and on the Group financial results.\n\nThe Committee also discussed the merits of more regular reporting to  update  the  market  on  Group  performance,  and  following  the agreements  of  the  Board,  supported  the  process  to  move  to quarterly operating updates. The Committee dedicated a substantial amount of time to reviewing the Group's half and full year financial statements,  supported  by  detailed  reviews  of  the  judgements applied in preparation of the financial statements, including Life and General Insurance technical provisions given the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the review of technical provision models, particularly  in  France  following  the  misapplication  of  regulatory rules.\n\nThe Committee also focused on the Group's financial reporting, our system  of  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  and  Financial Reporting  Control  Framework  (FRCF),  and  the  performance  of  the internal and external auditors.\n\nThe Committee had commenced a competitive tender process for the external auditor, however as a result of COVID-19 the Committee, following approval by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), agreed to  defer  the  external  audit  tender,  by  two  years,  until  2022,  as  the requirement to have an open, transparent process could not be met.\n\nThe Committee assessed the potential impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), particularly the new insurance accounting standard (IFRS 17) on the Group's financial operations.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nGeorge Culmer retired from the Committee when he became Chair with effect from 27 May 2020. Jim McConville was appointed to the Committee on 1 December 2020 and brings significant experience of financial services. The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2020 are  shown in  the  following  table.  Details  of  their  experience, qualifications and attendance at Committee meetings, together with the number of Committee meetings held during the year are shown in  the  'Our  Board  of  Directors'  section  and  the  Directors'  and Corporate Governance report.\n\n| Name                  | Member since   | Years on the  Committee   |\n|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Patrick Flynn (Chair) | 16/07/2019     | 1                         |\n| Patricia Cross        | 01/12/2013     | 7                         |\n| Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda   | 05/07/2019     | 1                         |\n| Jim McConville        | 01/12/2020     | <1                        |\n\n## Committee member requirements\n\nThe  Committee  annually  reviews  how  its  members  meet  the experience and expertise criteria set out in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and the FCA Disclosure Guidance and Transparency  Rules  (DTRs).  I  as  Committee  Chair,  Bel\u00e9n  Romana Garc\u00eda  and  Jim  McConville,  fulfilled  both  the  Code  and  the  DTR requirements for financial expertise and experience. The Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the insurance and broader financial services industry.\n\n## Committee purpose\n\nIn January 2020 the Committee's Terms of Reference were reviewed and updated to further clarify the delineation of oversight of internal controls  with  the  Risk  Committee  and  the  Committee  operated under  the  revised  terms  of  reference  throughout  2020.  The Committee  is  responsible  for  overseeing  internal  controls  over financial reporting while the Risk Committee is responsible for the oversight  of  other  areas  of  internal  control.  The  Committee  acts independently  of  management  and  works  closely  with  the Remuneration  and  the  Risk  Committees.  The  cross-membership between these Committees supports a good understanding of areas of concern and facilitates efficient communication.\n\n## Effectiveness reviews\n\nThe  Committee  undertakes  a  review  of  its  effectiveness  annually. More  information  can  be  found  in  the  Directors'  and  Corporate Governance report.\n\nEvaluations of the External Auditor and Internal Audit function are also conducted on behalf of the Committee each year.\n\nThe  2020  External  Audit  Effectiveness  review  was  undertaken through completion of a questionnaire by the Committee, subsidiary company audit committees, senior management, and members of the Group's finance teams. The review focused on the effectiveness of the audit team, expertise and resources and interaction with audit committees. Overall feedback was positive and where opportunities for improvement were identified, PwC was asked to take account of that feedback in the planning for future audit activity. The Committee concluded that the Auditor continued to perform effectively and is recommended to shareholders for reappointment at the 2021 AGM. The  Company  has  complied  with  the  Statutory  Audit  Services  for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Committee also conducts an annual review of the Internal Audit function  to  assess  its  effectiveness  and  to  satisfy  itself  that  the quality,  experience  and  expertise  of  the  Internal  Audit  function  is appropriate for the business. This is carried out by reviewing reports issued  by  Internal  Audit  and  the  output  of  an  annual  stakeholder effectiveness survey. This formal process is supplemented by regular private discussions with executive management, the Internal Auditor and the Auditor. The Committee concluded that for 2020 the function performed well and remained effective.",

The Committee receives reports on the number of cases reported to the Speak Up service, the proportion of reports that are designated as instances of whistleblowing, the number of substantiated cases and  summaries  of  the  action  taken.  The  Committee  continues  to look for opportunities to further enhance the Speak Up service.\n\n## 2021 priorities\n\nIn  2021,  in  addition  to  carrying  out  its  principal  function,  the Committee will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on key internal functions and any impact on reported financial results. The Committee  will  also  monitor  changes  in  the  external  audit environment following the Brydon, Kingman and Competition and Market  Authority  reviews  of  audit  in  the  UK.  The  Committee  will continue  to  support  the  development  of  the  ORCM  framework  in relation to internal controls over financial reporting and monitor the implementation of the new IFRS 17 standard, ahead of its scheduled introduction from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Patrick Flynn\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\n3 March 2021\n\n## Activities performed during 2020\n\n- \u221e Recommended to the Board for approval the Quarter 1 update, 2020 half year, Quarter 3 update and full year financial statements\n\n## Financial statements and accounting policies\n\n- \u221e Approved the IFRS and SII technical provisions with the 2020 half and full year financial statements\n- \u221e Recommended  to  the  Board  for  approval  the  SII  Solvency  and Financial Condition Report\n- \u221e Reviewed and challenged the technical provisions relating to the Group  Life  and  General  Insurance  operations  particularly  in  the context of the COVID-19 pandemic\n- \u221e Reviewed and challenged the correction of mis-applied rules in the French actuarial model and the resulting impact on solvency\n- \u221e Reviewed  the  findings  from  France  actuarial  model  review undertaken  by  Ernst  &  Young  and  group-wide  actuarial  model assurance performed by PwC\n- \u221e Reviewed  and  challenged  the  treatment  and  recoverability  of goodwill and other intangible assets particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic\n- \u221e Reviewed  the  Group  Chief  Financial  Officer's  reports  which included:  IFRS  and  SII  key  assumptions  and  judgements; accounting developments including the new IFRS; and overview of internal control and risk management over financial reporting\n- \u221e Reviewed and challenged the going concern assumptions for 2020 and  the  principles  underpinning  the  Longer-Term  Viability Statement\n- \u221e Reviewed  the  Group  Chief  Actuary's  report  on  significant  issues related to the technical provisions of SII and IFRS\n- \u221e Assessed that the Annual report was considered fair, balanced and understandable particularly in the context of the transparency of disclosures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance to shareholders of understanding the Group's position\n\n## External audit, auditor engagement and policy\n\n- \u221e Reviewed the effectiveness of the Auditor and was satisfied that the services  it  provided  remained  effective,  objective  and  fit  for purpose\n- \u221e Reviewed the Auditor's compliance with the independence criteria set out in the Code\n- \u221e Monitored  compliance  with  our  External  Auditor  Business Standard on a quarterly basis\n- \u221e Refreshed the External Auditor Business Standard\n- \u221e Held  private  meetings  with  the  Auditor  without  management present to provide an appropriate forum for issues to be raised\n- \u221e Reviewed reports from the Auditor regarding: the 2020 Audit Plan and progress against plan and reports on the review and audit of the  2020  half  and  full  year  results,  respectively,  including  key assumptions  used  and  outcomes  of  the  work  performed  and 'Agreed upon Procedures' in respect of the Quarter 1 and Quarter 3 operating performance updates.\n- \u221e Agreed to defer the external audit tender by two years.\n\n## Internal audit\n\n- \u221e Reviewed reports from the Chief Audit Officer (CAO)\n- \u221e Reviewed and approved changes to the Internal Audit Charter and Business Standard\n- \u221e Reviewed and approved the Internal Audit Plan\n- \u221e Assessed the independence of the CAO\n- \u221e Assessed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function\n- \u221e Held private meetings with the CAO without management present\n- \u221e Reviewed the objectives of the CAO\n\n## Internal controls, including financial reporting control framework and financial reporting developments\n\n- \u221e Received quarterly updates on the effectiveness of the FRCF and rectification of controls\n- \u221e Reviewed  management's  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the risk management and control environment\n- \u221e Reviewed the Internal Audit function report to ensure adequacy of the systems of internal control and risk management",

The Committee reviews the underlying assumptions as these involve  complex judgements and changes can have a significant impact on reported results. |\n| Committee's response                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\nTechnical Provisions. The  Committee  reviewed  and  challenged  the  assumptions  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  Best  Estimate  Liability component of the technical provisions required under SII, and the expense impacts on SII reserves across our life and general insurance businesses.\n\nThe Committee reviewed and challenged the longevity, expense and credit default assumptions used for the quarterly operating updates, and 2020 half year and full year financial statements. The process around the setting of longevity assumptions was a particularly significant area for review as those judgements could continue to have a material impact on Aviva's SII and IFRS results. During 2020, the Committee worked closely with the Audit Committee of the Group's UK Life subsidiary, Aviva Life Holdings UK Ltd, to review the detailed analysis and to validate changes observed in recent mortality experience and the resulting impact on the existing longevity assumptions. In particular, the Committee reviewed the rate of annuitant mortality change reflecting recent experience in the UK market. Following assessment of the proposed  assumption  changes  the  Committee  considered  and  noted  proposed  changes  and  their  expected  impact  on  the  financial statements.\n\nTechnical Provision Models. The Committee reviewed management's assessment of the Group's Technical Provision models, including details of additional controls that were being implemented to increase the level of confidence in the output of these models. This included a review of the key French life business unit actuarial models and the impact of low or negative interest on the model following an extended period of historical low interest rates. This review included the correction of mis-applied regulatory rules which resulted in a reduction in solvency, together with benefits from better modelling in a negative interest rate environment, and the resulting impacts on solvency.\n\nCOVID-19 assumptions. The Committee also reviewed the assumptions proposed for the setting of Technical Provisions in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included the impact of the pandemic on future mortality, credit spreads and property growth as well as the impact on general insurance claims.\n\nReview of controls associated with the SII and IFRS Life reserving process. The Committee reviewed the sign-off procedures and control framework for movements in IFRS reporting and SII results.\n\n| Matter considered                                        | Context                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IFRS and SII key  accounting judgements  and disclosures | The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board Quarterly.

The Committee challenged and recommended approval of IFRS judgements including  those  in  respect  of  goodwill  and  intangible  asset  impairment  reviews,  assets  classified  as  held  for  sale  and  the  valuation assumptions for certain mark to model assets and liabilities.\n\nImpact of exit from the European Union. The Committee reviewed the size and continuation of the allowance in our assumptions for future property prices and rental income in relation to our commercial and equity release mortgages, for the possible adverse impact including but not limited to the ultimate arrangements regarding the UK's exit from the European Union (EU). The Committee reviewed the allowance introduced following the EU referendum in 2016, and subsequent release of the allowance in the context of broader long-term assumption setting.\n\nAlternative Performance Measures (APMs). The Committee reviewed and approved the clarification and treatment of certain items within the Group's Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to further improve the transparency and consistency of reporting of APMs.\n\nProduct Governance provisions. The Committee also assessed two provisions in respect of product governance issues for heritage book customers in the UK Life business. The first was in respect of advice to customers transferring from defined benefit pension to personal pension arrangements. The second related to past communications to a specific sub-set of policyholders that may not have adequately informed them of switch-in options into with-profits funds that were available to them.\n\nImpact of COVID-19. The Committee reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the Group financial results, and in particular disclosures around the impact of the pandemic on Business Interruption insurance and motor collision frequency in the General Insurance business, and the impact on General Insurance reserves including the operation of reinsurance arrangements. The Committee also reviewed the impact on investment assets valuations. The Committee reviewed the maintenance of allowances for potential future downgrades to corporate bonds introduced in 2020 and the subsequent release of these allowances at 31 December 2020.\n\nFair, Balanced and Understandable. The Committee reviewed the Quarterly, Half Year and Full Year results to support the Board conclusion that taken as a whole, these reports were fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy. This assessment was particularly significant in the context of the transparency of disclosures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance to shareholders of understanding the Group's position during this time.",

The Committee reviewed a number of reports to allow the evaluation of the effectiveness of controls and any failings or weaknesses. The Committee continued to challenge and drive the ongoing implementation and how this supports a risk aware culture and strong internal control framework.\n\nReview of internal controls. The Committee reviewed reports on the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting to gain assurance that these remained in tolerance with no control weaknesses which could have a material impact on the financial results. The Committee met with individual business unit leaders to reinforce the importance of further improving performance of the internal control environment within the business units and provide challenge where progress was considered to be insufficient.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on the control environment and finance function. The Committee reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the internal control  environment  and  finance  operations.  This  included  reporting  on  ORCM  to  ensure  operational  risks  within  the  Finance  function remained within tolerance, and where necessary, agree the reduction or deferral of work in other areas of activity to ensure core financial operations continued.\n\nLegal and regulatory reports. The Committee received quarterly reports on current and emerging legal and regulatory matters and any potential impact on Aviva's financial statements.\n\n| Matter considered    | Context                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Internal Audit       | The Committee has responsibility for overseeing the work, effectiveness and independence of the Internal Audit  Function. |\n| Committee's response |                                                                                                                           |\n\nAnnual Plan and Budget. The Committee reviewed and approved the 2020 Internal Audit plan and budget and monitored progress against this plan. In May 2020 the Internal Audit Plan was revised to take account of the impact of COVID-19 on the work of the Internal Audit Function and on the operations and business subject to review. Progress against the Internal Audit plan was closely monitored to ensure completion of the plan by year end.\n\nQuarterly Reports. The Committee also received quarterly control reports from the Internal Audit function and challenged management on the actions being taken to improve the effectiveness of the governance and risk and control framework of the organisation. The quarterly Internal Audit reports contain control environment metrics including: the status of Internal Audit opinions that are rated as unsatisfactory or where major improvement is needed; key issues identified, emerging trends and their impacts on the organisation's risk profile; and the status of management actions to resolve issues identified. During 2020 the Committee has met with market CEOs where the status of the control environment and metrics was considered to require focus.\n\n| Matter considered   | Context                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| External Audit      | The  Committee  has  responsibility  for  monitoring  the  External  Auditor  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP's  (PwC)  independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the external audit process. |\n\n## Committee's response\n\nExternal Audit Plan and Budget. The Committee reviewed and approved the 2020 audit plan presented by PwC and progress against the plan.\n\nAudit related and non-audit services. The Committee monitors the External Auditor Business Standard to ensure no firm, other than PwC undertakes  audit  and  audit-related  services  other  than  in  exceptional  circumstances.  The  Committee  also  monitors  non-audit  services (including audit-related and other assurance services) provided by PwC.\n\nIn 2020 the Group paid PwC \u00a321.2 million (2019: \u00a321.2 million) for  audit and audit-related assurance services. PwC were paid \u00a33.4 million (2019: \u00a30.8 million) for  other services, giving a total fee to PwC of \u00a324.6 million (2019: \u00a322.0 million). This included a fee of \u00a32.4 million to undertake a 'reasonable assurance' review of the Solvency II Partial Internal Model following the correction of the misapplication of regulatory rules in our French actuarial models. In addition to these fees, audit fees payable to PwC in respect of investment funds consolidated in the Group financial statements were \u00a32.7 million ( 2019: \u00a32.4 million ). These fees are borne directly by the unitholders of the funds and are not borne by the Group. Further details are provided in note 13 of the financial statements.\n\nRequest for Additional Actuarial Models Assurance. The Committee requested that PwC undertake additional assurance activity in relation to the French life asset and liability management actuarial model following the correction of the misapplication of regulatory rules which resulted in a reduction in solvency. The Committee reviewed and agreed the scope of additional assurance work. The scope of this assurance work included performing an independent baselining review to check the validity of certain models and validate the operating effectiveness of the associated controls.\n\nTender of External Audit. Under Competition and Markets Authority regulations, Aviva is required to tender for the provision of the external audit every 10 years. PwC was appointed for the first time for the 31 December 2012 financial year end and therefore a mandatory re-tender was required for the year ending 31 December 2022. The Committee initiated the external audit tender process during 2020, which had anticipated a series of meetings and direct engagement with potential external audit candidates, however COVID-19 restrictions had inhibited this tender process. The Committee agreed to request a two-year extension to PwC's appointment to 2022. The FRC approved the request for the two-year extension.\n\nAudit Partner. The Committee reviewed the process to select Alex Bertolotti to replace Andrew Kail as lead PwC audit partner, including interviewing potential candidates and validated that he was an appropriate replacement.",

The Committee supports the Board in  making that assessment. |\n\nAssessment\n\n## Committee's response\n\nThe Committee reviewed the principles underpinning the Statement for 2020 and concluded that the Company and its subsidiaries will be able to continue in operation and meet their liabilities as they become due. The Committee recommended to the Board the Statement and going concern statement to the Board. More information on these statements can be found in the Other Statutory Information section of the Directors' and Corporate Governance report. The Committee continues to consider it appropriate that the Statement covers a three-year period. The Committee also considered the additional guidance issued by the FRC in June 2020 on going concern considering the COVID-19 pandemic  including  the  Group's  specific  circumstances,  current  and  potential  cash  resource  and  access  to  existing  and  new  financial facilities. At half year 2020 the Committee reviewed the outcome of a series of stress testing exercises undertaken though 2020 taking account of the impact of COVID-19 on markets, Group solvency, business unit remittances and central liquidity.\n\n| Matter considered           | Context                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Implementation   of IFRS 17 | IFRS 17 is a new insurance accounting standard issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  due to take effect on 1 January 2023.

It is expected that IFRS 17 will have a significant impact on the measurement and disclosure of insurance contracts. The Committee continues to  regularly  assess  the  impact  on  the  financial  reporting  process,  the  operation  of  new  internal  financial  tools  to  be  used  for  financial forecasting and planning purposes, and the calculation of insurance liabilities under the new standard.

In addition, the Committee reviewed disclosures made for the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Aviva's financial performance in its publication of quarterly operating updates and half-year and full year financial statements.\n\nThe Committee monitored the impact of COVID-19 on the control environment and for the performance of control assurance activity. The Committee continued to engage with the regulator to seek clarification on the balance sheet disclosures, including treating COVID-19 as a 'major development' as per SII Directive.",

Consequently, the Committee changed its name to the Customer, Conduct  and  Reputation  Committee  (previously  the  Governance Committee) and in November 2020 the Committee became a subcommittee of the Risk Committee.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered and monitored a range of matters including the treatment of our customers during COVID-19 (including vulnerable customers) and, the progress of our corporate responsibility strategy.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nI joined the Board on 1 December 2020 and assumed the role of Chair of the Committee. George Culmer was the interim Committee Chair from 6 July 2020, following Amanda Blanc's appointment as CEO. The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2020 are shown in  the  table  below.  Details  of  their  experience,  qualifications  and attendance at Committee meetings during the year are shown within the Directors' and Corporate Governance report.

It  was  agreed  that  the Committee  should  act  as  the  custodian  of  the  Aviva  purpose  on behalf of the Board and oversee the development of metrics to give insight on how Aviva was performing against the purpose.\n\nThe review also clarified the role and responsibilities between the Committee and the Risk Committee to support appropriate oversight of conduct risk issues.\n\n## COVID-19 response\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee focused on supporting customers and the wider community through the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee  provided  oversight  of  Aviva's  response  to  customer demand  during  the  pandemic  across  the  Group.  Service  levels remained stable across all markets largely due to employees working from  home with the  stability  of  customer  service  remaining  a  key priority. The Committee received and assisted in the development of structured  management  information  (MI)  data  to  support  its oversight of the impact on our customers.\n\nThe Committee reviewed reports on the conduct risks generated by COVID-19 across Aviva markets, the response of local regulators, and the support provided to the communities in which we operate. Aviva supported customers and communities through charitable donations and additional support for essential workers and those who were vulnerable. This included payment deferrals for customers in the UK, donations to the NHS and British Red Cross, a \u20ac149 million pledge to support the economy in France, free life insurance cover for  key  workers  in  Poland  and  a  range  of  actions  to  support customers in our businesses in Italy, Ireland and Canada.\n\nThe  Committee  also  monitored  how  the  Group  co-ordinated  a response across international markets and engaged the workforce. Internally,  there  was  regular  communication  with  leaders  and colleagues to provide guidance and support, and internal surveys for employees  to  provide  feedback  to  ensure  that  employees  felt supported and well informed.\n\n## Customers\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee had oversight of the customer strategy and operations. This included the creation of an enhanced customer dashboard to provide the Committee with a greater overview of key customer  metrics,  data  and  insights.  The  customer  team  worked across the business to create a monitoring framework that balanced commercial and customer outcomes and further enhanced putting the customer at the heart of the business. As part of the roll out of the new framework, governance, reporting and escalation mechanisms would  continue  to  be  reviewed  and  further  improvements  made where necessary. A set of Customer Principles was developed and designed to enhance great customer outcomes, with a focus on the most frequent customer journeys so that related simplification and improvement activities benefitted the greatest number of customers.\n\nThe Committee recognised the importance of the identification and fair treatment of vulnerable customers, and throughout the year the first  line  continued  to  receive  training  in  identifying  and  providing additional support to vulnerable customers.\n\nThe Committee continued to emphasise the importance of further developing  a  proactive  approach  to  conduct  topics  in  order  to support  action  to  prevent  instances  of  customer  detriment occurring.\n\n## Data\n\nDuring 2020 the Committee continued to review the development and delivery of data governance particularly in respect of customer data and records management within the Group. The Group Data Operations  team  worked  with  each  business  unit  to  review  and enhance oversight and reporting arrangements.\n\n## Reputation\n\nThe Committee monitored developments in the Group's reputation and  reputational  risk  position.  Key  areas  of  focus  included  the response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  treatment  of  our customers, particularly those in vulnerable categories. The Committee also monitored the response to our announcements on strategy and in changes to the composition of the Board.",

The  Committee  reviewed  the  Group's regulatory risk profile and conduct risk data analytics capability.\n\nThe Committee oversaw the establishment of a Conduct Governance and  Reporting  shared  service  team,  which  would  strengthen  best practice  amongst  the  Group.  The  Committee  considered  and approved  the  refresh  of  the  Conduct  Risk  Policy,  which  had  been substantially updated to provide a framework which monitored both customer, regulatory and market exposures, as well as the key drivers of  conduct  risk.  The  Committee  is  overseeing  the  implementation and embedding of the framework across the Group.\n\nThrough the implementation of the Conduct Risk Policy, conduct risk reporting across the business units is also being further developed and aligned to the new conduct framework. This is being used as the reporting framework for the Committee's conduct reports ensuring appropriate oversight and escalation across the Group's conduct risk exposures.\n\nThe  Committee  received  updates  from  UK  Life  and  UK  General Insurance  Conduct  Committee  Chairs,  to  provide  an  update  on progress on conduct governance in the UK and the future direction of travel.

The UK Life and UK General Insurance Committee Chairs are now standing attendees at Committee meetings.\n\n## Corporate responsibility and Sustainability\n\nThe  Committee  continued  to  monitor  our  approach  to  corporate responsibility and sustainability.\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  and  contributed  to  the  corporate responsibility strategy for 2020-25, the 'Better Tomorrow Plan' which had  been  developed  through  feedback  from  Aviva's  stakeholders and across the business.  Climate  change  consistently  emerged  as one of the most important issues in the feedback and the greatest threat to our customers, the planet and our business. Aviva has a long history  of  action  in  this  area  through  disclosure;  policy  influence; environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  engagement  and reducing  our  operational  impact,  and  the  Better  Tomorrow  Plan builds on these achievements.\n\nThe  Committee  also  continued  to  monitor  and  support  our community investment and the activities of the Aviva Foundation, which  was  established  to  distribute  the  proceeds  of  our  share forfeiture programme to good causes.\n\nAviva is  committed to behaving as a responsible corporate citizen and the Committee sets the guidance, direction and policies for the Group's  corporate  responsibility  agenda  to  identify  the  most important sustainability issues for customers, the business and our wider stakeholders. Further information on our integrated responsibility and sustainable business approach can be found on the Company's website at: www.aviva.com/social-purpose.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe  Committee  undertakes  a  review  of  its  effectiveness  annually. More  information  can  be  found  in  the  Directors'  and  Corporate Governance report.\n\n## 2021 priorities\n\nIn  2021,  the  Committee  will  continue  to  focus  on  the  impact  of COVID-19 on our customers and the wider customer and conduct agenda.

Details of any dividend waivers are disclosed in note 35.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nIn light of our 2020 performance and resilient capital and liquidity, the  Board  has  declared  a  final  dividend  of  14  pence  per  share (2019: nil), bringing the full year dividend in respect of 2020 financial year  to  21  pence  per  share (2019:  15.5  pence  per  share). On 26  November  2020,  Aviva  announced  a  new  dividend  policy  and capital framework that align with the Group's strategic priorities. We aim  to  deliver  a  sustainable  pay-out  ratio  and  grow  dividend  per share by low to mid-single digits. This level of dividend is sustainable and  resilient  to  stress,  and  is  covered  by  the  capital  and  cash generated from the core markets of UK, Ireland and Canada.\n\nUnder UK company law, we may only pay dividends if the Company has  'distributable  profits'  available.  'Distributable  profits'  are accumulated, realised profits/(losses) not previously distributed or capitalised,  less  accumulated,  unrealised  losses  not  previously written off based on IFRS. Even if distributable profits are available, we pay dividends only if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called-up share capital and non-distributable reserves  and  the  payment  of  the  dividend  does  not  reduce  the amount of our net assets to less than that aggregate.\n\nAs a holding company, the Company is dependent upon dividends and interest from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends. Many of the Company's  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  insurance  regulations  that restrict the amount of dividends that they can pay to us.\n\nHistorically,  the  Company  has  declared  an  interim  and  a  final dividend for each year (with the final dividend being paid in the year following the year to which it relates). Subject to the restrictions set out above, the payment of interim dividends on ordinary shares is made  at  the  discretion  of  the  Board,  while  payment  of  any  final dividend requires the approval of the Company's shareholders at a general  meeting.  Dividends  on  preference  shares  are  made  at  the discretion of the Board.\n\nThe  Company  pays  cash  dividends  in  pounds  sterling  and  euros, although the articles of association permit payment of dividends on ordinary shares in any currency and in forms other than cash, such as ordinary shares.\n\nInterim  dividends  are  typically  paid  in  September,  subject  to declaration by the Board. A final dividend is typically proposed by the Company's Board after the end of the relevant year and generally paid in May. The following table shows certain information regarding the dividends that we paid on ordinary shares.\n\n|   Year | Interim  dividend   per share   (pence)   | Interim   Dividend  per share  (cents) 1   | Final  dividend  per share  (pence)   | Final   dividend   per share  (cents) 1   |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|   2015 | 6.75                                      | N/A                                        | 14.05                                 | N/A                                       |\n|   2016 | 7.42                                      | N/A                                        | 15.88                                 | 18.71                                     |\n|   2017 | 8.40                                      | 9.50                                       | 19.00                                 | 21.77                                     |\n|   2018 | 9.25                                      | 10.25                                      | 20.75                                 | 24.12                                     |\n|   2019 | 15.50 2                                   | 17.35                                      | 0.00 3                                | 0.00                                      |\n|   2020 | 7.00                                      | 7.75                                       | 14.00                                 | -                                         |\n\n- 1 Euro dividend rate per share\n- 2 Interim  dividend  in  respect  of  2019  paid  in  September  2019,  second  interim  in  respect  of  2019  paid  in September 2020\n- 3 On 8  April  2020  the  Board  withdrew  its  recommendation  to  pay  the  2019  final  dividend,  referencing  the unprecedented challenges COVID-19 presents for businesses, households and customers and the adverse and highly uncertain impact on the global economy",

        "page_content": "Other statutory information continued\n\n## Distributable reserves\n\nUnder UK company law, dividends can only be paid if a company has distributable reserves sufficient to cover the dividend. At 31 December  2020,  Aviva  plc  itself  had  sufficient  distributable reserves  to  support  the  paid  and  proposed  dividends  during  the period.  In  UK  Life,  our  largest  operating  subsidiary,  distributable reserves, which could be paid to Aviva plc via its intermediate holding company,  are  based  on  the  updated  Companies  Act  2006 (Distributions of Insurance Companies) Regulations 2016 which uses an adjusted Solvency II Own Funds measure in determining profits available  for  distribution.  While  the  UK  insurance  regulatory  laws applicable  to  UK  Life  and  our  other  UK  subsidiaries  impose  no statutory restrictions on an insurer's ability to declare a dividend, the rules  require  maintenance  of  each  insurance  company's  solvency margin,  which  might  impact  their  ability  to  pay  dividends  to  the parent  company.  Our  other  life  insurance,  general  insurance,  and fund management subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends and make loans to the parent company is similarly restricted by local corporate or insurance laws and regulations. In all jurisdictions, when paying dividends, the relevant subsidiary must take into account its capital position  and  must  set  the  level  of  dividend  to  maintain  sufficient capital to meet minimum solvency requirements and any additional target capital expected by local regulators. We do not believe that the legal and regulatory restrictions constitute a material limitation on the  ability  of  our  businesses  to  meet  their  obligations  or  to  pay dividends to the parent company, Aviva plc.\n\n## Share class and listing\n\nAll the Company's shares in issue are fully paid up and the ordinary and  preference  shares  have  a  Premium  and  Standard  listing respectively on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nDetails of the Company's share capital and shares under option at 31  December 2020 and shares issued during the year are given in notes 33 to 36. The calculation of earnings per share is included in note 15.\n\n## Share capital\n\nDuring  the  year,  7,361,275  ordinary  shares  were  allotted  to  satisfy amounts under the Group's employee share and incentive plans. At 31 December 2020 the:\n\n- \u221e issued  ordinary  share  capital  totalled  3,928,490,420  shares  of 25 pence each (83% of total share capital)\n- \u221e issued  preference  share  capital  totalled  200,000,000  shares  of \u00a31 each (17% of total share capital)\n\nFurther  details  on  the  ordinary  share  capital  of  the  Company  are shown in note 33.\n\n## Rights and obligations attaching to the Company's ordinary shares and preference shares\n\nRights and obligations attaching to the Company's shares together with  the  powers  of  the  Company's  directors  are  set  out  in  the Company's Articles of Association (the Articles), copies of which can be obtained from Companies House and the Company's website at www.aviva.com/articles,  or  by  writing  to  the  Group  Company Secretary.  The  powers  of  the  Company's  directors  are  subject  to relevant  legislation  and,  in  certain  circumstances  (including  in relation to the issue or buying back by the Company of its shares), are subject to authority being given to the directors by shareholders at a general  meeting.  At  the  2021  AGM,  shareholders  will  be  asked  to renew  the  directors'  authority  to  allot  new  securities.  Details  are contained in the Notice of 2021 Annual General Meeting (Notice of AGM).\n\n## Restrictions on transfer of securities\n\nWith  the  exception  of  restrictions  under  the  Company's  employee share incentive plans, while the shares are subject to the plan rules, there  are  no  restrictions  on  the  voting  rights  attaching  to  the Company's  ordinary  shares  or  the  transfer  of  securities  in  the Company.\n\nWhere,  under  an  employee  share  incentive  plan  operated  by  the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised at the discretion  of  the  participants.  No  person  holds  securities  in  the Company  carrying  special  rights  with  regard  to  control  of  the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.\n\n## Significant agreements - change of control\n\nThere are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and joint venture agreements. None are considered to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. All of the Company's employee share  incentive  plans  contain  provisions  relating  to  a  change  of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become  exercisable  on  a  change  of  control,  subject  to  the satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro rata reduction as may be applicable under the rules of the employee share incentive plans.\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nAt the Company's 2020 AGM, shareholders renewed the Company's authorities to make market purchases of up to 392 million ordinary shares,  up  to  100  million  8\u00be%  preference  shares  and  up  to 100 million 8\u215c% preference shares. The authority was not used and no  shares  were  purchased  during  2020.  At  the  2021  AGM, shareholders  will  be  asked  to  renew  the  authorities  to  buy  Aviva shares for another year and the resolution will once again propose a maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which the Company can purchase of less than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital. Details are contained  in the Notice of AGM  available  at www.aviva.com/agm. The Company held no treasury shares during the year or up to the date of this report.\n\n## Disclosure guidance and transparency rule 5 - major shareholders\n\nThe  table  below  shows  the  holdings  of  major  shareholders  in  the Company's  issued  ordinary  share  capital  in  accordance  with  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTRs) notified to the Company as at 31 December 2020 and 3 March 2021. Information provided to the Company under the DTRs is publicly available via the regulatory information services and on the Company's website.\n\n## Shareholding interest\n\n|                  | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 3 March 2021     | At 3 March 2021     |\n|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Shareholder      | Notified   holdings   | Nature of  holding    | Notified   holdings | Nature of   holding |\n| BlackRock, Inc 1 | Above 5%              | Indirect              | Above 5%            | Indirect            |",

Under the Articles, the Board can appoint additional directors or appoint a director to fill a casual vacancy. The new director must retire at the first AGM following their appointment and can only continue as a director if they are elected by shareholders at the AGM.\n\nAt no time during the year did any director hold a material interest in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings other than an indemnity provision between each director and the Company and employment contracts between each executive director  and  a  Group  company.  The  Company  has  purchased  and maintained  throughout  the  year  directors'  and  officers'  liability insurance in respect of itself, its directors and others.\n\nThe Company has also executed deeds of indemnity for the benefit of each director of the Company, and each person who was a director of the Company during the year, in respect of liabilities that may attach to them in their capacity as directors of the Company or of associated companies. The Articles allow such indemnities to be granted. These indemnities are qualifying third-party indemnity provisions as defined by  section  234  of  the  Companies  Act  2006.  These  indemnities  are currently in force. Details of directors' remuneration, service contracts, employment contracts and interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the Directors' Remuneration report.\n\nThe Company has also granted indemnities by way of a deed poll to the directors of the Group's subsidiary companies, including former directors who retired during the year and directors appointed during the year, which is a 'qualifying third party indemnity' for the purposes of the applicable sections 309A to 309C of the Companies Act 1985. The  deed  poll  indemnity  was  in  force  throughout  the  year  and remains in force.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nGroup companies use financial instruments to manage certain types of risks, including those relating to credit, foreign currency exchange, cash flow,  liquidity,  interest  rates,  and  equity  and  property  prices. Details of the objectives and management of these instruments are contained in the 'Risk and risk management' section and in note 59 on risk management.\n\n## Political donations\n\nAviva did not make any political donations during 2020.\n\n## Disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nIn  accordance  with  section  418  of  the  Companies  Act  2006,  the directors in office at the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts  confirm  that,  so  far  as  they  are  each  aware,  there  is  no relevant audit information of which the Company's External Auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is unaware and each director has taken all steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to make  themselves  aware  of  any  relevant  audit  information  and  to establish that PwC is aware of that information.\n\n## Annual general meeting\n\nThe 2021 AGM of the Company will be held on Thursday 6 May 2021 at St Helen's, 1 Undershaft, London EC3P 3DQ at 2pm. The Notice of AGM convening the meeting describes the business to be conducted thereat.  Any  proxy  voting  instruction,  whether  provided  online, by post or via CREST or Proximity voting, must be received by our Registrar,  Computershare  Investor  Services  PLC,  by  no  later  than 2pm on Tuesday  4  May  2021.  Further  details  can  be  found  in  the shareholder information section of the Notice of AGM.\n\n## Articles of association\n\nUnless expressly stated to the contrary in the Articles, the Company's Articles  may  only  be  amended  by  special  resolution  of  the shareholders.  The  Company's  current  Articles  were  adopted  on 10 May 2018.\n\n## Going concern and longer-term viability\n\nA detailed going concern and longer-term viability review has been undertaken  as  part  of  the  2020  reporting  process.  The  Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report, along  with  the  Group's  approach  to  risk  and  risk management.  In  addition,  the  'Financial  statements'  sections include  notes  on  the  Group's  borrowings  (note  52);  its  contingent liabilities  and  other  risk  factors  (note  55);  its  capital  management (note  57);  management  of  its  risks  including  market,  credit  and liquidity risk (note 59); and derivative financial instruments (note 60).\n\nThe  going  concern  and  longer-term  viability  review  includes consideration  of  the  Group's  current  and  forecast  solvency  and liquidity positions over a three-year period through management's 2021-2023  business  plan  and  evaluates  the  results  of  stress  and scenario testing. The Group's stress and scenario testing considers the  Group's  capacity  to  respond  to  a  series  of  relevant  financial, insurance  or  operational  shocks  should  future  circumstances  or events  differ  from  the  current  assumptions  in  the  business  plan, focussing on the impacts on Group solvency, cash remittances and liquidity. The range of scenarios allow for the potential impacts of COVID-19 both directly on the claims and operations of the Group, and also on the wider macroeconomic environment, and considers the  potential  risks  associated  with  the  UK's  negotiations  with  the European Union on their future relationship.\n\nEven  in  severe  downside  scenarios,  no  material  uncertainty  in relation  to  going  concern  and  longer-term  viability  has  been identified, due to the Group's strong solvency and liquidity positions providing considerable resilience to external shocks, underpinned by the Group's approach to risk management (see note 59).\n\nIt  is  fundamental  to  the  Group's  longer-term  strategy  that  the directors manage and monitor risk, taking into account all key risks the Group faces, including longer-term insurance risks, so that it can continue to meet its obligations to policyholders. The Group is also subject to extensive regulation and supervision under the Solvency II regulatory framework.\n\nIn  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Group  has  reduced exposure  to  equity  and  interest  rate  risk,  credit  spread  and counterparty default risk across all our major markets and actions are being taken to further reduce the sensitivity to economic shocks. In the event of major new risks emerging, the Group has a number of management actions  available  to  maintain  or  restore  key  capital, liquidity  and  solvency metrics to within the Group's approved risk appetites over the planning period.\n\n## Going concern\n\nAfter making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that  the  Company  and  the  Group  as  a  whole  have  adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt, and to consider appropriate, the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.",

Based  on  this  assessment,  the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year assessment period to 31 December 2023.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nTo support the directors' statement below that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, the Board considered the process followed to draft the Annual Report and Accounts:\n\n- \u221e Each section of the Annual Report and Accounts is prepared by a member  of  management  with  appropriate  knowledge,  seniority and  experience.  Each  preparer  receives  guidance  on  the requirement  for  content  included  in  the  Annual  Report  and Accounts to be fair, balanced and understandable\n- \u221e The overall co-ordination of the production of the Annual Report and  Accounts  is  overseen  by  the  Chief  Financial  Controller  to ensure consistency across the document\n- \u221e An extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual accuracy\n- \u221e Comprehensive  reviews  of  drafts  of  the  Annual  Report  and Accounts  are  undertaken  by  members  of  the  Aviva  Leadership team and other members of senior management and, in relation to certain parts of the report external legal advisers and the External Auditor\n- \u221e An advanced draft is considered and reviewed by the Disclosure Committee\n- \u221e The  final  draft  is  reviewed  by  the  Audit  Committee  prior  to consideration by the Board\n- \u221e Board members receive drafts of the Annual Report and Accounts for their review and input. This includes the opportunity to discuss the  drafts  with  both  management  and  the  External  Auditor, challenging the disclosures where appropriate.\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts,  the  Directors'  Remuneration  report  and  the  financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies  in  the  European  Union  (EU).  Under  company  law  the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group  and  Company  and  of  the  profit  or  loss  for  that  period.  In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u221e select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently\n- \u221e make  reasonable  and  prudent  judgements  and  accounting estimates\n- \u221e state whether applicable IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU) have been followed,  subject  to  any  material  departures  disclosed  and explained in the financial statements\n- \u221e prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it  is  inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.\n\nThe  directors  are  responsible  for  keeping  adequate  accounting records  that  are  sufficient  to  show  and  explain  the  Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  the  Group  financial  statements,  Article  4  of  the  IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe directors are responsible for making, and continuing to make, the  Company's  Annual  Report  and  Accounts  available  on  the Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation  and  dissemination  of  financial  statements  may  differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nEach  of  the  current  directors  whose  names  and  functions  are detailed in the 'Our Board of Directors' section and in the Directors' and Corporate Governance report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:  the  Group  financial  statements,  which  have  been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of  the  Group;  and  the  Strategic  report  and  the  Directors'  and Corporate  Governance  report  in  this  Annual  report  include  a  fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of  the  Group,  together  with  a  description  of  the  principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\n## Listing Rules requirements\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  Listing  Rule  (LR)  9.8.4C  R,  the  information required to be disclosed by LR 9.8.4 R can be found in the following locations:\n\n|   Section in   LR 9.8.4C R | Topic                                                   | Location in the Annual Report and  Accounts   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                         12 | Shareholder waivers of dividends                        | IFRS Financial                                |\n|                         12 | Shareholder waivers of dividends                        | Statements - note 35                          |\n|                         13 | Shareholder waivers of future dividends  IFRS Financial |                                               |\n\nBy order of the Board on 3 March 2021.\n\n## Amanda Blanc\n\nChief Executive Officer",

Our  Policy  and  our  Annual  Report  on Remuneration have also been well-received by our stakeholders over the  last  seven  years.  As  such,  we  are  not  proposing  any  major changes to the Policy, nor the overall construct of reward at Aviva. We are however, making some revisions to the metrics used under the annual  bonus  and  Long  Term  Incentive  Plan  (LTIP),  with  three objectives in mind:\n\n- \u221e Reinforce our desire to reduce complexity;\n- \u221e Ensure  colleagues  are  focused  on  areas  which  can  transform performance; and\n- \u221e Support our environmental, social and governance responsibilities.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  proposing  some  minor  amendments  to  other elements of the Policy to ensure continued alignment with corporate governance best practice in areas including pension, post-cessation shareholding requirements and malus and clawback provisions.\n\nThroughout  the  review  process,  shareholders  have  provided constructive and helpful feedback on the proposals and I would like to thank them on behalf of the Committee.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe  annual  bonus  is  intended  to  align  reward  outcomes  with  the achievement  of  key  annual  goals,  enacted  by  cascading  the scorecard down into the business. While the review suggested on the whole the bonus framework works effectively, it highlighted that the assessment process is overcomplicated, with potential for overlap in some areas.\n\nTo provide a clearer, more transparent and simpler structure, we are proposing  the  removal  of  non-financial  modifiers  and,  where appropriate,  incorporating  them  into  the  metrics  to  ensure  their impact is retained. Specifically:\n\n- \u221e Customer trust - Customers are at the heart of everything we do at  Aviva  and  we  are  retaining  Relationship  Net  Promoter  Score (RNPS) and Transactional Net Promoter Score (TNPS) as primary metrics.  The  Committee  is  satisfied  with  the  removal  of  the customer trust modifier to reduce duplication; and\n- \u221e Employee engagement - A highly engaged workforce is one that is more productive, accountable and motivated to deliver for our customers and we aim for our people to achieve their potential within a diverse, collaborative and customer-focused organisation. Therefore we are introducing employee engagement as a primary metric to reflect our focus in this area;\n- \u221e Risk and controls - The introduction of percentage Risks Inside Tolerance  (RIT)  as  a  primary  metric  for  2020,  reinforced  the fundamental importance of controlling, measuring and assessing our risk performance across the business. However, the Committee views  the  risk  modifier  as  complicated  and  duplicative.  It  is proposed to remove the modifier and instead to measure RIT and risk and controls quality, together with an additional assessment to  give  a  fuller  picture  of  how  we  are  performing  across  our  risk profile.  The  Committee  is  comfortable  with  this  since  it  retains overall discretion to adjust outcomes should they not align with underlying performance or wider business circumstances.\n\nIndividual  performance  will  continue  to  be  assessed  and  act  as  a modifier on the scorecard outcome as the Committee recognises the critical importance of individual accountability.\n\nIn terms of the financial metrics, the overall weighting will remain at 70%.  We  are  taking  the  opportunity  to  move  from  Solvency  II operating capital generation (SII OCG) 1 to Solvency II operating own funds  generation  (SII  OFG) 1 .  The  latter  more  directly  captures  the value created in a period, providing closer alignment to our growth strategy, and is also the numerator in our Solvency II return on equity (SII  RoE) 1 measure,  creating  alignment  across  incentive  plans.  The other  metrics,  annual  cash  remittances  and  Group  adjusted operating profit, remain unchanged, although we are adjusting some weightings  to  retain  an  appropriate  balance  between  growth  and cash/capital measures.\n\n## Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nThe LTIP is intended to (i) incentivise and reward senior executives for  delivering  Aviva's  long-term  objectives,  (ii)  align  them  with  the interests of shareholders, and (iii) encourage a focus on value growth. The current metrics of SII RoE 1 (with a SII shareholder cover ratio 1 ) and  relative  Total  Shareholder  Return  (TSR)  measured  against  a group of key peers remain key measures of our long-term success and are therefore being retained.\n\nTo  complement  these  metrics,  we  are  proposing  two  changes  to ensure  that  the  LTIP  supports  delivery  of  our  strategy.  The  first change  is  the  inclusion  of  a  new  long-term  cumulative  cash remittance metric to the financial element of the LTIP. The focus on longer-term  sustainable  cash  generation  becomes  fundamentally important  as  we  execute  on  our  strategic  priorities  to  focus  the portfolio  and  transform  performance.  This  has  been  reflected  in shareholder  feedback,  which  has  emphasised  the  importance  of delivering  on  our  long-term  dividend  ambitions  whilst  balancing short  term  cash  delivery  and  investment  in  the  business  to  drive sustainable  growth.  Cumulative  cash  remittances  are  established performance  measures  for  the  Group  and  have  been  targeted externally on a cumulative basis for a number of years. It is therefore proposed, that the existing SII RoE 1 financial measure be balanced by the inclusion of cumulative cash remittances 1 .",

Two key parts are our environmental and diversity and inclusion goals.\n\n- \u221e Climate change is an existential challenge and we would like to take a more prominent role in helping to solve these issues, for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and society. Through our investment  strategy  we  can  significantly  influence  the  biggest carbon emitters, and are putting in place a comprehensive climate strategy, including our announcement in March 2021 that we plan to become a Net Zero carbon emissions company by 2040\n- \u221e Creating a diverse, inclusive organisation is a fundamental part of living up to our purpose to ensure we represent the communities we serve and make decisions that reflect their needs\n\nTo recognise the importance of getting our approach right in these areas, for 2021 we are proposing to focus 10% of the LTIP on an ESG agenda. This will be split across three metrics:\n\n- \u221e % reduction in CO2 intensity of shareholders' assets\n- \u221e % of women in senior leadership roles in UK, Ireland and Canada\n- \u221e % of ethnic minority employees in senior leadership roles in the UK\n\nWe are proposing to retain the flexibility of the current Policy for up to  20%  of  the  LTIP  to  be  based  on  strategic  performance  metrics although  would  engage  with  shareholders  before  changing  the weighting in future years.\n\n## Other changes\n\nAdditionally, we are proposing minor changes to the Policy to ensure continued alignment with best practice and to incorporate actions the Committee took last year.\n\n- \u221e Pension - Formalise the current practice whereby ED provision is aligned with that available to the majority of the UK workforce\n- \u221e Post-cessation shareholding requirement - EDs will be required to hold their full shareholding requirement for two years following cessation\n- \u221e Shareholding  requirements -  To  increase  alignment  we  are increasing the Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO)'s shareholding requirement  from  200%  to  225%  of  salary  (the  Group  Chief Executive Officer (CEO)'s requirement is unchanged at 300%)\n- \u221e Malus and clawback provisions -  Strengthen the provisions to bring them into line with those in our internal policy\n\n## 2020 Company performance\n\nWhilst COVID-19 has disrupted a large portion of the industry, our results  demonstrate  the  fundamental  resilience  of  our  businesses and  demonstrate  our  disciplined  and  effective  response  during  a period of extreme uncertainty. We are proud of the hard work and commitment of our colleagues during this  unprecedented  period, helping  ensure  that  we  continue  to  provide  our  customers  with outstanding service and support.\n\nOur  initial  response  to  the  pandemic  was  one  of  prudence, suspending dividend payments and withdrawing senior management salary increases in April 2020. Dividend payments were subsequently re-instated in August and we are proud to say no UK Aviva colleagues were furloughed or made redundant as a result of the pandemic during the year.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for 2020\n\nWhile COVID-19 caused disruption and uncertainty for our business, no adjustments to performance metrics were made for any annual bonus or LTIP awards during the year.\n\n## 2020 Annual bonus\n\nThe  Committee  carefully  considered  Group,  business  unit  and individual  performance  during  2020  and  decided  that  the  bonus scorecard  should  be  capped  at  100%  to  reflect  shareholder experience  during  the  year  and  wider  societal  factors  caused  by COVID-19.\n\nIt  noted  the  impact  of  the  global  pandemic  and  the  decision  to suspend  the  dividend  in  April,  a  decision  based  on  prudence following  conversations  with  regulators,  rather  than  a  question  of affordability. Consequently, the initial formulaic outcome against the 2020 bonus scorecard prior to any adjustments was determined to be 116.55% (out of a maximum of 200%).\n\nThe  Committee  conducted  an  extensive  analysis  of  the  quality  of earnings, noting recommendations by the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee, and:\n\n- \u221e Approved  management's  proposal  to  cap  the  mechanical outcome of RIT to 'on target' (a 9.75% reduction) as it was a more balanced  view  of  risk  resolution  across  2020.  This  adjusted  the bonus scorecard from 116.55% to 106.8%\n- \u221e Made upward adjustments to the scorecard of 5% for employee engagement  and  5%  for  customer  trust  to  recognise  strong achievements under challenging conditions\n- \u221e Made a 5% downward adjustment to the scorecard for risk and controls. This recognised that while significant improvements had been made over the course of 2020, further work is required\n\nThis resulted in an adjusted scorecard outcome of 111.8% which has been capped at 100%.\n\nSince being appointed Group CEO in July 2020, Amanda Blanc has shown strong, decisive leadership and driven numerous significant actions in a short space of time. We have made a good start on the new strategy and there are clear signs that we are heading in the right direction. Jason Windsor steered the Group through the economic challenges of 2020 taking early and proactive action and provided critical support to the new Group CEO and Chair. Table 8 provides further detail on individual performance.\n\nAs a result, annual bonuses for Amanda and Jason were 120% and 100% of salary respectively.\n\n## 2018-20 LTIP\n\nAs a result of our performance over 2018-20, the 2018 LTIP lapsed in full.  This  reflected  below  threshold  performance  against  both  the adjusted  operating  earnings  per  share  (EPS) 1 and  the  relative  TSR targets.\n\n## Discretion\n\n- \u221e Discretion was applied in determining the annual bonus outcome, notably the decision to cap the bonus scorecard at 100% to align with the shareholder experience\n- \u221e LTIP - No discretion regarding the vesting outcome was exercised\n\nNevertheless, the impact of COVID-19 is seen in a number of areas across the business, including business interruption claims, reduced customer  activity  in  life  businesses,  lower  asset  values,  additional expenditure  on  operational  readiness,  and  risk  management initiatives. Our financial performance has been very resilient, despite the  direct  and  indirect  impact  of  COVID-19  and  we  made  good progress in reducing our expenses, though more needs to be done.",

She brings  her  extensive  insurance  industry  knowledge  gained  from  a long and successful career in the insurance sector.\n\nTaking into account our Policy and shareholder expectations, and reflecting Amanda's significant executive experience in the insurance sector,  the  Committee  determined  Amanda's  remuneration  as detailed below.\n\n- \u221e A salary of \u00a31 million per annum\n- \u221e Reimbursement  of  costs  associated  with  renting  suitable accommodation in London, up to an after-tax maximum of \u00a32,500 per month during the first 18 months of employment\n- \u221e Our  standard  benefits  package  for  EDs,  including  private  family medical insurance, life insurance, and reasonable travel benefits\n- \u221e Pension allowance of 14% of salary, aligned with the rate available to the majority of our UK workforce\n- \u221e A maximum annual bonus opportunity of 200% of salary, delivered one-third in cash and two-thirds in shares deferred over three years\n- \u221e For 2021, an award under the LTIP of 300% of basic salary\n- \u221e Amanda is also subject to a shareholding requirement of 300% of salary, which will continue for two years post-cessation\n\n## Departure of Maurice Tulloch\n\nMaurice stepped down as Group CEO with effect from 6 July 2020 in good leaver circumstances (as determined by the Committee in its discretion) for his outstanding awards under the Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) and LTIP.\n\nMaurice will be required to retain his shares held on departure for two years  following  cessation  of  employment  and  is  subject  to  postactivity restrictions which allow the Committee to reduce or recover awards if certain employment is taken elsewhere.\n\nWhile he remained eligible for a 2020 annual bonus in respect of the period up to and including 5 July 2020, when he left active service with  Aviva,  the  Committee  determined,  taking  all  factors  into account  including  Aviva's  performance  for  the  first  half  of  2020, shareholder experience during that period and the wider economic context, that Maurice would not receive a 2020 annual bonus.\n\n## Shareholder consultation\n\nIn addition  to  the  AGM  and  consultation  with  shareholders specifically on the Policy, the Chair and EDs meet with institutional shareholders  during  the  year  and  a  shareholder  newsletter  is published  quarterly  on  aviva.com.  Topics  raised  included  the suspension of dividend, the updated dividend policy and the Policy, which are covered elsewhere in this letter.\n\n## Committee changes during the year\n\nIn May 2020, George Culmer succeeded Sir Adrian Montague as Chair and therefore retired from the Committee. Patrick Flynn joined the Committee in June 2020, bringing with him significant experience in financial services. Pippa Lambert joined the Committee in January 2021. Pippa has significant experience in global financial services as a  HR professional and has an excellent record of delivery across a range of people strategies and transformation programmes.\n\nThe  Committee works hard to ensure alignment with shareholder interests,  and  over  the  last  year  has  dealt  with  a  number  of  time critical matters, including changes to the Board. I want to thank all Committee  members,  past  and  present,  for  their  dedication  and active participation.\n\n## Remuneration in 2021\n\n## Salary\n\nAlthough  2021  salary  budgets  were  increased  by  1.5%  for  junior colleagues, this did not apply to Aviva senior management. Amanda and Jason, therefore, did not receive salary increases in 2021.\n\n## 2021 Annual bonus and 2021-23 LTIP\n\nAward opportunities for 2021 are unchanged:\n\n|           | Annual bonus       | Annual bonus        | Annual bonus     |\n|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n|           | Target opportunity | Maximum opportunity | LTIP opportunity |\n| Group CEO | 100%               | 200%                | 300%             |\n| CFO       | 100%               | 150%                | 225%             |\n\nThe LTIP opportunities are lower than the scheme maximum which is 350%.\n\nProposed  changes  to  the  performance  metrics  and  assessment process for both plans are outlined above. A graphical summary and further details are shown in table 25. These changes will ensure that the  framework  remains  fit  for  purpose  and  best-placed  to  drive performance against our key financial and non-financial goals.\n\n## 2021 Focus areas\n\n2021 promises to be another busy year for the Committee, the focus of which is reviewing our workforce demographics.  While considerable efforts have been made in diversity and inclusion, we are particularly focussed on two priorities, gender and diversity. We are determined to keep challenging ourselves to do more to build a workplace and society that works for all.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  what  has  been  a  difficult  year,  Aviva  has  responded  well  and delivered resilient results against a challenging external backdrop. As a  Committee, we have sought to make decisions which effectively drive and support this progress, while continuing to align with UK best practice remuneration and governance expectations.\n\nI  hope that you find this report clear and informative, and that the Committee has your support for our Policy and Annual Report on Remuneration at our forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Patricia Cross\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 3 March 2021",

The  following  sections provide further context.\n\n## How does the proposed Policy align with Aviva's strategic priorities?\n\nThe Committee firmly believes that performance measures used in the  Policy  should  be  linked  to  the  Group's  Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other strategic priorities.\n\n| Group KPIs /  strategic   |                            | Financial KPIs focusing on economic value   | Financial KPIs focusing on economic value   | Financial KPIs focusing on economic value   | Financial KPIs focusing on economic value   | Financial KPIs focusing on economic value   | Shareholder  value creation   | Non-financial goals             | Non-financial goals   | Non-financial goals   | Non-financial goals          | Non-financial goals      |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| priorities                | Annual cash  remittances 1 | SII OFG 1                                   | Group  adjusted  operating  profit 2        | SII RoE 1                                   | Long-term  cumulative  cash  remittances 1  | SII   shareholder  cover ratio 1            | TSR                           | RIT and risk  controls  quality | Employee  engagement  | Customer NPS          | Carbon  emissions  reduction | Diversity and  inclusion |\n| Annual bonus              | 30%  25%                   |                                             | 15%                                         |                                             |                                             |                                             |                               | 15%                             | 5%                    | 5% RNPS  5% TNPS      |                              |                          |\n| LTIP                      |                            |                                             |                                             | 22.5%                                       | 22.5%                                       | Underpin                                    | 45%                           |                                 |                       |                       | 5%                           | 5%                       |\n\n## Annual Bonus & LTIP metric aims\n\nThe  annual  bonus  metrics  are  comprised  of  a  balanced  set  of financial and non-financial measures aligned to the key annual goals supporting our strategy. The financial metrics underpin our dividend, measure the value created in the period as well as our profitability, and the non-financial metrics complement the delivery of broader strategic goals.\n\nThe  LTIP  metrics  support  delivery  of  sustained  performance  and value growth, aligned to our strategic priorities and the interest of shareholders.  The  financial  metrics  measure  longer  term  value creation, and underpin our sustainable dividend policy.\n\n## Clarity\n\n- \u221e Our remuneration framework is structured to  support  the  financial  and  strategic objectives  of  the  Company,  aligning  the interests of our EDs with those of shareholders\n- \u221e We are committed to transparent communication with all our stakeholders, including shareholders - further details of our engagement process for the Policy are set  out  under  the  consideration  of  wider colleague  pay  and  shareholder  views section\n\n## Predictability\n\n- \u221e The  Policy  sets  out  the  possible  future value  of  remuneration  which  EDs  could receive, including the impact of share price appreciation  of  50%  - see  under  the illustration of the Policy for further details\n\n## Simplicity\n\n- \u221e We operate a simple remuneration framework, comprising fixed pay elements, along  with  short-  and  long-term  variable elements\n- \u221e This  structure  provides  clear  line  of  sight for both executives and shareholders\n- \u221e The  annual  bonus  and  LTIP  are  focused, rewarding performance against key measures of success for the business\n\n## Proportionality\n\n- \u221e There  is  clear  alignment  between  the performance  of  the  Company  and  the rewards available to EDs\n- \u221e Incentive  elements  are  closely  aligned  to our strategic goals, transparent and robustly  assessed,  with  the  Committee having  full  discretion  to  adjust  outcomes to  ensure  they  align  with  overall  Aviva performance\n\nThe inclusion of a cumulative cash remittance measure emphasises the importance of delivering on our long-term dividend ambitions whilst  balancing  short  term  cash  delivery  and  investment  in  the business to drive long-term growth. TSR directly measures the value we create for shareholders and the non-financial metrics will enable Aviva take a more prominent role in society by focusing on climate change issues and diversity and inclusion.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code's six principles when it determines remuneration policy.\n\nThe Committee's view is that the framework at Aviva is well-aligned with these areas.\n\n## Risk\n\n- \u221e Our reward structure aligns with the Company's risk management framework\n- \u221e Long-term alignment is achieved through a number  of  means,  including  three-year deferral under  the  annual  bonus,  the two-year holding period on LTIP awards, and our withinand post-employment shareholding guidelines\n- \u221e Both plans also incorporate robust performance  targets,  malus  and  clawback provisions, and overarching Committee discretion  to  adjust  formulaic  outcomes, providing  shareholders  with  comfort  that any risk events are appropriately reflected in remuneration outcomes\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- \u221e We  are  committed  to  effective  stakeholder and colleague engagement\n- \u221e As  part  of  this,  the  Committee  regularly reviews  data  relating  to  pay  and  broader employment  conditions  in  the  workforce, and takes these into account when considering executive remuneration",

Shareholders were consulted  extensively  during  the  recent  Policy  review,  and  the Committee is grateful for their feedback and challenge.\n\n## Our colleagues' views\n\nThe  Committee  has  sight  of  colleague  views  on  remuneration through the colleague opinion survey (Voice of Aviva) and colleague forums, input from the People function during Committee meetings and  the  Evolution  Council,  chaired  by  the  Chair.  The  Evolution Council consists of a diverse group of high calibre leaders from across the  business  who  discuss  a  range  of  topics  related  to  the  Group strategy and input into final decisions. When determining the Policy and arrangements for EDs, the Committee also reviews:\n\n- \u221e Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure reward  structures  are  suitably  aligned  and  that  levels  of remuneration remain appropriate as set out below table 18. Other considerations include:\n- -The ratio of CEO pay to that of employees (see table 17 and 18);\n- -Changes  in  remuneration  (salary,  benefits  and  bonus)  of  UK employees with that of Directors (see table 14);\n- -Spend  on  pay  compared  with,  for  example  operating  profit, dividends (see table 19); and\n- -Gender pay gap. We released our third gender pay gap review in January 2021, along with details of actions we are taking to drive change  and  close  the  gap.

We work hard to recognise the individual needs of colleagues and in this context, we are proud of our  reward,  benefits  and  overall  support  offering  and  apply principles consistent with how we pay our EDs:\n\n- \u221e We  aim  for  transparency  and  a  fair  cascade  of  remuneration throughout  the  Group  by  sharing  our  pay  ranges  with  our colleagues. We decided to increase salary budgets for 2021 by 1.5% for  junior  grades  as  we  believed  that  allowed  leaders  to  deliver remuneration fairly,  while  balancing  the  need  for  prudence  at  a time of economic uncertainty\n- \u221e We regularly review our salary ranges to maintain competitiveness to market rates, and we move everyone who may be below a band to at least the minimum of that range each year\n- \u221e We  have  a  structured  salary  progression  for  our  frontline colleagues,  providing  incremental  salary  increases  over  the  first few years in role as individuals develop and gain experience.  As well  as  being  a  Living  Wage  employer,  this  demonstrates  our commitment to improving the salaries of the least well-paid people in Aviva\n- -Carers - We continue to provide colleagues up to 35 hours paid leave per year to help balance caring responsibilities with work. Over 600 UK colleagues used this scheme in 2020; and\n- \u221e We have a market-leading benefits offering:\n- -Parental leave - We offer up to 12 months' parental leave in the UK, including 26 weeks at full pay regardless of parent gender. We are proud that 97% of new dads at Aviva took more than two weeks' leave, with an average of five months. We also provide half a day's leave when a child is starting a new school.\n- \u221e Our competitive pension scheme provides an employer contribution  of  14%  of  salary  (subject  to  the  level  of  colleague contribution)\n- \u221e We ensure that colleagues can share in the success of the business, where appropriate, through performance-based variable remuneration\n- \u221e UK  colleagues  are  eligible  to  participate  in  our  Aviva  Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2020 (SAYE) and All Employee Share Ownership Plan (AESOP) offerings with similar plans operating for many of our overseas colleagues. We are proud of the participation rates in these plans, with over 60% participating in the SAYE and over 70% in the AESOP\n\n## How we support our colleagues\n\nWe recognise that 2020 was clearly a difficult year in many respects; although  all  our  colleagues  felt  the  impact  of  COVID-19  in  their personal  and  professional  lives,  they  continued  to  provide  our customers with outstanding service and commitment. We felt that it was important to recognise that our colleagues have gone above and beyond for our customers during a challenging period. Therefore, in addition to the regular annual bonus, and in direct recognition of the impact  of  COVID-19,  Aviva  rolled  out  a  series  of  initiatives  to recognise  colleagues'  hard  work  during  the  challenges  due  to COVID-19,  including  a  festive  thank-you  voucher  of  \u00a3100  for  UK colleagues.\n\nA  range  of  tools  is  also  available  to  assist  our  colleagues  through challenging times such as:\n\n- \u221e DigiCare+, a smartphone app to help detect, manage and prevent physical  and  mental  health  problems,  is  available  free  to colleagues\n- \u221e Free  access  to  wellbeing  apps,  Headspace  and  Thrive  that  help build overall resilience\n- \u221e #backtobest,  a  wellbeing  campaign  where  colleagues  can  earn points for doing things that are good for them, like being active or meditating\n- \u221e Flexible  working  available  for  all  our  people.  Since  the  first lockdown we have paid, and will continue to pay, all our people in full, regardless of the hours they are able to work\n\nWe will continue to help and support our colleagues, and ensure that they feel valued, motivated, and rewarded over the course of 2021 and beyond.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report > Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThe  proposed  Remuneration  Policy  for  directors  is  set  out  in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) and the Large & Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts  and  Reports)  Regulations  2008  (as  amended)  and  is subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM on 6 May 2021. If approved, it will apply immediately, for up to three years.\n\nThe  key  changes  between  this  Policy  and  the  current  Policy  as approved at the 2018 AGM are detailed below.\n\n- \u221e LTIP - The current Policy provides for up to 20% of the LTIP to be based on strategic performance metrics. For 2021, ESG metrics will comprise  10%  of  the  LTIP  (we  would  engage  with  shareholders before changing the weighting in future years)\n- \u221e Pension - The Policy formalises the current position whereby ED provision is aligned with that available to the majority of the UK workforce (14% of salary)\n- \u221e Shareholding  requirements  -  To  promote  alignment  we  are increasing the CFO's shareholding requirement from 200% to 225% of salary (the CEO's requirement is unchanged at 300%)\n- \u221e Post-employment  shareholding  requirements  -  From  2021,  EDs will have to hold their full shareholding requirement for two years following departure\n- \u221e Post-activity  restrictions  -  Retirees  are  subject  to  post-activity restrictions which mean LTIP and deferred bonus awards can be reduced or recovered if certain employment is taken elsewhere\n- \u221e Malus  and  clawback  -  Malus  and  clawback  triggers  have  been strengthened  to  include  events  which  lead  to  corporate  failure, aligning  the  provisions  with  those  of  our  internal  malus  and clawback policy\n\n## Alignment of Group strategy with executive remuneration\n\nThe  Committee considers  that  alignment  between  Group  strategy and the remuneration of its EDs is critical. The Policy provides market competitive remuneration, and incentivises EDs to achieve both the annual business plan and the longer-term strategic objectives of the Group.  Significant  levels  of  deferral  and  within-  and  postemployment  shareholding  requirements  align  EDs'  interests  with those of shareholders and aid retention of key personnel. As well as rewarding the achievement of objectives, variable remuneration can be  zero  if  performance  thresholds  are  not  met.  Remuneration payments to directors can only be made if they are consistent with the approved Policy.\n\nTable  1  below  provides  an  overview  of  the  Policy  for  EDs.  For  an overview of the Policy for NEDs, see table 3.\n\n## Table 1 Key aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors\n\n## Element\n\n## Basic salary\n\nNo changes proposed\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nNo changes proposed\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo  provide  core  market  related  pay  to  attract  and  retain  the required level of talent.\n\n## Operation\n\nAnnual review, with changes normally taking effect from 1 April each year. The review is informed by:\n\n- \u221e Levels of increase for the broader employee population\n- \u221e Individual and business performance\n- \u221e Relevant pay data including market practice among relevant FTSE listed companies of comparable size to Aviva in terms of market  capitalisation,  large  European  and  global  insurers, and UK financial services companies\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo reward EDs for achievement against the Company's strategic objectives  and  for  demonstrating  the  Aviva  values  and behaviours.\n\nDeferral provides alignment with shareholder interests and aids retention of key personnel.\n\n## Operation\n\nAwards  are  based  on  performance  in  the  year.  Targets  are normally set annually and pay-out levels are determined by the Committee based on performance against those targets and a quality of earnings assessment and risk review.\n\n## Form and timing of payment\n\n- \u221e Two-thirds  of  any  bonus  awarded  is  deferred  into  shares which vest in three equal annual tranches\n- \u221e One-third of any bonus is payable in cash at the end of the year\n\nAdditional  shares  are  awarded  at  vesting  in  lieu  of  dividends paid on the deferred shares.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nCash and deferred awards are subject to malus and clawback. Details of when these may be applied are set out in the notes below.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nThere is no maximum increase within the Policy. However, basic salary increases take account of the average basic salary increase awarded to the broader employee population. Different levels of increase may be agreed in certain circumstances at the Committee's discretion, such as:\n\n- \u221e Development of the individual in the role\n- \u221e An increase in job scope and responsibility\n- \u221e A significant increase in the size, value or complexity of the Group\n\n## Assessment of performance\n\nAny movement in basic salary takes account of the performance of the individual and the Group.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\n200% of basic salary for Group CEO 150% of basic salary for other EDs\n\n## Outcome at threshold and on target\n\nPerformance  is assessed against multiple metrics. Threshold performance against a single metric would result in a bonus payment of no more than 25% of basic salary.\n\n100% of basic salary is payable for on target performance.\n\n## Assessment of performance\n\nPerformance  is  assessed  against  a  range  of  relevant  financial, employee,  customer  and  risk  targets  designed  to  incentivise  the achievement of our strategy, as well as individual strategic objectives as set by the Committee.\n\nAlthough  financial  performance  is  the  major  factor  in  considering overall  expenditure  on  bonuses,  performance  against  non-financial measures  including  progress  towards  our  strategic  priorities  and behaviours in line with our values will also be taken into consideration.\n\n## Discretion\n\nSee notes to this table.",

Vesting is subject to an assessment  of  quality  of  earnings,  the  stewardship  of  capital and risk review.\n\n## Performance period\n\nThree years. Additional shares are awarded at vesting in lieu of dividends on any shares which vest.\n\n## Additional holding period\n\nTwo years.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nAwards  are  subject  to  malus  and  clawback.  Details  of  when these may be applied are set out in the notes below.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo  give  a  market  competitive  level  of  provision  for  postretirement income.\n\n## Operation\n\nEDs are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan up to the annual limit.\n\nAny amounts above annual or lifetime limits are paid in cash.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo  provide  EDs  with  a  suitable  but  reasonable  package  of benefits  as  part  of  a  competitive  remuneration  package.  This involves  both  core  executive  benefits,  and  the  opportunity  to participate  in  flexible  benefits  programmes  offered  by  the Company (via salary sacrifice).\n\nThis  enables  us  to  attract  and  retain  the  right  level  of  talent necessary to deliver the Company's strategy.\n\n## Operation\n\nBenefits are provided on a market related basis. The Company reserves the right to deliver benefits to EDs depending on their individual  circumstances,  which  may  include  a  cash  car allowance, life insurance, private medical insurance and access to a company car and driver for business use. In the case of nonUK  executives,  the  Committee  may  consider  additional allowances in line with standard relevant market practice. EDs are eligible  to  participate  in  the  Company's  broad  based employee  share  plans  on  the  same  basis  as  other  eligible\n\nemployees.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo  assist  with  mobility  across  the  Group  to  ensure  the appropriate talent is available to execute strategy locally.\n\n## Operation\n\nEDs  who  are  relocated  or  reassigned  from  one  location  to another  receive  relevant  benefits  to  assist  them  and  their dependants in moving home and settling into the new location.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo align EDs' interests with those of shareholders.\n\n## Operation\n\nA  requirement  to  build  a  shareholding  in  the  Company equivalent to 300% of basic salary for the Group CEO and 225% for other EDs.\n\nThis shareholding is normally to be built up over a period not exceeding 5 years (subject to the Committee's discretion where personal circumstances dictate).\n\nPost-cessation  shareholding  requirements  also  apply  to  EDs being the lower of 300% of basic salary for the Group CEO and 225%  for  other  EDs,  or  the  holding  on  termination  of employment, for two years post-cessation.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\n350% of basic salary.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nAwards  will  vest  based  on  a  combination  of  financial,  TSR  and strategic performance metrics. The Policy provides for a minimum aggregate weighting of 80% for financial metrics and TSR and for up to  20%  to  be  based  on  strategic  performance  metrics.  We  would engage with shareholders before changing metrics or weighting in future years.\n\nFor the 2021 awards the measures and weightings will be:\n\n- \u221e 22.5% Cumulative cash remittances 1\n- \u221e 22.5% Solvency II RoE 1\n- \u221e 45% TSR against a comparator group\n- \u221e 10% ESG measures\n\n## Vesting at threshold\n\nThreshold vesting for all metrics is 20%.\n\n## Discretion\n\nSee notes to this table.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nIf suitable employee contributions are made, the Company contributes 14%  of  basic  salary  for  all  EDs,  aligned  to  the  rate  available  to  the majority of the UK workforce.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nSet  at  a  level  which  the  Committee  considers  appropriate  against comparable  roles  in  companies  of  a  similar  size  and  complexity  to provide a reasonable level of benefit.\n\nCosts  would  normally  be  limited  to  providing  a  cash  car  allowance, private  medical  insurance,  life  insurance,  and  reasonable  travel benefits  (including  the  tax  cost  where  applicable).  In  addition,  there may be one-off or exceptional items on a case by case basis, which would be disclosed in the DRR.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nDependent on location and family size, benefits are market related and time bound. They are not compensated for performing the role but to defray costs of a relocation or residence outside the home country. The  Committee  would  reward  no  more  than  it  judged  reasonably necessary, in the light of all applicable circumstances.",

        "page_content": "Directors' Remuneration Report > Directors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\n## Notes to the table:\n\n## Performance measures\n\nFor the annual bonus, performance measures are chosen to align to the Group's KPIs and include financial, strategic, risk, employee and customer  measures.  Achievement  against  individual  strategic objectives is also taken into account.\n\nLTIP performance measures are chosen to provide an indication of both  absolute  and  relative  return  generated  for  shareholders.  In terms of target setting, a number of reference points are taken into account each year including, but not limited to, the Group's business plan and external market expectations of the Company. Maximum payouts  require  performance  that  significantly  exceeds  expected performance under both the annual bonus and the LTIP.\n\n## Quality of earnings assessments\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee engages in a regular quality of earnings assessment. A quality of earnings assessment sign-off is the final step in determining annual bonus scorecard outcomes, and is performed  before  vesting  is  determined  against  financial  metrics under the LTIP.\n\nAs  a  minimum,  at  any  Committee  meeting  where  LTIP  vesting  or annual  bonus  scorecard  decisions  are  considered,  the  Chief Financial  Controller  prepares  a  report  to  the  Committee  on  the quality  of  earnings  reflected  in  the  results  being  assessed,  against performance  targets.  Extensive  information  from  the  audited accounts is used to explain the vesting and scorecard outcomes ranging from movements in reserves, capital management decisions, consistency  of  accounting  treatment  and  period  to  period comparability. The Chief Financial Controller attends the Committee meeting to answer any questions that any member of the Committee may choose to ask. Any vesting decision or confirmation of awards is made after this process has been undertaken.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nThe  circumstances  when  malus  (the  forfeiture  or  reduction  of unvested shares awarded under the ABP and LTIP) and clawback (the recovery of cash and share awards after release) may apply include (but  are  not  limited  to)  where  the  Committee  considers  that  the employee  concerned  has  been  involved  in  or  partially/wholly responsible for:\n\n- \u221e A materially adverse misstatement (as defined by the Board) of the Company's financial statements, or a misleading representation of performance;\n- \u221e A significant failure of risk management and/or controls;\n- \u221e A scenario or event which causes material reputational damage to the Company;\n- \u221e A scenario or event which causes material corporate failure;\n- \u221e Any regulatory investigation or breach of laws, rules or codes of conduct;\n- \u221e Misconduct which, in the opinion of the Committee, ought to result in the complete or partial lapse of an award;\n- \u221e Conduct  which  resulted  in  significant  loss(es)  or  summary termination of employment;\n- \u221e Failure to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety;\n- \u221e A material error (as defined by the Board) in the calculation of a financial or non-financial performance metric used to determine the  outcome  of  variable  pay,  or  any  other  error  or  material misstatement that results in overpayment to employees;\n- \u221e Any  circumstances  determined  by  the  Board  that  mean  the underlying financial health of the Group or member of the Group has  significantly deteriorated, resulting in severe  financial constraints which preclude or limit the ability to fund variable pay;\n- \u221e Any other circumstance required by local regulatory obligations or, in  the  Board's  opinion,  justifies  the  reduction  or  repayment  of variable pay.\n\nThe clawback period runs for two years from the date of payment in the case of the cash element of any annual bonus award.\n\nFor deferred bonus elements and LTIP awards, the overall malus and clawback period is five years from the date of grant.\n\n## Discretions\n\nThe discretions the Committee has in relation to the operation of the ABP and LTIP are set out in the plan rules. In relation to the outcomes under these plans, the Committee has unfettered discretion to adjust upward  or  downward  (including  to  nil)  the  mechanical  outcome where it considers that:\n\n- \u221e The  outcome  does  not  reflect  the  underlying  financial  or  nonfinancial  performance  of  the  participant  or  the  Group  over  the relevant period;\n- \u221e The outcome is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at the award date;\n- \u221e There exists any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate; and/or\n- \u221e It  is  appropriate to do so, taking into account a range of factors, including the management of risk and good governance and, in all cases, the experience of shareholders.\n\nOther  discretions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  ability  to  set additional conditions and the discretion to change or waive those conditions. Such discretions would only be applied in exceptional circumstances,  to  ensure  that  awards  properly  reflect  underlying business performance. Any use of the discretions and how they were exercised will be disclosed, where relevant, in the DRR and, where appropriate, be subject to consultation with Aviva's shareholders.\n\n## Change in control\n\nIn the event of a change in control, unless a new award is granted in exchange for an existing award, or if there is a significant corporate event like a demerger, awards under the LTIP would normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied as at the date of the change in control, and unless the Committee decides otherwise, would be pro-rated to reflect the time between the date of  grant  and  the  change  in  control  event.  Awards  under  the  ABP would normally vest on the date of the change in control and may vest if there is a significant corporate event.\n\n## Consistency of executive Policy across the Group\n\nThe  Policy  for  our  EDs  is  designed  as  part  of  the  remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group. Remuneration arrangements for employees below the EDs take  account  of  the  seniority  and  nature  of  the  role,  individual performance and local market practice. The components and levels of  remuneration for different employees may therefore differ from the Policy for EDs.\n\nAny  such  elements  are  reviewed  against  market  practice  and approved in line with internal guidelines and frameworks.\n\nDifferentiation  in  reward  outcomes  based  on  performance  and behaviour that is consistent with the Aviva values is a feature of how Aviva  operates  its  annual  bonus  plan  for  its  senior  leaders  and managers globally. A disciplined approach is taken to moderation across  the  Company  in  order  to  recognise  and  reward  the  key contributors.  The  allocation  of  LTIP  awards  also  involves  strong differentiation, with expected contribution and ability to collaborate effectively in implementation of the strategy driving award levels.",

        "page_content": "Directors' Remuneration Report > Directors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\n## Legacy payments\n\nThe  Committee  reserves  the  right  to  make  any  remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions  available  to  it  in  connection  with  such  payments) notwithstanding  that  they  are  not  in  line  with  the  Policy  set  out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before May 2014 (the date the Company's first Policy came into effect), (ii) before the Policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the Policy in force at the time they were agreed, or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment  was  not  in  consideration  for  the  individual  becoming  a director  of  the  Company.  For  these  purposes,  'payments'  includes the  Committee satisfying  awards  of  variable  remuneration  and,  in relation  to  an  award  over  shares,  the  terms  of  the  payment  are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Approach to recruitment remuneration\n\nOn  hiring  a  new  ED,  the  Committee  would  align  the  proposed remuneration package with the Policy in place for EDs at the time of the appointment.\n\nIn determining the actual remuneration for a new ED, the Committee would consider the package in totality, taking into account elements such  as  the  skills  and  experience  of  the  individual,  local  market benchmarks, remuneration practice, and the existing remuneration of  other  senior  executives.  The  Committee  would  ensure  any arrangements agreed would be in the best interests of Aviva and its shareholders. It would seek not to pay more than necessary to secure the right candidate.\n\nWhere considered appropriate the Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to 'buyout' remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee would take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which it was paid (e.g.  cash  or  shares)  and  the  timeframe  of  awards.  Buyout  awards would be awarded on a 'like for like' basis compared to remuneration being  forfeited,  and  would  be  capped  to  reflect  the  value  being forfeited.  The  Committee  considers  that  a  buyout  award  is  a significant  investment  in  human  capital  by  Aviva,  and  any  buyout decision will involve careful consideration of the contribution that is expected from the individual.\n\nThe maximum level of variable pay which could be awarded to a new ED, excluding any buyouts, would be in line with the Policy set out above and would therefore be no more than 550% of basic salary for the Group CEO (200% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant) and 500% of basic  salary  for  other  EDs  (150%  of  basic  salary  annual  bonus opportunity  and  350%  of  basic  salary  as  the  face  value  of  a  LTIP grant).\n\nAll other elements of remuneration will also be in line with the Policy set out above.\n\nShould the Company have any prior commitments outside of this Policy  in  respect  of  an  employee  promoted  internally  to  an  ED position, the Committee may continue to honour these for a period of time. Where an ED is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an ED is appointed following Aviva's acquisition of, or merger with, another company, legacy terms and conditions may be honoured.\n\nOn  appointing  a  new  NED,  the  Committee  would  align  the remuneration package with the Policy for NEDs, outlined in table 3, including fees and travel benefits.\n\n## Illustration of the Policy\n\nThe charts below illustrate how much EDs could earn under different performance scenarios in one financial year:\n\n- \u221e Minimum - basic salary,  pension  or  cash  in  lieu  of  pension  and benefits, no bonus and no vesting of the LTIP\n- \u221e Target - basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension, benefits, and:\n- -A  bonus  of  100%  and  an  LTIP  of  225%  of  basic  salary  (with notional LTIP vesting at 50% of maximum) for the CFO.\n- -A  bonus  of  100%  and  an  LTIP  of  300%  of  basic  salary  (with notional LTIP vesting at 50% of maximum) for the Group CEO; and\n- \u221e Maximum  -  basic  salary,  pension  or  cash  in  lieu  of  pension, benefits, and:\n- -A  bonus  of  150%  and  an  LTIP  of  225%  of  basic  salary  (with notional LTIP vesting at maximum) for the CFO.\n- -A  bonus  of  200%  and  an  LTIP  of  300%  of  basic  salary  (with notional LTIP vesting at maximum) for the Group CEO; and\n- \u221e Maximum  with  share  price  increase  -  indicative  maximum remuneration, assuming a notional LTIP vesting at maximum and share price appreciation of 50% on the LTIP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNotes to the charts\n\nThe charts are illustrative only and the actual value EDs could earn is subject to business performance and share price movement to the date of vesting of the LTIP and of the deferred share element of the annual bonus. Fixed pay consists of basic salary, pension as described in table 1, and estimated value of benefits provided under the Remuneration Policy, excluding any one offs. Actual figures may vary in future years. The value of the deferred element of the annual bonus assumes a constant share price and does not include additional shares awarded in lieu of dividends that may have been accrued during the vesting period. The value of the LTIP assumes a constant share price (with the exception of the maximum with share price increase scenario) and does not include additional shares awarded in lieu of dividends that may have been accrued during the vesting period.\n\nThe LTIP is as proposed to be awarded in 2021, which would vest in 2023, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. The shares would then be subject to a further two-year holding period.",

The  Committee  has  the  ability  to  exercise  its discretion  on  the  final  amount  actually  paid.  Any  compensation would  be  based  on  basic  salary,  pension  entitlement  and  other contractual benefits during the notice period, or a payment made in lieu of notice, depending on whether the notice is worked.\n\nWhere notice of termination of a contract is given, payments to the ED would continue for the period worked during the notice period. Alternatively, the contract may be terminated, and phased monthly payments made in lieu of notice for,  or  for  the  balance  of,  the  12 months' notice period. During this period, EDs would be expected to mitigate their loss by seeking alternative employment. Payments in lieu  of  notice  would  be  reduced  by  the  salary  received  from  any alternative  employment,  potentially  to  zero.  The  Company  would typically make a reasonable contribution towards an ED's legal fees in connection with advice on the terms of their departure.\n\nThere is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus for the year in which loss of office occurs. The Committee may determine that an ED  may  receive  a  pro-rata  bonus  in  respect  of  the  period  of employment  during  the  year  loss  of  office  occurs  based  on  an assessment of performance. Where an ED leaves the Company by reason  of  death,  disability  or  ill  health,  or  any  other  reason determined by the Committee, there may be a payment of a pro rata bonus for the relevant year at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nThe treatment of leavers under the ABP and LTIP is determined by the rules of the relevant plans. Good leaver status under these plans would be granted in the event of, for example, the death of an ED. Good leaver status for other leaving reasons is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individual's departure, but would typically include planned retirement, or their departure on ill health grounds.\n\nIn circumstances where good leaver status has been granted, awards may  still  be  subject  to  malus  and  clawback  in  the  event  that inappropriate  conduct  of  the  ED  is  subsequently  discovered  post\n\ndeparture, and retirees are subject to post-activity restrictions which allow  the  Committee  to  reduce  or  recover  awards  if  certain employment is taken elsewhere. If good leaver status is not granted, all outstanding awards will lapse.\n\nIn the case of LTIPs, where the Committee determines EDs to be good leavers,  vesting  is  normally  based  on  the  extent  to  which performance conditions have been met at the end of the relevant performance period, and the proportion of the award that vests is pro-rated for the time from the date of grant to final date of service (unless the Committee decides otherwise). Any decision not to apply this would only be made in exceptional circumstances and would be fully disclosed. It is not the practice to allow such treatment.\n\n## Consideration of wider employee pay and shareholder views\n\n- \u221e Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure that  pay  structures  are  suitably  aligned  and  that  levels  of remuneration remain appropriate. The Committee reviews levels of basic salary increases for other employees and executives based on their respective locations. It reviews changes in overall bonus pool  funding  and  long-term  incentive  grants.  The  Committee considers  feedback  on  pay  matters  from  sources  including  the employee opinion survey and employee forums. The Committee also  takes  into  account  information  provided  by  the  people function  and  external  advisers  and  the  Committee  Chair  has  in place a programme of consultation and meetings with employee forums  including  trade  union,  Your  Forum  and  the  Evolution Council to discuss remuneration; and\n\nWhen  determining  the  Policy  and  arrangements  for  our  EDs,  the Committee considers:\n\n- \u221e In  its  ongoing  dialogue  with  shareholders,  the  Committee  seeks shareholder  views  and  takes  them  into  account  when  any significant changes  are being proposed  to  remuneration arrangements and when formulating and implementing the Policy.\n\nFor example, there has been detailed engagement with our largest shareholders regarding the proposed Policy during 2020, continuing into 2021.",

Committee\n\nElement of the Reward Governance Framework managed mainly under delegated authority from the Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee believes that our remuneration framework is clear and transparent and aligned with our culture. We operate a simple incentive framework of an annual bonus and LTIP. Award levels are capped with pay-out linked to performance against a limited number of  measures  that  are  aligned  to  our  strategy.  Stretching  but  fair targets are set. This ensures that potential reward outcomes are clear and  aligned  with  the  performance  achieved,  with  the  Committee having  the  discretion  to  adjust  outcomes  where  this  is  not considered to be the case.\n\nPay levels are set taking into account internal and external reference points to ensure that pay is competitive while remaining equitable within the Company. A number of additional factors are in place to mitigate reputational and other risks, including malus and clawback provisions, unfettered discretion, a two-year holding period on LTIP awards,  and  both  within  and  post-employment  shareholding guidelines.",

For Maurice, following his appointment as Group CEO on 4 March 2019 and for Jason the total was 12.34% of basic salary (pension contribution of 14% which is reduced for the effect of employers' National Insurance contributions when paid as cash). For former EDs (and Maurice prior to his appointment as Group CEO) the aggregate total was 28% of basic salary. No ED has prospective entitlement to benefit in a defined benefit scheme.\n- 4 Bonus payable in respect of the financial year including any deferred element at the face value at the date of award. EDs are required to defer two-thirds of any bonus awarded into Aviva shares. The deferred element is made under the ABP and will vest in equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversary of the award date, subject to continued employment. ABP awards will be granted to EDs after the 2021 AGM so will be made under the proposed Policy. The grant will be made using the same share price as if they were granted in March, in line with other employees.\n- 5 For Maurice, the value of the LTIP for 2020 relates to the 2018 award, which had a three-year performance period ending 31 December 2020. 0% of the award will vest in March 2021. The LTIP amounts shown in last year's report in respect of the LTIPs awarded in 2017 were calculated with an assumed vesting share price of 411.20 pence. The actual share price at vesting was 268.5 pence, and the table has been updated to reflect this change. The estimated value of the awards for the EDs was \u00a3670,000; the actual value was \u00a3466,000 (decrease of \u00a3204,000). Jason, prior to becoming an ED, was granted Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) awards. These awards do not have performance conditions. In accordance with the regulations a pro-rated amount for 2019 is shown in respect of qualifying services during the year, using the share price at grant to determine the value of the award.\n- 6 Amanda was appointed as Group CEO on 6 July 2020.\n- 7 Jason was appointed to the Board on 26 September 2019. For 2019, the values relate to the period while he was an ED.\n- 8 Maurice stepped down from the Board on 6 July 2020; values for 2020 relate to the period while he was an ED. Details of Maurice's leaving arrangements and bonus are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report under the heading Departure of Maurice Tulloch and in this Annual Report on Remuneration under Payments for loss of office (after table 12).\n- 9 Year on year increase is primarily due to 2019 figures only reflecting part-year remuneration for Jason, although offset by nil vesting of the 2018 LTIP.\n\n## Additional disclosures in respect of the single total figure of remuneration table\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nAs part of the annual pay review process, the Committee has considered whether any recovery or withholding under the malus and clawback provisions of Aviva's incentive plans is required by any current circumstances.\n\nNo incidents concerning the EDs are currently subject to action under Aviva's Malus and Clawback policy.\n\n## Other items of remuneration\n\nThe EDs have not received any items in the nature of remuneration other than those disclosed in table 1.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nAs referenced in the Chairs' Governance letter, in line with the comments made at the 2018 AGM, in October 2020 a committee of the board, consisting of the Chair, senior independent NED and the Group CEO, instructed Allen & Overy LLP to conduct a review of the remuneration decisions that had previously been taken in light of the preference shares matter. The scope of the review included a review of all relevant documentation and discussions with key individuals involved in the decisions.\n\nAllen & Overy's review has concluded that the adjustments the Committee decided to apply to the relevant EDs variable remuneration, which we  announced  in  2019,  were  reasonable  in  the  circumstances  and  that  these  adjustments  were  applied  after  careful  and  thorough consideration by the Committee. The review has also confirmed that, taking into account the FCA's decision, there was no reasonable basis for further adjustments to be made to the relevant EDs variable remuneration in relation to the preference shares matter. In addition, it concluded that there was no basis for Aviva to make any adjustments to the fees of the relevant NEDs in light of the preference shares matter.\n\nThe Committee has discussed, considered and accepted the findings of the review.",

Taking into account the impact of the outcome of the quality of earnings assessment and the non-financial modifiers, although the Committee is of the view that these outcomes appropriately reflect the overall performance of Aviva during the year, the outturn (before any individual adjustments) should be capped at 100% to align with the experience of shareholders and reflect wider societal factors caused by the global pandemic.\n\n## 2018 LTIP vesting in respect of performance period 2018-2020\n\nThe Operating EPS 1 and TSR 2 outcome for the 2018 LTIP are detailed in the table below. 0% of the award will vest in March 2021.

As it was not clear when more normal conditions would resume, the Committee decided to grant the 2020 LTIP award at the normal opportunity for our EDs, but committed to review the outcome at vesting to determine whether there had been windfall gains as a result of the award being made at an artificially depressed share price. The award documentation was drafted to provide the Committee with the discretion to make an adjustment should it be considered appropriate.\n\nWe recognise the wish from shareholders and proxy advisory bodies for companies to be clear about how the use of discretion would be assessed and exercised in practice. For these purposes, the Committee has agreed that factors to be considered in making the assessment will include:\n\n- \u221e The relationship between the 2020 grant price and those used in previous years, and the resultant impact on the number of shares under award;\n- \u221e The extent to which COVID-19 continues to have an impact on market valuations and volatility.\n- \u221e An analysis of share price performance prior to and following grant, with a focus on:\n- -Performance vs. other Insurance firms; and\n- -Performance vs. the broader market;\n- -Share price growth over the 2020 LTIP performance period vs. that for prior LTIP awards.\n- \u221e Broader performance context, including financial and non-financial results, and progress against strategic and operational priorities.\n\nFull details of the outcome of the assessment will be provided in our 2022 DRR.",

Three-year targets are set annually within the context of the Company's strategic plan. The 2020 targets are provided below.\n\n## Table 11  2020 LTIP SII RoE 1 targets (audited information)\n\nTable 12  TSR vesting schedule for the 2020 LTIP award (audited information)\n\n| Achievement of SII RoE 1  targets over the three-year performance period   | Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of SII RoE 1  targets   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 11.0%                                                            | 0%                                                                                    |\n| 11.0%                                                                      | 10%                                                                                   |\n| Between 11.0% and 13.0%                                                    | Pro-rata between 10% and 50% on a straight line basis                                 |\n| 13% and above                                                              | 50%                                                                                   |\n\nAny vesting of the SII RoE 1 element of the LTIP is subject to a SII shareholder cover ratio 1 that meets or exceeds the minimum of the stated working range (in 2020, this was 160% to 180% and remains the target as announced in the Q3 operating update).\n\n## TSR targets for awards made in 2020\n\nRelative TSR performance determines the vesting of the other 50% of the LTIP award. For the 2020 grant, Aviva's TSR performance will be assessed against that of the following companies: Aegon, Allianz, Assicurazioni Generali, AXA, Direct Line Group, Intact, Legal & General, Lloyds Banking Group, M&G, Phoenix, RSA, Standard Life Aberdeen and Zurich Insurance.\n\nThe performance period for the TSR performance condition is the three years beginning 1 January 2020. For the purposes of measuring the TSR performance condition, the Company's TSR and that of the comparator group will be based on the 90-day average TSR for the period immediately preceding the start and end of the performance period. The vesting schedule is set out in the table below.\n\n| TSR position over the three-year performance period   | Percentage of shares in award that vest based on achievement of TSR targets   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Below median                                          | 0%                                                                            |\n| Median                                                | 10%                                                                           |\n| Between median and upper quintile                     | Pro-rata between 10% and 50% on a straight line basis                         |\n| Upper quintile and above                              | 50%                                                                           |\n\n## Payments to past directors (audited information)\n\nGlyn Barker retired from the Board as a NED on 31 December 2019. In 2020 he received a retirement gift with a grossed up value of \u00a35,345.\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited information)\n\nWe announced on 6 July 2020 Maurice Tulloch would step down as Group CEO and retire as a Director of the Company with immediate effect.\n\n- \u221e Maurice was placed on garden leave from 6 July 2020 until the end of his six-month notice period on 5 January 2021. During this period, he continued to receive his contractual salary and benefits. For the period 6 July to 5 January 2021 these totalled \u00a3574,311\n- \u221e The Committee exercised its discretion to treat Maurice as a good leaver under the ABP and LTIP by reason of his retirement\n- -Maurice's 2018, 2019 and 2020 LTIP awards will continue to vest, pro-rated for the time from the date of grant to his leave date and subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions. The two-year holding period will continue to apply\n- -Maurice's outstanding deferred share awards under ABP will continue to vest on the normal vesting dates\n- -All outstanding awards under the ABP and LTIP will remain subject to malus and clawback\n- \u221e Maurice will be required to retain the necessary amount of shares from departure for two years following cessation of employment, in line with the Employment Shareholding Policy and is subject to post-activity restrictions which allow the Committee to reduce or recover awards if certain employment is taken elsewhere\n- \u221e While Maurice remained eligible for a 2020 annual bonus in respect of the period up to and including 5 July 2020, when he left active service with Aviva, the Committee determined, taking all factors into account including Aviva's performance for the first half of 2020, shareholder experience during that period and the wider economic context, that Maurice would not receive a 2020 annual bonus\n- \u221e In line with the Policy, Maurice was entitled to a capped contribution of \u00a310,000 (excluding VAT) towards legal fees incurred in connection with his departure. In addition, assistance with filing tax returns in the UK and Canada with an appropriately qualified tax advisor will be provided to ensure Maurice's and the Company's compliance requirements for trailing income are met. The total value of this benefit is anticipated to be \u00a339,562",

The increase in benefits for EDs reflects relocation and taxable travel and subsistence. The increase in George's fees is a result of his appointment as Chair on 27 May 2020.\n- 2   The increase in fee levels for NEDs are mainly driven by increases in fees effective July 2020, as set out in table 24.\n- 3 Patrick was appointed as Senior Independent Director of Aviva plc and a Remuneration Committee member on 15 June and 7 September 2020 respectively.\n- 4 Mohit and Jim were appointed to the Board 1 December 2020 therefore no comparison available.\n- 5 The increase in benefits for UK based employees has been mainly driven by the increase in the cost of private medical insurance. Without this, benefits would have increased by 2.3%.\n- 6 The reduction in benefits for NEDs compared to 2019 is largely reflective of reduced taxable travel and subsistence costs due to COVID-19.",

Total remuneration reflects all remuneration received by an individual in respect of the relevant years, and includes salary, benefits, pension, and value received from incentive plans.\n\n## Table 17  CEO Pay ratio table\n\n|   Year | Method   | P25 (lower  quartile)   | P50(median)   | P75 (upper  quartile)   |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n|   2020 | Option A | 80:1                    | 56:1          | 34:1                    |\n|   2019 | Option A | 90:1                    | 63:1          | 37:1                    |\n\nWe would highlight the following in terms of the approach taken.\n\n- \u221e In calculating the Group CEO data for 2020, we have aggregated the amount shown in the single figure table of \u00a31,029,794 for Maurice in respect of his services as Group CEO from 1 January to 5 July and the amount shown in the single figure table of \u00a31,204,967 for Amanda in respect of her services from 6 July to 31 December 2020\n- \u221e Similar to prior years, we have provided an additional ratio below, calculated on a full-year basis using total target remuneration due to changes in Group CEO during the year\n- \u221e In 2019, the single figure for Maurice was aggregated with the pro-rata fees for Sir Adrian as Executive Chairman\n- \u221e The P25, P50 and P75 employees were calculated based on full-time equivalent data as at 31 December of the relevant years\n- \u221e Out of the three alternatives available for calculating the ratio, we chose to use Option A as it is considered to be the most accurate way of identifying  employees  at  P25,  P50  and  P75,  and  is  aligned  with  shareholder  expectations.  Under  this  approach  we  calculate  total remuneration on a full-time equivalent basis for all of our UK employees and rank them accordingly\n\nThe decrease in the ratio reflects the fact that:\n\n- \u221e 2020 remuneration outcomes for the Group CEO include a lower aggregate bonus figure than 2019 and nil LTIP vesting, compared to 50% in 2019\n- \u221e Although offset by the role of Group CEO being occupied by an ED for all of 2020, compared with an Executive Chairman and an ED in 2019\n\nWhilst  the  CEO  pay  ratio  has  decreased,  the  salary  and  total  remuneration  for  each  quartile  employee  has  also  remained  broadly  flat (although median salary has increased 2.7% and median total compensation increased 2.3%).\n\nTable 18 provides further information on the total remuneration figure for each quartile employee, and the salary component within this.\n\n| Year   | Pay element        | P25 (lower  quartile)   | P50 (median)   | P75 (upper  quartile)   |\n|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n|        | Salary             | \u00a322,922                 | \u00a332,457        | \u00a351,229                 |\n| 2020   | Total remuneration | \u00a327,677                 | \u00a339,773        | \u00a366,209                 |\n\nIn reviewing the employee pay data, the Committee is comfortable that the P25, P50 and P75 individuals identified appropriately reflect the employee pay profile at those quartiles, and that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees.\n\nAs referred to above, we recognise that 2020 was an unusual year for Aviva resulting in a Group CEO pay ratio which is likely to be lower than we might typically expect. Shareholders may find it helpful to consider what the ratio might have been in a more normal year, recognising that the ratio may well vary significantly from year-to-year. Specifically, we have considered the ratio if Amanda had been employed for the full year 2020 and had received an on-target annual bonus of 100% of salary (half of maximum) and LTIP vesting at 150% of salary (half of maximum).\n\n| Year                                                     | P25 (lower  quartile)   | P50 (median)   | P75 (upper  quartile)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| 2020 (illustrative based on a notional 'target' package) | 135:1                   | 94:1           | 57:1                    |\n\nAt Aviva, we consider that we are equally focused on our colleagues as we are on our customers. We work hard to recognise the individual needs of colleagues and in this context, we are proud of the reward, benefits and overall career packages that we offer our colleagues.\n\n- \u221e In the UK, we have been an accredited Living Wage employer since April 2014\n- \u221e We have a structured salary progression scheme for our frontline colleagues, providing incremental salary increases over the first few years in role as individuals develop and gain experience\n- \u221e We conduct regular market reviews of our salary ranges in order to maintain competitiveness to market rates, and we move everyone who is below a band to at least the minimum of that range each year\n- \u221e We have a comprehensive flexible benefits offering, providing colleagues with the opportunity to select the benefits that matter most to them including equal parental leave\n- \u221e Our competitive pension scheme provides an employer contribution of 14% of salary (subject to the level of employee contribution). Above this level, we share employer National Insurance savings with our colleagues\n- \u221e UK colleagues are eligible to participate in our SAYE and AESOP offerings with similar plans operating for many of our overseas colleagues.

In this manner, the Committee is able to retain oversight of the shares and is comfortable that this provides it with the ability to enforce the post-cessation guidelines in practice\n\n## Table 20  Executive directors - share ownership requirement (audited information)\n\n|                     | Shares held      | Shares held                                           | Shares held                                        |                                                     |                           |                                          |                                       |                  |\n|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Executive Directors | Owned outright 1 | Unvested and   subject to   performance  conditions 2 | Unvested and   subject to  continued  employment 3 | Unvested and   subject to  continued   employment 4 | Vested but  not exercised | Shareholding  requirement  (% of salary) | Current  shareholding 5 (% of salary) | Requirement  met |\n| Amanda Blanc        | 352,226          | 641,921                                               | -                                                  |                                                     |                           | 300                                      | 115%                                  | No               |\n| Jason Windsor       | 495,587          | 663,209                                               | 317,302                                            | 6,338                                               | -                         | 200                                      | 239%                                  | Yes              |\n| Maurice Tulloch     | 625,001          | 2,282,929                                             | 431,698                                            | 6,338                                               | -                         | 300                                      | 208%                                  | No               |\n\nThere were no changes to the EDs interests in Aviva shares during the period 1 January 2021 to 3 March 2021.\n\n|                     | 1 January   2020   | 31 December  2020   |\n|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| George Culmer       | 31,276             | 31,276              |\n| Patricia Cross      | 30,574             | 31,192              |\n| Patrick Flynn       | -                  | -                   |\n| Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda | 10,223             | 19,418              |\n| Mohit Joshi         | -                  | -                   |\n| Jim McConville      | -                  | -                   |\n| Michael Mire        | 50,000             | 50,000              |\n| Former Chair 2      |                    |                     |\n| Sir Adrian Montague | 58,553             | 58,553              |\n| Former NEDs 3       |                    |                     |\n| Amanda Blanc        | -                  | -                   |\n\n- 1 This information includes holdings of any connected persons.\n- 2 Sir Adrian retired from the Board on 31 May 2020.\n\nThere were changes to the NEDs interests in Aviva shares during the period 1 January 2021 to 3 March 2021.

Additionally,  Aviva  Investors  UK  Funds  Services  Ltd  is  subject  to  the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive (AIFMD), the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferrable Securities (UCITS V) directive and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Remuneration Code requirements include an annual disclosure. For AIFMD and UCITS V the disclosure is part of the Financial Statements and/or Annual accounts of the Alternative Investment Funds or UCITS V. For CRD IV requirements the most recent Aviva Investors disclosure can be found in Section 5 of the Pillar 3 Disclosure available at www.aviva.com/pillar3 and a link to the disclosure for the UK Insurance firms can be found at www.aviva.com/remuneration-committee.\n\n## Solvency II remuneration\n\nRemuneration Requirements (PRA PS22/16 & SS10/16) apply to the Aviva Group. Our remuneration structures have been designed in a way so that they are compliant with these requirements for all senior managers across the Group, not just those identified as being specifically covered by the requirements of the regulation. Such employees at Aviva are termed 'Covered Employees'. We are required to complete a Remuneration Policy Statement, which outlines how we have complied with each of the requirements. This document was approved by the Group Remuneration Committee and submitted to the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA).\n\nThe Solvency II  reporting  requirements  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2020  necessitate  firms  to  produce  the  Solvency  and  Financial Condition Report (SFCR) which contains remuneration information and is publicly available. Aviva's reward principles and arrangements are designed  to  incentivise  and  reward  employees  for  achieving  stated  business  goals  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  Company's approach to sound and effective risk management.\n\n## Statement of voting at AGM\n\nThe result of the shareholder vote at the Company's 2020 AGM in respect of the 2019 Directors' Remuneration report is set out in table 23.

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 13 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\nIn addition to forming this opinion, in this report we have also provided information on how we approached the audit, how it has changed from the previous year and details of the significant discussions that we had with the Audit Committee.\n\nCOVID-19 has meant that substantially all of our interactions were undertaken virtually, including those between engagement teams, with our component audit teams and Aviva board members, management and staff.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u221e Our audit scope has been determined to provide coverage of all material financial statement line items.\n- \u221e We have performed audit procedures that have assessed the extent of the impact of COVID-19, in particular on the valuation of insurance contract  liabilities,  the  Group's  ability  to  continue  meeting  regulatory  solvency  capital  requirements,  and  the  Group's  financial performance, as well the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u221e Valuation of life insurance contract liabilities (Group)\n- -Credit default assumptions for illiquid assets, specifically: commercial mortgages and equity release mortgages (Group)\n- -Annuitant mortality assumptions (Group)\n- -Expense assumptions (Group)\n- \u221e Valuation of non-life insurance contract liabilities (Group)\n- \u221e Valuation for hard to value investments (Group)\n- \u221e Risk of error arising from the implementation of new Bulk Purchase Annuities (\"BPA\") actuarial model (Group)\n- \u221e Impact of COVID-19 (Group and Company)",

        "page_content": "Independent auditors' report to the members of Aviva plc continued\n\nStrategic report\n\nGovernance\n\nIFRS financial statements\n\nOther information\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u221e Overall Group materiality: \u00a3157,900,000 (2019: \u00a3158,000,000) based on 5% of three-year average of the Group adjusted operating profit before tax attributable to shareholders' profits.\n- \u221e Overall Company materiality: \u00a361,250,000 (2019: \u00a347,800,000) based on 0.5% of net assets.\n- \u221e Performance materiality: \u00a3118,425,000 (Group) and \u00a345,937,500 (Company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities,  including  fraud,  are  instances  of  non-compliance  with  laws  and  regulations.  We  design  procedures  in  line  with  our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related  to  breaches  of  UK  and  European  regulatory  principles,  such  as  those  governed  by  the  Prudential  Regulation  Authority  and  the Financial Conduct Authority, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We  also  considered  those  laws  and  regulations  that  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  such  as  the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to management bias in accounting estimates and  judgmental  areas  of  the  financial  statements  as  shown  in  our  'Key  Audit  Matters'.  The  Group  engagement  team  shared  this  risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- \u221e Discussions with the Board, management, Internal Audit, senior management involved in the Risk and Compliance functions and Group and Company's legal function, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud.\n- \u221e Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;\n- \u221e Assessment of matters reported on the Group and Company's whistleblowing helpline and fraud register and the results of management's investigation of such matters;\n- \u221e Meeting with the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') periodically and reading key correspondence with the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority, including those in relation to compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u221e Reviewing relevant meeting minutes including those of the Board of Directors, Audit, Remuneration and Disclosure Committees;\n- \u221e Identifying and testing journal entries based on risk criteria;\n- \u221e Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of our testing;\n- \u221e Testing transactions entered into outside of the normal course of the Group and Company's business;\n- \u221e Reviewing the Group's register of litigation and claims, Internal Audit reports, and Compliance reports in so far as they related to noncompliance with laws and regulations and fraud; and\n- \u221e Attendance at Audit and Risk Committee meetings\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nThe risk of error arising from the implementation of new BPA actuarial model and the impact of COVID-19 are new key audit matters this year. Valuation  of  specific  UK  Life  provisions,  which  was  a  key  audit  matter  last  year,  is  no  longer  included  because  of  the  reduction  in  the magnitude and related uncertainty of the provisions held in relation to product governance as a result of the progress made to determine and settle amounts due. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.",

This included consideration of the reasonableness of assumptions  against  actual  historical  experience  and  the appropriateness of any judgements applied;\n- \u221e Tested the key judgements over the preparation of the liabilities, including  manually  calculated  components  focussing  on  the consistency  in  treatment  and  methodology  period-on-period and with reference to recognised actuarial practice;\n- \u221e Used the results of an independent PwC annual benchmarking survey  of  assumptions  to  further  challenge  the  assumption setting process by comparing certain assumptions used relative to the Group's industry peers; and\n- \u221e Assessed the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nAs part of our consideration of the entire set of assumptions, we focused  particularly  on  annuitant  mortality,  credit  default  for illiquid assets and expense assumptions for the UK Life component given  their  significance  to  the  Group's  result  and  the  level  of judgement  involved.  These  aspects  of  our  work  have  been considered in more detail below.\n\n## Annuitant mortality assumptions (Group)\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee report, Accounting policy (L) Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities - Long-term business provisions and note 42 Insurance liabilities methodology and assumptions (b) Long-term business liabilities.\n\nAnnuitant  mortality  assumptions  used  to  value  insurance  contract liabilities  for  UK  Life  require  a  high  degree  of  judgement  due  to  the number  of  factors  which  may  influence  mortality  experience.  The differing factors which affect the assumptions are underlying mortality experience (in the portfolio), industry and management views on the future rate of mortality improvements and external factors arising from developments in the annuity market.\n\nThere  are  two  main  components  to  the  annuitant  mortality assumptions:\n\n- \u221e Mortality base assumption: this component is typically less subjective as it is derived using the external Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) tables for individual annuities and Club Vita 3 (CV3) tables for BPA,  adjusted  for  internal  experience.  However,  judgement  is required  in  choosing  the  appropriate  table  and  fitting  internal experience to this table.\n- \u221e Rate of mortality improvements: this component is more subjective given  the  uncertainty  over  how  life  expectancy  will  change  in  the future and the lack of available data to support judgements made in respect of this\n\nManagement  have  adopted  the  most  recent  CMI  2019  model  and dataset in setting this assumption with specific parameters for the long term rate of improvement and tapering at older ages and adjustments to reflect the profile of their portfolio. This reflects their views on the rate of mortality improvement.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  annuitant  mortality  assumptions we performed the following:\n\n- \u221e Tested  the  methodology  used  by  management  to  derive  the assumptions  with  reference  to  relevant  rules  and  actuarial guidance  and  by  applying  our  industry  knowledge  and experience.  This  included  evaluating  management's  choice  of, and fitting to, the CMI base tables and the adoption of the CMI 2019 model and dataset for improvements and the margin for prudence;\n- \u221e Assessed the results of the experience investigations carried out by management for the annuity business to determine whether they provided support for the assumptions used;\n- \u221e Compared the mortality assumptions selected by management against those used by their peers; and\n- \u221e Considered  alternative  assumptions  that  could  be  used  in  the CMI 2019 model such as the smoothing factor and used externally published information to validate the choice management made.\n\nBased  on  the  work  performed  and  the  evidence  obtained,  we consider  the  assumptions  used  for  annuitant  mortality  to  be appropriate.\n\nIn addition, a margin of prudence is applied to these assumptions.",

A long term deduction for credit  default  is  made  from  the  current  market  yields  and  a supplementary allowance is also held to cover the risk of higher short term default rates along with a margin for prudence.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  credit  default  assumptions,  we  performed  the following:\n\n- \u221e Tested the methodology and credit risk pricing models used by management for commercial and equity release  mortgages  to derive  the  assumptions  with  reference  to  relevant  rules  and actuarial  guidance,  including  the  adoption  of  an  appropriate prudence margin and by applying our industry knowledge and experience; and\n- \u221e Validated  significant  assumptions  used  by  management  by ensuring consistency with the assumptions used for the valuation of the assets, and against market observable data (to the extent available and relevant) and our experience of market practices.\n\nBased  on  the  work  performed  and  the  evidence  obtained,  we consider the assumptions used for credit default risk on commercial mortgages and equity release mortgages to be appropriate .\n\n## Expense assumptions (Group)\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee report, Accounting policy (L) Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities - Long term business provisions and note 42 Insurance liabilities methodology and assumptions (b) Long-term business liabilities.\n\nFuture maintenance expenses and expense inflation assumptions are used in the measurement of life insurance contract liabilities at UK Life. The  assumptions  reflect  the  expected  future  expenses  that  will  be required  to  maintain  the  inforce  policies  at  the  balance  sheet  date, including an allowance for project costs and a margin for prudence. The assumptions used require significant judgement.\n\nIn respect of the expense assumptions, we performed the following:\n\n- \u221e Tested  the  methodology  used  by  management  to  derive  the assumptions  with  reference  to  relevant  rules  and  actuarial guidance  and  by  applying  our  industry  knowledge  and experience. This included testing the split of expenses between acquisition and maintenance by agreeing a sample to supporting evidence; and\n- \u221e We  tested  that  the  assumptions  appropriately  reflect  the expected future expenses for maintaining policies in force at the balance  sheet  date,  which  includes  consideration  of  the allowance for project costs.\n\nBased  on  the  work  performed  and  the  evidence  obtained,  we consider the expense assumptions to be appropriate.\n\n## Valuation of non-life insurance contract liabilities (Group)\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee report, Accounting policy (L) Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities - Long-term business provisions and note 42 Insurance liabilities methodology and assumptions (c) General insurance and health liabilities.\n\nThe  estimation  of  non-life  insurance  contract  liabilities  involves  a significant  degree  of  judgement.  The  liabilities  are  based  on  the estimated  ultimate  cost  of  all  claims  incurred  but  not  settled  at 31 December 2020, whether reported or not, together with the related claims handling costs.\n\nA range of methods, including stochastic projections, may be used to determine these provisions. Underlying these methods are a number of explicit  or  implicit  assumptions  relating  to  the  expected  settlement amount and settlement patterns of claims. This includes assumptions relating to the settlement of personal injury lump sum compensation amounts.\n\nGiven  their  size  in  relation  to  the  consolidated  Group  and  the complexity  of  the  judgements  involved,  our  work  focused  on  the actuarial  liabilities  in  the  UK  General  Insurance,  Canada  General Insurance and France General Insurance components.\n\nWe assessed the calculation of the nonlife insurance liabilities by performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u221e Understood  and  tested  the  governance  process  in  place  to determine the insurance contract liabilities, including testing the associated financial reporting control framework;\n- \u221e Tested  the  underlying  data  to  source  documentation  on  a sample basis;\n- \u221e Using  our  actuarial  specialist  team  members,  applied  our industry  knowledge  and  experience  and  we  compared  the methodology, models and assumptions used against recognised actuarial practices;\n- \u221e Using  our  actuarial  specialist  team  members,  independently estimated  the  reserves  on  selected  classes  of  business, particularly focusing on the largest and most uncertain reserves. For these classes we compared our estimated reserves to those booked  by  management,  and  sought  to  understand  any significant differences;\n- \u221e For  the  remaining  classes  evaluated  the  methodology  and assumptions applied, or performed a diagnostic check to identify and investigate any anomalies; and\n- \u221e Assessed the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nBased on the work performed and evidence obtained, we consider the  methodology  and  assumptions  used  to value the  non-life insurance contract liabilities to be appropriate.",

The risk is not uniform for all investment  types  and  is  greatest  for  the  following,  where  the investments are hard to value because quoted prices are not readily available:\n\n- \u221e Commercial mortgage loans (UK Life);\n- \u221e Equity release mortgage loans (UK Life);\n- \u221e Infrastructure loans (UK Life); and\n- \u221e Structured bond-type investments (France Life).\n\nWe assessed the Directors' approach to valuation of hard to value investments by performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u221e Tested data inputs used in the valuation models to underlying documentation on a sample basis;\n- \u221e Evaluated the methodology and assumptions used by management,  including  yield  curves,  discounted  cash  flows, property  growth  rates,  longevity  and  liquidity  premiums  as relevant to each asset class;\n- \u221e Tested the operation of data integrity and change management controls for the valuation models;\n- \u221e Using our valuation experts, performed independent valuations for a sample of infrastructure loans and structured bonds; and Assessed the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nBased  on  the  work  performed  and  the  evidence  obtained,  we consider the methodology and assumptions used by management to value hard to value assets to be appropriate.\n\n## Risk of error arising from the implementation of new Bulk Purchase Annuities ('BPA') actuarial model (Group)\n\nUK Life have introduced a new model for the valuation of \u00a34.3 billion of Bulk Purchase Annuities during the year.\n\nThe  key  risk  in  relation  to  any  new  model  is  the  risk  of  error  in  the implementation or the functionality of the model. This model is being used to value large BPA schemes written during the year and we have assessed the risk of error in relation to the BPA model to be significant given its complexity and the magnitude of the contracts that it will be used to value.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 (Group and Company)\n\nRefer to the Audit and Risk Committee Reports and note 2 Significant events in the current reporting period.\n\nThe impacts of the global pandemic due to the Coronavirus COVID-19 continue to cause significant social and economic disruption up to the date  of  reporting.  In  our  audit  we  have  identified  the  following  key impacts of COVID-19:\n\n## Ability of the entity to continue as a going concern\n\nThere are a number of potential matters in relation to COVID-19 which could impact on the going concern status of the Group and Company. Using  downside  scenarios  driven  by  the  required  Own  Risk  and Solvency  Assessment  (ORSA)  process,  the  Directors  have  considered the ability of the Company to remain solvent with sufficient liquidity to meet  future  obligations.  The  Directors  have  also  considered  its requirements in respect of regulatory capital under Solvency II and the potential  operational  impacts  on  the  business  arising  from  remote working.\n\nThe Directors' have concluded that the Company is a going concern.\n\n## Impact on Estimation Uncertainty in the Financial Statements\n\nThe pandemic has increased the level of estimation uncertainty in the financial  statements.  The  Directors  have  therefore  considered  how COVID-19 has impacted the key estimates that determine the valuation of  material  balances,  particularly  the  Non  Life  Insurance  Contract Liabilities,  Life  Insurance  Contract  Liabilities  and  Hard  to  Value Financial Investments.\n\nWe assessed the implementation of new BPA actuarial model by performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u221e For  a  sample  of  immediate  bulk  purchase  annuity  policies  we remodelled the gross valuations to within 0.01% on average of management's valuation.\n- \u221e We have replicated the calculation of benefits in deferment on a sample  of  deferred  bulk  purchase  annuity  policies  to  within 0.01% on average.\n- \u221e We  have  reviewed  management's  own  results  reconciliation testing (between this new model and the current model used for other BPA business) and investigated any differences noted by management.\n\nBased on the work performed and evidence obtained, we consider the  valuation  of  the  BPAs  valued  using  the  new  model  to  be appropriate .\n\nIn  assessing  management's  consideration  of  the  impact  of COVID-19  on  the  Company  we  have  performed  the  following procedures:\n\n- \u221e Obtained  management's  updated  going  concern  assessment and challenged the rationale for the downside scenarios adopted and material assumptions made using our knowledge of Aviva's business performance, review of regulatory correspondence and obtaining further corroborating evidence;\n- \u221e Considered information obtained during the course of the audit and  publicly  available  market  information  to  identify  any evidence that would contradict management's assessment of the impact of COVID-19; and\n- \u221e Inquired and understood the actions taken by management to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, including review of Board Risk Committee minutes and attendance of all Audit Committees.\n\nWe  agree  with  the  Director's  conclusions  in  respect  of  going concern.\n\n- \u221e Considered whether there have been any impacts from remote working on the design and operating effectiveness of key controls impacting the preparation of financial statement information;\n- \u221e Challenged management's judgements in the valuation of nonlife  insurance contracts in relation to COVID-19, specifically the treatment of the Business Interruption test case; and\n- \u221e Challenged  the  judgements  applied  by  management  to determine the insurance contract liabilities, including annuitant",

We also performed audit procedures over the head office operations and the consolidation process, as well as over certain other group activities, including specific account balances in the Aviva Employment Services, Aviva Central Services and Aviva Group Holdings components.\n\nWe completed review procedures over the other components not subject to full scope audits.\n\nAs the Group audit team, we determined the level of involvement required at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. In our role as  Group  auditors,  we  exercised  oversight  of  the  work  performed  by  auditors  of  the  components  including  performing  the  following procedures:\n\n- \u221e Issued Group instructions outlining areas requiring additional audit focus, including the key audit matters included above;\n- \u221e Maintained an active dialogue with reporting component audit teams throughout the year;\n- \u221e Attended meetings with local management;\n- \u221e Attended Audit Committee meetings for certain in-scope components;\n- \u221e Reviewed reporting requested from component teams, including those areas determined to be of heightened audit risk; and\n- \u221e Reviewed the detailed working papers, where relevant.\n\nDue to the impact of COVID-19, we were unable to visit component teams in person. Consistent with previous years, we performed a detailed review of key audit working papers at all in-scope components, however this was performed remotely.",

We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.

For  the  year  ended  31  December  2020,  we  have  determined  that  a  3-year  average  of  this  metric  is  more  appropriate  as  it  normalises both economic and non-economic assumption  changes  and  provides  more  consistency  which  aligns  better with the trend in the primary metrics used to assess  the businesses performance and dividend capability such | In  determining  our  materiality,  we  considered  financial  metrics  which  we  believed  to  be  relevant  and  concluded  that  net  assets  was  the  most  appropriate  benchmark.  The  primary  use  of  the  financial  statements  is  to  determine  the  entity's  ability to pay dividends and the users will therefore  be  focussed  on  distributable  reserves,  a  balance  captured using a net asset benchmark. |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u00a320,000,000 and \u00a3145,000,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and  extent  of  our  testing  of  account  balances,  classes  of  transactions  and  disclosures,  for  example  in  determining  sample  sizes.  Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to \u00a3118,425,000 for the Group financial statements and \u00a345,937,500 for the Company financial statements.\n\nIn  determining  the  performance  materiality,  we  considered  a  number  of  factors  -  the  history  of  misstatements,  risk  assessment  and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a37,000,000 (Group audit) (2019:  \u00a37,000,000) and  \u00a33,062,500  (Company  audit) (2019:  \u00a32,390,000) as  well  as  misstatements  below  those  amounts  that,  in  our  view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of  the  directors'  assessment  of  the  Group's  and  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  to  adopt  the  going  concern  basis  of accounting included:\n\n- \u221e Obtained  the  Directors'  Going  Concern  assessment  and  challenged  the  rationale  for  the  downside  scenarios  adopted  and  material assumptions made using our knowledge of Aviva's business performance, review of regulatory correspondence and obtaining further corroborating evidence;\n- \u221e Considered  management's  assessment  of  the  regulatory  Solvency  coverage  and  liquidity  position  in  the  forward  looking  scenarios considered which have been driven from Aviva's ORSA;\n- \u221e Considered information obtained during the course of the audit and publicly available market information to identify any evidence that would contradict management's assessment of going concern (including the impacts of COVID-19); and\n- \u221e Enquired and understood the actions taken by management to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, including review of Board Risk Committee minutes and attendance of all Audit Committees.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation\n\nof the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.",

Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement, included within the Directors' and Corporate Governance Report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u221e The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- \u221e The disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- \u221e The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- \u221e The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- \u221e The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u221e The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u221e The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- \u221e The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the Company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors",

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA  further  description  of  our  responsibilities  for  the  audit  of  the  financial  statements  is  located  on  the  FRC's  website  at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\n- \u221e we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u221e adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u221e certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u221e the  Company  financial  statements  and  the  part  of  the  Directors'  Remuneration  Report  to  be  audited  are  not  in  agreement  with  the accounting records and returns.; or\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 3 May 2012 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 9 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2020.\n\n## Alex Bertolotti (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors London 3 March 2021",

These  policies  have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (A) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial  statements  and  those  of  the  Company have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with  international  accounting  standards  in  conformity  with  the requirements  of  the  Companies  Act  2006  (IFRS)  and  the  legal requirements  of  the  Companies  Act  2006.  In  addition,  the consolidated  financial  statements  also  comply  with  international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No  1606/2002  as  it  applies  in  the  European  Union  (EU).  The consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings,  investment  property,  available-for-sale  financial  assets, and  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (including  derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , the Group has applied existing  accounting  practices  for  insurance  and  participating investment contracts, modified as appropriate to comply with the IFRS framework and applicable standards. Further details are given in accounting policy L.\n\nItems  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each  of  the  Group's entities  are  measured  in  the  currency  of  the  primary  economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are stated in pounds sterling, which  is  the  Company's  functional  and  presentational  currency. Unless  otherwise  noted,  the  amounts  shown  in  these  financial statements are in millions of pounds sterling (\u00a3m).\n\nComparative  figures  have  been  re-presented  for  adjustments  as detailed in note 1.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the Group and/or the Company\n\nThe  Group  and/or  the  Company  has  adopted  the  following amendments to standards which became effective  for  the  annual reporting  period  beginning  on  1  January  2020.  The  amendments have  been  issued  and  endorsed  by  the  EU  and  do  not  have  a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n- (i) Amendments  to  References  to  the  Conceptual  Framework  in  IFRS Standards (published by the IASB in March 2018)\n- (ii) Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations (published by the IASB in October 2018)\n- (iii)  Amendment to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of material (published by the IASB in October 2018)\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group\n\nThe following new standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued, are not yet effective for the Group and have not been adopted early by the Group:\n\n## (i) IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB published IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts ,  a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 that was  issued  in  2005.  IFRS  17  applies  to  all  types  of  insurance contracts  as  well  as  to  certain  financial  instruments  with discretionary participation features. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering  of  previous  local  accounting  policies,  IFRS  17 provides a comprehensive and consistent approach to insurance contracts. The  core  of  IFRS  17  is  the  general  model, supplemented by a specific  adaption  for  contracts  with  direct participation  features  (the  variable  fee  approach)  and  a simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts.\n\nThe main features of the new accounting model for insurance contracts are, as follows: the measurement of the present value of future cash flows incorporating an explicit risk adjustment and remeasured at each reporting period (the fulfilment cash flows); a contractual service margin that is equal and opposite to any day one gain in the fulfilment cash flows of a group of contracts, representing the unearned profit of the insurance contracts to be recognised  in  profit  or  loss  over  the  service  period  (coverage period);  the  presentation  of  insurance  revenue  and  insurance service  expenses  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income based on the concept of insurance services provided during the period; and extensive disclosures to provide information on the recognised  amounts  from  insurance  contracts  and  the  nature and extent of risks arising from these contracts.\n\nOn adoption IFRS 17 will significantly impact the measurement and  presentation  of  the  contracts  in  scope  of  the  standard. Following amendments to the standard published in June 2020, it  is  now  expected  that  the  standard  will  apply  to  annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The final standard remains subject to endorsement. Following departure from the EU and the end of the transition period in December 2020 the Group will be subject to IFRS as endorsed by the UK. The UK endorsement process has commenced and we expect it to complete in time for the 1 January 2023 effective date.\n\n## (ii)  IFRS 9, Financial Instruments\n\nIn September 2016, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that addressed the accounting consequences of the application of  IFRS  9  to  insurers  prior  to implementing IFRS 17. The amendments introduced two options for insurers: the deferral approach and the overlay approach. The deferral approach provides an entity, if eligible, with a temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9. The overlay approach allows an entity  to  remove  from  profit  or  loss  the  effects  of  some  of  the accounting  mismatches  that  may  occur  before  the  new insurance contracts standard is applied. The Group has met the eligibility requirements of the deferral approach as set out below and has opted to apply this deferral from 1 January 2018. The Group  has  however  been  required  to  apply  the  additional disclosure requirements of IFRS 9 which are set out in note 53 and note 59.\n\n- (iv)  Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (published by the IASB in October 2019)",

        "page_content": "Eligibility for the deferral approach was based on an assessment of the Group's liabilities as at 31 December 2015, in accordance with the date specified in the amendments to IFRS 4. At this date the Group's liabilities connected with insurance exceeded 90% of the carrying amount of the Group's total liabilities. The Group's total  liabilities  were  \u00a3369,642 million  and  liabilities  connected with insurance in the statement of financial position at this date primarily  included  insurance  and  participating  investment contracts  within  the  scope  of  IFRS  4  (\u00a3218,604  million),  nonparticipating  investment  contract  liabilities  (\u00a3103,125  million), unallocated divisible surplus (\u00a38,811 million), borrowings (\u00a38,770 million),  and  certain  amounts  within  payables  and  other financial liabilities which arise in the course of writing insurance business (\u00a310,285 million).\n\nIn December 2020, the EU endorsed the IASB's Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts - deferral of IFRS 9 .  This extends the fixed expiry date for the temporary exemption for insurers from applying IFRS 9 from 1 January 2021 until 1 January 2023, to align the effective dates of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with  IFRS 17 Insurance contracts .\n\nThe impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group's consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the interaction with the new insurance contracts standard, IFRS 17. As such, it is not possible to fully assess the effect of the adoption of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 has been endorsed by the EU.\n\nIFRS  9  incorporates  new  classification  and  measurement requirements  for  financial  assets,  the  introduction  of  an expected credit  loss  impairment  model  which  will  replace  the incurred  loss  model  of  IAS  39,  and  new  hedge  accounting requirements. Under IFRS 9, all financial assets will be measured at either amortised cost or fair value. The basis of classification will depend on the business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The standard retains most of IAS 39's requirements for financial liabilities except for those designated at fair value through profit or loss whereby that part of  the  fair  value  changes  attributable  to  own  credit  is  to  be recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  instead  of  the income  statement.  The  hedge  accounting  requirements  are more closely aligned with risk management practices and follow a more principle based approach.\n\nThe Company is not eligible to apply the deferral approach and has  adopted  IFRS  9  from  1  January  2018.  IFRS  9  information relating  to  entities  within  the  Group  which  have  applied  IFRS from  1  January  2018  can  be  found  in  the  entities'  publicly available individual financial statements.\n\nThe following new standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued, are not effective for the current reporting period and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements:\n\n## (iii)  Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: COVID-19 related rent concessions\n\nPublished  by  the  IASB  in  May  2020.  The  amendments  are effective for annual reporting beginning on or after 30 June 2020 and have been endorsed by the EU.\n\n## (iv)  Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16\n\nPublished  by  the  IASB  in  August  2020.  The  amendments  are effective  for  annual  reporting  beginning  on  or  after  1  January 2021 and have not yet been endorsed by the EU.\n\n## (B) Group adjusted operating profit\n\nThe long-term nature of much of the Group's operations means that, for management's  decision-making  and  internal  performance management  of  our  operating  segments,  the  Group  focuses  on Group adjusted operating profit, a non-GAAP alternative performance measure (APM) which is not bound by IFRS. The APM incorporates the expected return on investments which supports its long-term and non-long-term businesses.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for long-term business is based on expected  investment  returns  on  financial  investments  backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities. Variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact  of  changes  in  economic  assumptions  on  liabilities,  are disclosed  separately  outside  Group  adjusted  operating  profit.  For non-long-term  business,  the  total  investment  income,  including realised and unrealised gains, is analysed between that calculated using  a  longer-term  return  and  short-term  fluctuations  from  that level. The exclusion of short-term realised and unrealised investment gains  and  losses  from  the  Group  adjusted  operating  profit  APM reflects the long-term nature of much of our business and presents separately the operating profit APM which is used in managing the performance  of  our  operating  segments  from  the  impact  of economic  factors.  Further  details  of  this  analysis  and  the assumptions used are given in notes 9 and 10.\n\nGroup adjusted  operating  profit  excludes  impairment  of  goodwill, associates  and  joint  ventures;  amortisation  and  impairment  of intangibles  acquired  in  business  combinations;  amortisation  and impairment of acquired value of in-force business; and the profit or loss on disposal and remeasurement of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. These items principally relate to mergers, acquisition and disposal activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from the operating profit APM as this is principally used to  manage  the  performance  of  our  operating  segments  when reporting to the Group's chief operating decision maker.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit also excludes other items, which are those items that, in the Directors' view, are required to be separately disclosed  by  virtue  of  their  nature  or  incidence  to  enable  a  full understanding of the Group's financial performance. Details of these items, including an explanation of the rationale for their exclusion, are provided in the Alternative Performance Measures section within 'Other information'.\n\nThe  Group  adjusted  operating  profit  APM  should  be  viewed  as complementary  to  IFRS  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles (GAAP)  measures.  It  is  important  to  consider  Group  adjusted operating profit and profit for the year together to understand the performance of the business in the period.\n\n## (C) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates\n\n## Critical accounting policies\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements and assumptions  applied  and  the  appropriateness  of  significant accounting  policies.  The  significant  issues  considered  by  the Committee  in  the  year  are  included  within  the  Audit  Committee report.\n\nThe  following  accounting  policies  are  those  that  have  the  most significant  impact  on  the  amounts  recognised  in  the  financial statements, with those judgements involving estimation summarised thereafter.",

Actual  results  may  differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.\n\nThe  table  below  sets  out  those  items  considered  particularly susceptible to changes in estimates and assumptions, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, and the relevant accounting policy and note disclosures.\n\n| Item                                                                            | Critical accounting estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Accounting  policy   | Note   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------|\n| Measurement of  insurance and  participating  investment  contract  liabilities | Principal assumptions used in the  calculation of life insurance and  participating investment contract  liabilities include those in respect of  annuitant mortality, expenses,  valuation interest rates and credit  default allowances on corporate                                                                                                                                        | L                    | 44(a)  |\n|                                                                                 | bonds and other non-sovereign credit  assets.

The valuation of the provisions has decreased significantly in the year, primarily due to utilisation of one of the provisions, resulting in significantly reduced estimation uncertainty in aggregate as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## (D) Consolidation principles\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an investee, if and only if, the Group has all of the following:\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\n- \u221e power over the investee;\n- \u221e exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- \u221e the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.\n\nThe  Group  considers  all  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  in assessing  whether  it  has  power  over  an  investee,  including  the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities,  substantive and protective rights, voting rights and potential voting rights.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\n## Investment vehicles\n\nIn  several  countries,  the  Group  has  invested  in  a  number  of specialised  investment  vehicles  such  as  Open-ended  Investment Companies (OEICs) and unit trusts. These invest mainly in equities, bonds,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  properties,  and  distribute most  of  their  income.  In  determining  whether  the  Group  controls such vehicles, primary considerations include whether the Group is acting  as  a  principal  or  an  agent  (including  an  assessment  of  the substantive removal rights of third parties) and the variability in the returns associated with the Group's aggregate economic interest in the fund (direct interest and expected management fees) relative to the total variability of returns.\n\nAdditionally, the Group's percentage ownership in these vehicles can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the level of participation of the Group and third-parties. To avoid transitory or minor changes in fund holdings (which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the  Group's  involvement)  resulting  in  binary  changes  in  the consolidation conclusions, the Group takes into account the trend of ownership over a period of time. This is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u221e Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 40%, the Group is judged to have control over the entity;",

        "page_content": "Accounting policies continued\n\n- \u221e Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 40%, the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  Group's  involvement  in  the entity are considered, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity. Considerations include the rights held by other parties, the Group's rights to fees from the entity, the variability  in  the  returns  associated  with  the  Group's  aggregate economic  interest  in  the  fund  and  the  nature  of  the  Group's exposure to variability compared with that of other investors; and\n- \u221e Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity.\n\nWhere  the  Group  is  deemed  to  control  such  vehicles,  they  are consolidated,  with  the  interests  of  parties  other  than  Aviva  being classified as liabilities. These appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unitholders' in the consolidated statement of financial position. The interest of parties other than Aviva in the investment return on these funds appear as 'Investment expense/(income) attributable to unitholders' in the income statement.\n\nWhere  the  Group  does  not  control  such  vehicles,  and  these investments are held by its insurance or investment funds, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in  the  consolidated  statement of financial position, in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement .\n\nAs part of their investment strategy, long-term business policyholder funds  have  invested  in  a  number  of  property  limited  partnerships (PLPs), either directly or via property unit trusts (PUTs), through a mix of  capital  and  loans.  The  PLPs  are  managed  by  general  partners (GPs), in which the long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs. The PUTs are managed by a Group subsidiary.\n\nAccounting  for  the  PUTs  and  PLPs  as  subsidiaries,  joint  ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on whether the Group is deemed to have control or joint control over the PUTs and PLPs' shareholdings in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement are considered along with other factors that determine control,  as  outlined  above.  Where  the  Group  exerts  control  over  a PUT or a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and  liabilities  have  been  consolidated.  Where  the  partnership  is managed by an agreement such that there is joint control between the  parties,  notwithstanding  that  the  Group's  partnership  share  in the PLP (including its indirect stake via the relevant PUT and GP) may be  lower  or  higher  than  50%,  such  PUTs  and  PLPs  have  been classified  as  joint  ventures  (see  below).  Where  the  Group  has significant influence over the PUT or PLP, as defined in the following section, the PUT or PLP is classified as an associate. Where the Group holds non-controlling interests in PLPs, with no significant influence or  control  over  their  associated  GPs,  the  relevant  investments  are carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  within  financial investments.\n\n## Consolidation procedure\n\nSubsidiaries  are  consolidated  from  the  date  the  Group  obtains control and are excluded from consolidation from the date the Group loses control. All intercompany  transactions, balances and unrealised  surpluses  and  deficits  on  transactions  between  Group companies have been eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with Group policies.\n\nThe Group is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under this method, the Group recognises identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination,  the  Group  has  the  option  to  measure  the  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  acquiree  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net  assets  of  the  subsidiary  acquired  is  recorded  as  goodwill  (see accounting policy O below). Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that lead to changes in the ownership interests in a subsidiary but do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions.\n\n## Merger accounting and the merger reserve\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, the date of first time adoption of IFRS, certain significant  business  combinations  were  accounted  for  using  the 'pooling of interests method' (or merger accounting), which treats the  merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current  and  comparative  accounting  periods.  Merger  accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated  statement  of  financial  position,  being  the  difference between  the  nominal  value  of  new  shares  issued  by  the  Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiary's own share capital and share premium account. These transactions  have  not  been  restated,  as  permitted  by  the  IFRS  1 transitional arrangements.\n\nThe merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of  new  shares  by  the  Company,  thereby  attracting  merger  relief under  the  Companies  Act  1985  and,  from  1  October  2009,  the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates  are  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  significant influence.  Significant  influence  is  the  power  to  participate  in  the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control. Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it has between 20% and 50% of voting rights. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Group and other parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net  assets  of  the  joint  venture.  Joint  control  is  the  contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a number of these, the Group's share of  the  underlying assets and liabilities may be greater or less than 50%  but  the  terms  of  the  relevant  agreements  make  it  clear  that control is not exercised. Such jointly controlled entities are referred to as joint ventures in these financial statements.\n\nGains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. Losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction  provides  evidence  of  an  impairment  of  the  asset transferred between entities.\n\nOther than investments in investment vehicles which are carried at fair value through profit or loss, investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the cost of the investment in a given associate or joint venture, together with the Group's share of that entity's postacquisition changes to shareholders' funds, is included as an asset in the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position.  As  explained  in accounting  policy  O,  the  cost  includes  goodwill  recognised  on acquisition.  The  Group's  share  of  their  post-acquisition  profit  or losses is recognised in the income statement and its share of postacquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group no longer has significant influence or joint control over the investment.\n\nIf the Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or  exceeds  its  interest  in  the  undertaking,  the  Group  does  not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity.",

        "page_content": "## The Company's investments\n\nIn  the  Company's  statement  of  financial  position,  subsidiaries, associates  and  joint  ventures  are  stated  at  cost  less  impairment. Investments are reviewed annually to test whether any indicators of impairment exist. Where there is objective evidence of such an asset being impaired the investment is impaired to its recoverable value and any unrealised loss is recorded in the income statement.\n\n## (E) Foreign currency translation\n\nIncome statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Group's presentation currency at average exchange rates for the year while their statements of financial position are translated at the year-end exchange rates. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and  joint  ventures,  and  of  borrowings  and  other  currency instruments  designated  as  hedges  of  such  investments,  are recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  taken  to  the currency translation reserve within equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, such exchange differences are transferred out of this reserve and are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. The cumulative translation differences were deemed to be zero at the transition date to IFRS.\n\nForeign  currency  transactions  are  accounted  for  at  the  exchange rates  prevailing  at  the  date  of  the  transactions.  Gains  and  losses resulting  from  the  settlement  of  such  transactions,  and  from  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nTranslation  differences  on  debt  securities  and  other  monetary financial assets measured at fair value and designated as held at fair value  through  profit  or  loss  (FVTPL)  (see  accounting  policy  T)  are included  in  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  in  the  income statement. For monetary financial assets designated as available for sale  (AFS),  translation  differences  are  calculated  as  if  they  were carried  at  amortised  cost  and  so  are  recognised  in  the  income statement, while foreign exchange differences arising from fair value gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and included  in  the  investment  valuation  reserve  within  equity. Translation  differences  on  non-monetary  items,  such  as  equities which are designated as FVTPL, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss, whereas such differences on AFS equities are included in the investment valuation reserve.\n\n## (F) Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market participants  at  the  measurement  date,  regardless  of  whether  that price  is  directly  observable  or  estimated  using  another  valuation technique.  This  presumes  that  the  transaction  takes  place  in  the principal  (or  most  advantageous)  market  under  current  market conditions. Fair value is a market-based measure and in the absence of observable market prices in an active market, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  a  non-financial  asset  is  determined  based  on  its highest and best use from a market participant's perspective. When using this  approach,  the  Group  takes  into  account  the  asset's  use that  is  physically  possible,  legally  permissible  and  financially feasible.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e. the fair value of the consideration  given  or  received.  In  certain  circumstances,  the  fair value at initial recognition may differ from the transaction price.\n\nIf  the  fair  value  is  evidenced by comparison with other observable current  market  transactions  in  the  same  instrument  (i.e.  without modification or repackaging), or is based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, then the difference  between  the  fair  value  at  initial  recognition  and  the transaction  price  is  recognised  as  a  gain  or  loss  in  the  income statement. When unobservable market data has a significant impact on the valuation of financial instruments, the difference between the fair  value  at  initial  recognition  and  the  transaction  price  is  not recognised immediately in the income statement, but deferred and recognised in the income statement on an appropriate basis over the life  of  the  instrument  but  no  later  than  when  the  valuation  is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out or otherwise matured.\n\nIf an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask  price,  the  price  within  the  bid-ask  spread  that  is  most representative of fair value in the circumstances is used to measure fair value.\n\n## (G) Product classification\n\nInsurance  contracts  are  defined  as  those  containing  significant insurance risk if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, excluding scenarios  that  lack  commercial  substance,  at  the  inception  of  the contract. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and  obligations  are  extinguished  or  expire.  Contracts  can  be reclassified  as  insurance  contracts  after  inception  if  insurance  risk becomes significant. Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts. Some insurance  and  investment  contracts  contain  a  discretionary participation  feature,  which  is  a  contractual  right  to  receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits. These are referred to as participating contracts.\n\nAs noted  in  accounting  policy  A,  insurance  contracts  and participating  investment  contracts  in  general  continue  to  be measured and accounted for under existing accounting practices at the later of the date of transition to IFRS ('grandfathered') or the date of  the  acquisition  of  the  entity,  in  accordance  with  IFRS  4.  IFRS accounting for insurance contracts in UK  companies  was grandfathered at the date of transition to IFRS and determined in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers (subsequently withdrawn by the ABI in 2015).\n\nIn certain  businesses,  the  accounting  policies  or  accounting estimates  have  been  changed,  as  permitted  by  IFRS  4  and  IAS  8 respectively, to remeasure designated insurance liabilities to reflect current  market  interest  rates  and  changes  to  regulatory  capital requirements.  When  accounting  policies  or  accounting  estimates have  been  changed,  and  adjustments  to  the  measurement  basis have  occurred,  the  financial  statements  of  that  year  will  have disclosed  the  impacts  accordingly.  One  such  example  is  our adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 27 Life Assurance (FRS 27) which was issued by the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in December 2004 (subsequently withdrawn by the ASB in 2015).\n\n## (H) Premiums earned\n\nPremiums  on  long-term  insurance  contracts  and  participating investment  contracts  are  recognised  as  income  when  receivable, except  for  investment-linked  premiums  which  are  accounted  for when  the  corresponding  liabilities  are  recognised.  For  single premium business, this is the date from which the policy is effective. For  regular  premium  contracts,  receivables  are  recognised  at  the date when payments are due. Premiums are shown before deduction of commission and before any sales-based taxes or duties.",

        "page_content": "Accounting policies continued\n\nWhere policies lapse due to non-receipt of premiums, then all the related  premium  income  accrued  but  not  received  from  the  date they are deemed to have lapsed is offset against premiums.\n\nGeneral  insurance  and  health  premiums  written  reflect  business incepted  during  the  year,  and  exclude  any  sales-based  taxes  or duties. Unearned premiums are those proportions of the premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the statement of financial position date. Unearned premiums are calculated on either a daily or monthly  pro  rata  basis.  Premiums  collected  by intermediaries,  but  not  yet  received,  are  assessed  based  on estimates from underwriting or past experience, and are included in premiums written.\n\nDeposits collected under investment contracts without a discretionary participation feature (non-participating contracts) are not accounted for through the income statement, except for the fee income (covered in accounting policy I) and the investment income attributable  to  those  contracts,  but  are  accounted  for  directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the investment contract liability.\n\n## (I) Other investment contract fee revenue\n\nInvestment  contract  policyholders  are  charged  fees  for  policy administration,  investment  management,  surrenders  or  other contract services. The fees may be for fixed amounts or vary with the amounts  being  managed,  and  will  generally  be  charged  as  an adjustment to the policyholder's balance. Fees related to investment management  services  are  recognised  as  revenue  over  time,  as performance obligations are satisfied. In most cases this revenue is recognised in the same period in which the fees are charged to the policyholder. Fees that are related to services to be provided in future periods  are  deferred  and  recognised  when  the  performance obligation is  fulfilled.  Variable  consideration,  such  as  performance fees  and  commission  subject  to  clawback  arrangements,  is  not recognised as revenue until it is reasonably certain that no significant reversal of amounts recognised would occur.\n\nInitiation and other 'front-end' fees (fees that are assessed against the  policyholder  balance  as  consideration  for  origination  of  the contract)  are  charged  on  some  non-participating  investment  and investment fund management contracts. For investment contracts measured at fair value, the front-end fees that relate to the provision of investment management services are deferred and recognised as the services are provided. Origination fees are recognised immediately where the sale of fund interests represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## (J) Other fee and commission income\n\nOther  fee  and  commission  income  consists  primarily  of  fund management fees, distribution fees from mutual funds, commissions on reinsurance ceded, commission revenue from the sale of mutual fund shares  and  transfer  agent  fees  for  shareholder  record  keeping. Reinsurance commissions receivable are deferred in the same way as acquisition costs, as described in accounting policy X. All other fee and commission income is recognised over time as the services are provided.\n\n## (K) Net investment income\n\nInvestment  income  consists  of  dividends,  interest  and  rents receivable  for  the  year,  movements  in  amortised  cost  on  debt securities, realised gains and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on FVTPL investments (as defined in accounting policy T). Dividends on equity securities are recorded as revenue on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective  yield  on  the  investment.  It  includes  the  interest  rate differential on forward foreign exchange contracts. Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis, and is recognised on a straight line basis unless there is compelling evidence that benefits do not accrue evenly over the period of the lease.\n\nA gain or loss on a financial investment is only realised on disposal or transfer, and is the difference between the proceeds received, net of transaction  costs,  and  its  original  cost  or  amortised  cost,  as appropriate.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses, arising on investments which have not been derecognised as a result of disposal or transfer, represent the difference  between  the  carrying  value  at  the  year  end  and  the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the year. Realised gains or losses on investment property represent the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the property.\n\n## (L) Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities Claims\n\nLong-term business claims reflect the cost of all claims arising during the  year,  including  claims  handling  costs,  as  well  as  policyholder bonuses accrued in anticipation of bonus declarations.\n\nGeneral  insurance  and  health  claims  incurred  include  all  losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, related handling costs, a reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries, and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.\n\nClaims handling costs include internal and external costs incurred in connection with the negotiation and settlement of claims. Internal costs include all direct expenses of the claims department and any part of the general administrative costs directly attributable to the claims function.\n\n## Long-term business provisions\n\nUnder  current  IFRS  requirements,  insurance  and  participating investment  contract  liabilities  are  measured  using  accounting policies  consistent  with  those  adopted  previously  under  existing accounting practices, with the exception of liabilities remeasured to reflect current market interest rates to be consistent with the value of the backing assets, and those relating to UK with-profits and nonprofit contracts.\n\nThe long-term business provisions are calculated separately for each life  operation,  based  either  on  local  regulatory  requirements  or existing local GAAP (at the later of the date of transition to IFRS or the date  of  the  acquisition  of  the  entity);  and  actuarial  principles consistent with those applied in each local market. Each calculation represents  a  determination  within  a  range  of  possible  outcomes, where  the  assumptions  used  in  the  calculations  depend  on  the circumstances  prevailing  in  each  life  operation.  The  principal assumptions  are  disclosed  in  note  42(a).  For  the  UK  with-profits funds,  FRS  27  required  liabilities  to  be  calculated  on  the  realistic basis adjusted to remove the shareholders' share of future bonuses. FRS 27 was grandfathered from UK regulatory requirements prior to the adoption of Solvency II. For UK non-profit insurance contracts, the  liabilities  are  calculated  using  the  gross  premium  valuation method.  This  method  uses  the  amount  of  contractual  premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates,  mortality  and  morbidity,  persistency  and  future  expenses. These assumptions are set on a prudent basis, can vary by contract type  and  reflect  current  and  expected  future  experience.  These estimates depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change. The liabilities are based on the UK regulatory requirements prior to the adoption of Solvency II, adjusted  to  remove  certain  regulatory  reserves  and  margins  in assumptions, notably for annuity business.",

Any  excess  of  this difference over the recoverable amount is charged to net income in the reporting period.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nEmbedded  derivatives  that  meet  the  definition  of  an  insurance contract or correspond to options to surrender insurance contracts for a set amount (or based on a fixed amount and an interest rate) are  not  separately  measured.  All  other  embedded  derivatives  are separated  and  measured  at  fair  value  if  they  are  not  considered closely  related  to  the  host  insurance  contract  or  do  not  meet  the definition of an insurance contract. Fair value reflects own credit risk to the extent the embedded derivative is not fully collateralised.\n\n## Liability adequacy\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  an  assessment  is  made  of  whether  the recognised  long-term  business  provisions  are  adequate,  using current estimates of future cash flows. If that assessment shows that the  carrying  amount  of  the  liabilities  (less  related  assets)  is insufficient in light of the estimated future cash flows, the deficiency is  recognised in the income statement by setting up an additional liability in the statement of financial position.\n\n## General insurance and health provisions Outstanding claims provisions\n\nGeneral  insurance  and  health  outstanding  claims  provisions  are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the statement of financial position date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs. Significant delays are experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, particularly in respect of liability business, including environmental and pollution exposures, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date. As such, booked claim provisions for general insurance and health insurance are based on the best estimate of the cost of future  claim  payments  plus  an  explicit  allowance  for  risk  and uncertainty. Any estimate represents a determination within a range of possible outcomes. Further details of estimation techniques are given in note 43(b).\n\nProvisions for latent claims and claims that are settled on an annuity type  basis  such  as  structured  settlements  are  discounted,  in  the relevant  currency  at  the  reporting  date,  having  regard  to  the expected  settlement  dates  of  the  claims  and  the  nature  of  the liabilities. The range of discount rates used is described in note 43(b). Outstanding  claims  provisions  are  valued  net  of  an  allowance  for expected future recoveries. Recoveries include non-insurance assets that  have  been  acquired  by  exercising  rights  to  salvage  and subrogation under the terms of insurance contracts.\n\nIn  prior  periods, the accounting policy was to disclose anticipated recoveries  as  receivables  where  material,  otherwise  they  were deducted  from  outstanding  claims  provisions.  To  remove  the potential for inconsistent presentation of these balances in different reporting  periods,  the  accounting  policy  has  been  changed  to present outstanding claims provisions net of anticipated recoveries.\n\nThe revised  accounting  policy  is  consistent  with  previous  practice and so there is no restatement of 2019 comparatives in the statement of financial position or related notes.\n\n## Provision for unearned premiums\n\nThe proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as a provision  for  unearned  premiums.  The  change  in  this  provision  is taken to the income statement as recognition of revenue over the period of risk.\n\n## Liability adequacy\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  reviews  its  unexpired  risks  and carries out a liability adequacy test for any overall excess of expected claims  and  deferred  acquisition  costs  over  unearned  premiums, using the current estimates of future cash flows under its contracts after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on assets relating to the relevant general business provisions.\n\nIf  these  estimates  show  that  the  carrying  amount  of  its  insurance liabilities  (less  related  deferred  acquisition  costs)  is  insufficient  in light of the estimated future cash flows, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up an additional liability in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Other assessments and levies\n\nThe  Group  is  subject  to  various  periodic  insurance-related assessments  or  guarantee  fund  levies.  Related  provisions  are established where there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as  a  result  of  a  past  event.  Such  amounts  are  not  included  in insurance  liabilities  but  are  included  under  'Pension  deficits  and other provisions' in the statement of financial position.\n\n## (M) Non-participating investment contract liabilities Claims\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts with an account balance, claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nDeposits collected under non-participating investment contracts are not  accounted  for  through  the  income  statement,  except  for  the investment  income  attributable  to  those  contracts,  but  are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the investment contract liability.\n\nThe majority of the Group's contracts classified as non-participating investment contracts are unit-linked contracts and are measured at fair value.\n\nThe liability's fair value is determined using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate of the amount for which the liability could be transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants at  the  measurement  date,  subject  to  a  minimum  equal  to  the surrender value. For unit-linked contracts, the fair  value  liability  is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units. In addition,  if  required,  non-unit  reserves  are  held  based  on  a discounted  cash  flow  analysis.  For  non-linked  contracts,  the  fair value  liability  is  based  on  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis,  with allowance for risk calibrated to match the market price for risk.\n\n## (N) Reinsurance\n\nThe Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of business. Premiums on  reinsurance  assumed  are  recognised  as  revenue  in  the  same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business,  taking  into  account  the  product  classification  of  the reinsured business.",

        "page_content": "The  cost  of  reinsurance  related  to  long-duration  contracts  is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies, using assumptions consistent with those used to account for these policies.\n\nWhere general insurance liabilities are discounted, any corresponding  reinsurance  assets  are  also  discounted  using consistent assumptions.\n\nGains or losses on buying retroactive reinsurance are recognised in the income statement immediately at the date of purchase and are not  amortised.  Premiums  ceded  and  claims  reimbursed  are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position as appropriate.\n\nReinsurance  assets  primarily  include  balances  due  from  both insurance  and  reinsurance  companies  for  ceded  insurance  and investment contract liabilities. This includes balances in respect of investment contracts which are legally reinsurance contracts but do not  meet  the  definition  of  a  reinsurance  contract  under  IFRS. Amounts  recoverable  from  reinsurers  are  estimated  in  a  manner consistent  with  the  underlying  contract  liabilities,  outstanding claims  provisions  or  settled  claims  associated  with  the  reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract.\n\nReinsurance of non-participating investment contracts and reinsurance  contracts  that  principally  transfer  financial  risk  are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position. A deposit asset or liability is recognised, based on the consideration paid or received less any explicitly identified premiums or fees to be retained  by  the  reinsured.  These  deposit  assets  or  liabilities  are shown within reinsurance assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nIf  a  reinsurance  asset  is  impaired,  the  Group  reduces  the  carrying amount  accordingly  and  recognises  that  impairment  loss  in  the income  statement.  A  reinsurance  asset  is  impaired  if  there  is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.\n\n## (O) Goodwill, AVIF and intangible assets Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair  value  of  the  Group's  share  of  the  net  assets  of  the  acquired subsidiary,  associate  or  joint  venture  at  the  date  of  acquisition. Goodwill arising on the Group's investments in subsidiaries is shown as  a  separate  asset,  while  that  on  associates  and  joint  ventures  is included within the carrying value of those investments.\n\nGoodwill  on  acquisitions  prior  to  1  January  2004  (the  date  of transition  to  IFRS)  is  carried  at  its  book  value  (original  cost  less cumulative  amortisation)  on  that  date,  less  any  impairment subsequently incurred. Goodwill arising before 1 January 1998 was eliminated against reserves and has not been reinstated.\n\nWhere negative goodwill arises on an acquisition, this is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Acquired value of in-force business (AVIF)\n\nThe  present  value  of  future  profits  on  a  portfolio  of  long-term insurance  and  investment  contracts,  acquired  either  directly  or through the purchase of a subsidiary, is recognised as an asset.\n\nIf  the  AVIF  results  from  the  acquisition  of  an  investment  in  a  joint venture or an associate, it is held within the carrying amount of that investment. In all cases, the AVIF is amortised over the useful lifetime of the related contracts in the portfolio on a systematic basis. The rate  of  amortisation  is  chosen  by  considering  the  profile  of  the additional  value  of  in-force  business  acquired  and  the  expected depletion in its value.\n\nNon-participating investment contract AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment, consistent with reviews conducted for other finite life intangible assets.  Insurance and participating investment contract AVIF is reviewed for impairment at each reporting date as part of the liability adequacy requirements of IFRS 4 (see accounting policy L). AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment and impairment tested at product portfolio level by reference to a projection of future profits arising from the portfolio.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets consist primarily of contractual relationships such as access to distribution networks, customer lists and software. The economic  lives  of  these  are  determined  by  considering  relevant factors  such  as  usage  of  the  asset,  typical  product  life  cycles, potential  obsolescence,  maintenance  costs,  the  stability  of  the industry,  competitive  position  and  the  period  of  control  over  the assets.  Finite  life  intangibles  are  amortised  over  their  useful  lives, which range from three to 30 years, using the straight-line method.\n\nThe  amortisation  charge  for  the  year  is  included  in  the  income statement under 'Other expenses'. For intangibles with finite lives, impairment  charges  will  be  recognised  in  the  income  statement where evidence of such impairment is observed.\n\nIntangibles  with  indefinite  lives  are  subject  to  regular  impairment testing, as described below.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nFor  impairment  testing,  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with indefinite useful lives have been allocated to cash-generating units. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value. Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are written down for impairment where the recoverable amount is insufficient to support its carrying value. Further  details  on  goodwill  allocation  and  impairment  testing  are given in note 17. Any impairments are charged as expenses in the income statement.\n\n## (P) Property and equipment\n\nOwner-occupied properties are carried at  their  revalued  amounts, and movements are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to a separate reserve within equity. When such properties are sold, the accumulated revaluation surpluses are transferred from this reserve to retained earnings. These properties are depreciated down to their estimated residual values over their useful lives.\n\nThis excludes owner-occupied  properties  held  under  lease arrangements, which are measured at amortised cost, as described in accounting policy Z.\n\nAll  other  items  classed  as  property  and  equipment  within  the statement  of  financial  position  are  carried  at  historical  cost  less accumulated depreciation.\n\nInvestment  properties  under  construction  are  included  within property and equipment until completion, and are stated at cost less any  provision  for  impairment  in  their  values  until  construction  is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the cost  of  other  assets  to  their  residual  values  over  their  estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u221e Properties under construction\n\nNo depreciation 25 years\n\n- \u221e Owner-occupied properties, and related mechanical and electrical equipment\n- \u221e Motor vehicles\n\nThree  years,  or  lease  term  (up to useful life) if longer\n\n- \u221e Computer equipment\n\nThree to five years\n\n- \u221e Other assets\n\nThree to five years",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nThe assets' residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are  reviewed  regularly,  at  least  at  each  financial  year  end,  and adjusted  if  appropriate.  Where  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  is greater  than  its  estimated  recoverable  amount,  it  is  written  down immediately to its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of  property  and  equipment  are  determined  by  reference  to  their carrying amount.\n\nBorrowing  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  and construction of property and equipment are capitalised. All repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the  financial  period  in  which  they  are  incurred.  The  cost  of  major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the most recently assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the  Group  and  the  renovation  replaces  an  identifiable  part  of  the asset. Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n\n## (Q) Investment property\n\nInvestment  property  is  held  for  long-term  rental  yields  and  is  not occupied by the Group. Completed investment property is stated at its fair value, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by qualified staff of the Group. Changes in fair values are recorded in the income statement in net investment income.\n\nAs  described  in  accounting  policy  P  above,  investment  properties under  construction  are  included  within  property  and  equipment, and  are  stated  at  cost  less  any  impairment  in  their  values  until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\n## (R) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nProperty and equipment and other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  An impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement  for  the amount  by  which  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs  of  disposal  and  value  in  use.  For  the  purposes  of  assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are  separately  identifiable  cash  flows.  Non-financial  assets,  except goodwill which have suffered an impairment, are reviewed annually for possible reversal of the impairment.\n\n## (S) Derecognition and offset of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:\n\n- \u221e The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;\n- \u221e The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has  assumed an obligation  to  pay  them  in  full  without  material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; or\n- \u221e The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset  and  has  either  transferred  substantially  all  the  risks  and rewards  of  the  asset,  or  has  neither  transferred  nor  retained substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  asset,  but  has transferred control of the asset.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in  the  statement  of  financial  position  when  there  is  a  currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is the ability and intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (T) Financial investments\n\nThe Group classifies its investments as either FVTPL or AFS.\n\nThe classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were  acquired,  and  is  determined  by  local  management  at  initial recognition. The FVTPL category has two subcategories - those that meet the definition as being held for trading and those the Group chooses to designate as FVTPL (referred to in this accounting policy as 'other than trading') upon initial recognition.\n\nIn general, the other than trading category is used as, in most cases, the Group's investment or risk management strategy is to manage its financial investments on a fair value basis. Debt securities and equity securities, which the Group acquires with the intention to resell in the short  term,  are  classified  as  trading,  as  are  non-hedge  derivatives (see accounting policy U below). The AFS category is used where the relevant long-term business liability (including shareholders' funds) is  passively  managed, as well as in certain fund management and non-insurance operations.\n\nPurchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is  the  date  that  the  Group  commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the assets, at their fair values.\n\nDebt securities are initially recorded at their fair value, which is taken to be amortised cost, with amortisation credited or charged to the income  statement.  Investments  classified  as  trading,  other  than trading and AFS, are subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the  fair  value  of  trading  and  other  than  trading  investments  are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.\n\nChanges in the fair value of securities classified as AFS are recognised in  other  comprehensive  income  and  recorded  in  a  separate investment  valuation  reserve  within  equity.  When  securities classified  as  AFS  are  sold  or  impaired,  the  accumulated  fair  value adjustments are transferred out of the investment valuation reserve to the income statement with a corresponding movement through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe  Group  reviews  the  carrying  value  of  its  AFS  investments  on  a regular  basis.  If  an  AFS  investment  is  deemed  to  be  impaired,  the impairment  losses  are  recognised  as  a  charge  to  the  income statement in the period in which they occur. The following policies are used to determine the level of any impairment, some of which involve considerable judgement.\n\n## AFS debt securities\n\nAn AFS debt security is impaired if there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred which has impaired the expected cash flows, i.e. where all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  are  not  considered  collectible.  An  impairment  charge, measured  as  the  difference  between  the  security's  fair  value  and amortised cost, is recognised when the issuer is known to be either in default or in financial difficulty. Determining when an issuer is in financial difficulty requires the use of judgement, and we consider a number of factors including industry risk factors, financial condition, liquidity position and near-term prospects of the issuer, credit rating declines  and  a  breach  of  contract.  A  decline  in  fair  value  below amortised cost due to changes in risk-free interest  rates  does  not necessarily represent objective evidence of a loss event.\n\nFor securities identified as being impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss previously recognised within the investment valuation reserve is transferred  to  realised  losses  for  the  year,  with  a  corresponding movement through other comprehensive income. Any subsequent increase  in  fair  value  of  these  impaired  securities  is  recognised  in other  comprehensive  income  and  recorded  in  the  investment valuation reserve unless this increase represents a decrease in the impairment loss that can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement. In such an event, the reversal of the impairment loss is recognised as a gain in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "Accounting policies continued\n\n## AFS equity securities\n\nAn  AFS  equity  security  is  considered  impaired  if  there  is  objective evidence  that  the  cost  may  not  be  recovered.  In  addition  to qualitative impairment criteria, such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Unless there is evidence to  the  contrary,  an  equity  security  is  considered  impaired  if  the decline in fair value relative to cost has been either at least 20% for a continuous six-month period or more than 40% at the end of the reporting  period,  or  been  in  an  unrealised  loss  position  for  a continuous  period  of  more  than  12  months  at  the  end  of  the reporting  period.  We  also  review  our  largest  equity  holdings  for evidence  of  impairment,  as  well  as  individual  equity  holdings  in industry sectors known to be in difficulty. Where there is objective evidence  that  impairment  exists,  the  security  is  written  down regardless of the size of the unrealised loss.\n\nFor securities identified as being impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss previously recognised within the investment valuation reserve is transferred  to  realised  losses  for  the  year  with  a  corresponding movement through other comprehensive income.\n\nAny subsequent increase in fair value of these impaired securities is recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  recorded  in  the investment valuation reserve.\n\nReversals of impairments on any of these assets are only recognised where the decrease in the impairment can be objectively related to an event occurring after the write-down (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), and are not recognised in respect of equity instruments.\n\n## (U) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate futures, currency and interest rate swaps, currency and interest  rate  options  (both  written  and  purchased)  and  other financial instruments that derive their value mainly from underlying interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  credit  or  equity  indices, commodity values or equity instruments.\n\nAll  derivatives  are  initially  recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial position at their fair value, which usually represents their cost. They are  subsequently  remeasured  at  their  fair  value.  Fair  values  are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not available, by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair  values  are  positive  and  as  liabilities  when  the  fair  values  are negative. Premiums paid for derivatives are recorded as an asset on the  statement  of  financial  position  at  the  date  of  purchase, representing their fair value at that date.\n\nDerivative  contracts  may  be  traded  on  an  exchange  or  over-thecounter  (OTC).  Exchange-traded  derivatives  are  standardised  and include  certain  futures  and  option  contracts.  OTC  derivative contracts  are  individually  negotiated  between  contracting  parties and include forwards, swaps, caps and floors. Derivatives are subject to various risks including market, liquidity and credit risk, similar to those  related  to  the  underlying  financial  instruments.  Many  OTC transactions  are  contracted  and  documented  under  International Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  master  agreements  or  their equivalent, which are designed to provide legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, reducing the Group's exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe  notional  or  contractual  amounts  associated  with  derivative financial instruments are not recorded as assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position as they do not represent the fair value of these transactions. These amounts are disclosed in note 60(b).\n\nThe Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group  entities  and  relevant  counterparties.  Accounting  policy  W covers  collateral,  both  received  and  pledged,  in  respect  of  these derivatives.\n\n## Interest rate and currency swaps\n\nInterest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments, calculated on a specified notional amount and defined interest rates. Most interest rate swap payments are netted against each other, with the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest  payments  paid  by  one  party.  Currency  swaps,  in  their simplest form, are contractual agreements that involve the exchange of both periodic and final amounts in two different currencies. Both types of swap contracts may include the net exchange of principal. Exposure to gain or loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as a function of maturity dates, interest and foreign exchange rates, and the timing of payments.\n\n## Interest rate futures, forwards and options contracts\n\nInterest rate futures are exchange-traded instruments and represent commitments to purchase or sell  a  designated  security  or  money market instrument at a specified future date and price.\n\nInterest  rate  forward  agreements  are  OTC  contracts  in  which  two parties agree on an interest rate and other terms that will become a reference point in determining, in concert with an agreed notional principal  amount,  a  net  payment  to  be  made  by  one  party  to  the other, depending upon what rate prevails at a future point in time. Interest rate options, which consist primarily of caps and floors, are interest  rate  protection  instruments  that  involve  the  potential obligation of the seller to pay the buyer an interest rate differential in exchange  for  a  premium  paid  by  the  buyer.  This  differential represents the difference between current rate and an agreed rate applied to a notional amount. Exposure to gain or loss on all interest rate contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as interest  rates  fluctuate.  Certain  contracts,  known  as  swaptions, contain features which can act as swaps or options.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nForeign exchange contracts, which include spot, forward and futures contracts,  represent  agreements  to  exchange  the  currency  of  one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement  date.  Foreign  exchange  option  contracts  are  similar  to interest  rate  option  contracts,  except  that  they  are  based  on currencies, rather than interest rates.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is applied to certain transactions which meet the criteria set out in IAS 39, in order to mitigate the Group's exposure to risk.  At  the  inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as  well  as  the  risk  management  objective  and  the  strategy  for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documents its assessment of whether the hedge is expected to be, and has been, highly  effective  in  offsetting  the  risk  in  the  hedged  item,  both  at inception and on an ongoing basis.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges) or a hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction or a firm commitment (cash flow hedges), and that prove to be highly effective  in  relation  to  the  hedged  risk,  are  recognised  in  other comprehensive income and a separate reserve within equity. Gains and losses accumulated in this reserve are included in the income statement on disposal of the relevant investment or occurrence of the cash flow as appropriate.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and  qualify  as  a  hedge  of  the  fair  value  of  a  recognised  asset  or liability (fair value hedges) are recognised in the income statement. The gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "This applies even if the hedged item is an available for sale financial asset or is measured at amortised cost. If a hedging relationship no longer  meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting,  the  cumulative adjustment  made  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  hedged  item  is amortised  to  the  income  statement,  based  on  a  recalculated effective interest rate over the residual period to maturity. In cases where  the  hedged  item  has  been  derecognised,  the  cumulative adjustment is released to the income statement immediately.\n\nThe Group does not currently apply the specific hedge accounting rules to its derivative transactions which are treated as derivatives held for trading. The fair value gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised immediately in net investment income.\n\n## (V) Loans\n\nLoans with fixed maturities, including policyholder loans, mortgage loans on investment property, securitised mortgages and collateral loans, are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers. Certain loans are carried at their unpaid principal balances and adjusted for amortisation of premium or discount, non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs. These amounts are deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as an adjustment to loan yield using the effective interest rate method.\n\nHowever, for the majority of mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage  of  the  fair  value  option  under  IAS  39  to  present  the mortgages, associated borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more  relevant information  and  eliminates  any  accounting  mismatch  that  would otherwise arise  from  using  different  measurement  bases  for  these three items. The fair values of these mortgages are estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate which  reflects  the  risks  associated  with  these  products.  They  are revalued  at  each  period  end,  with  movements  in  their  fair  values being taken to the income statement.\n\nAt each reporting date, we review loans carried at amortised cost for objective evidence that they are impaired and uncollectable, either at the level of an individual security or collectively within a group of loans with similar credit risk characteristics. To the extent that a loan is  uncollectable,  it  is  written  down  as  impaired  to  its  recoverable amount, measured as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan, taking into  account the fair value of the underlying collateral through an impairment provision account. Subsequent recoveries in excess of the loan's written-down carrying value are credited to the income statement.\n\nThe Company classifies and measures loans at either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit  or  loss  based  on  the  outcome  of  an  assessment  of  the Company's business model for managing financial assets and the extent to which the financial assets' contractual cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nThe  Company  calculates  expected  credit  losses  for  all  financial assets  held  at  either  amortised  cost  or  fair  value  through  other comprehensive  income.  Expected  credit  losses  are  calculated  on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on the extent to which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n## (W) Collateral\n\nThe Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or noncash  assets  in  respect  of  stock  lending  transactions,  certain derivative contracts and loans, in order to reduce the credit risk of these  transactions.  Collateral  is  also  pledged  as  security  for  bank letters of credit. The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.\n\nCollateral  received  in  the  form  of  cash,  which  is  not  legally segregated  from  the  Group,  is  recognised  as  an  asset  in  the statement of financial position with a corresponding liability for the repayment in financial liabilities (see note 61). However, where the Group has a currently enforceable legal right of set-off and the ability and  intent  to  settle  net,  the  collateral  liability  and  associated derivative  balances are shown net. Non-cash collateral received is not  recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  unless  the transfer of the collateral meets the derecognition criteria from the perspective of the transferor. Such collateral is typically recognised when  the  Group  either  (a)  sells  or  repledges  these  assets  in  the absence  of  default,  at  which  point  the  obligation  to  return  this collateral is recognised as a liability; or (b) the counterparty to the arrangement  defaults,  at  which  point  the  collateral  is  seized  and recognised as an asset.\n\nCollateral pledged in the form of cash, which is legally segregated from  the  Group,  is  derecognised  from  the  statement  of  financial position with a corresponding receivable recognised for its return. Non-cash collateral pledged is not derecognised from the statement of  financial  position  unless  the  Group  defaults  on  its  obligations under  the  relevant  agreement,  and  therefore  continues  to  be recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  within  the appropriate asset classification.\n\n## (X) Deferred acquisition costs and other assets\n\nCosts relating to the acquisition of new business for insurance and participating investment contracts are deferred in line with existing local accounting practices, to the extent that they are expected to be recovered out of future margins in revenues on these contracts. For participating  contracts  written  in  the  UK,  acquisition  costs  are generally not deferred as the liability for these contracts is calculated on  a  realistic  basis  which  was  grandfathered  from  UK  regulatory requirements prior to  the  adoption  of  Solvency  II  (see  accounting policy  L).  For  non-participating  investment  and  investment  fund management  contracts,  incremental  acquisition  costs  and  sales enhancements  that  are  directly  attributable  to  securing  an investment management service are also deferred.\n\nLong-term  business  deferred  acquisition  costs  are  amortised systematically over a period no longer than that in which they are expected  to  be  recoverable  out  of  these  future  margins.  Deferred acquisition  costs  for  non-participating  investment  and  investment fund management contracts are amortised over the period in which the  service  is  provided.  General  insurance  and  health  deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned. The reinsurers' share of deferred acquisition costs is amortised in the same manner as the underlying asset.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs are reviewed by category of business at the end of each reporting period and are written-off where they are no longer considered to be recoverable.\n\nWhere such business is reinsured, an appropriate proportion of the deferred acquisition costs is attributed to the reinsurer. Recoverability  is  assessed  net  of  reinsurance,  and  may  result  in deferred acquisition costs being written-off if any liability recognised for the reinsurer's share is insufficient.\n\nOther receivables and payables are initially recognised at cost, being fair value. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (Y) Statement of cash flows Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  at  bank  and  in  hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly  liquid  investments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known amounts of  cash  and  which  are  subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of change in value.",

        "page_content": "Accounting policies continued\n\nSuch investments are those with less than three months' maturity from the date of acquisition, or which are redeemable on demand with only an insignificant change in their fair values.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash equivalents  also  include  bank  overdrafts,  which  are  included  in payables and other financial liabilities on the statement of financial position.\n\n## Operating cash flows\n\nPurchases  and  sales  of  investment  property,  loans  and  financial investments  are  included  within  operating  cash  flows  as  the purchases  are  funded  from  cash  flows  associated  with  the origination of insurance and investment contracts, net of payments of related benefits and claims.\n\n## (Z) Leases\n\nWhere the Group is the lessee, a lease liability equal to the present value of outstanding lease payments and a corresponding right-ofuse asset equal to cost are initially recognised. The right-of-use asset is  subsequently measured at amortised cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease term. Depreciation on lease  assets  and  interest  on  lease  liabilities  is  recognised  in  the income statement.\n\nThe Group has made use of the election available under IFRS 16 to not  recognise  any  amounts  on  the  balance  sheet  associated  with leases  that  are  either  deemed  to  be  short  term,  or  where  the underlying asset is of low value. A short-term lease in this context is defined as any arrangement which has a lease term of 12 months or less.  Lease  payments  associated  with  such  arrangements  are recognised in the income statement as an expense on a straight-line basis. The Group's total short term and low value lease portfolio is not material.\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor, leases are classified as finance leases if the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the  lessee  and  operating  leases  if  they  are  not  substantially transferred. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments,  together  with  any  unguaranteed  residual  value,  is recognised  as  a  receivable.  The  Group  has  not  entered  into  any material finance lease arrangements as lessor.\n\n## (AA) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Group  has  a  present  legal  or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more probable than not that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount  of  the  obligation  can  be  made.  Restructuring  provisions include  lease  termination  penalties  and  employee  termination payments. They comprise only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those that are necessarily entailed by the restructuring; and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity. The amount recorded as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the  provision  is  the  present  value  of  the  expected  expenditure. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n\nWhere the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits  to  be  derived  from  a  contract  are  less  than  the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\nContingent  liabilities  are  disclosed  if  there  is  a  possible  future obligation as a result of a past event, or if there is a present obligation as a result of a past event but either a payment is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\n## (AB) Employee benefits Pension obligations\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes, whose members receive benefits on either a defined benefit or defined contribution basis.  Under  a  defined  contribution  plan,  the  Group's  legal  or constructive  obligation  is  limited  to  the  amount  it  agrees  to contribute  to  a  fund  and  there  is  no  obligation  to  pay  further contributions  if  the  fund  does  not  hold  sufficient  assets  to  pay benefits. A defined benefit pension plan is a pension plan that is not a  defined  contribution  plan  and  typically  defines  the  amount  of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.\n\nThe  defined  benefit  obligation  is  calculated  by  independent actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  The  pension obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, using a discount rate based on market yields for highquality  corporate  bonds  that  are  denominated  in  the  currency  in which  the  benefits  will  be  paid  and  that  have  terms  to  maturity approximating  to  the  terms  of  the  related  pension  liability.  The resultant net surplus or deficit recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nPlan assets exclude unpaid contributions due from Group entities to the schemes, and any non-transferrable financial instruments issued by a Group entity and held by the schemes. If the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the resultant asset is limited to the asset ceiling defined as present value of economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in contributions to the plan. In order to calculate  the  present  value  of  economic  benefits,  consideration  is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group.\n\nRemeasurements of defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and  losses  arising  from  experience  adjustments  and  changes  in actuarial  assumptions,  the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  net interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any).  The  Group recognises  remeasurements  immediately  in  other  comprehensive income and does not reclassify  them  to  the  income  statement  in subsequent periods.\n\nService  costs  comprising  current  service  costs,  past  service  costs, gains and losses on curtailments and net interest expense/income are charged or credited to the income statement.\n\nPast service costs are recognised at the earlier of the date the plan amendment  or  curtailment  occurs  or  when  related  restructuring costs are recognised.\n\nThe Group determines the net interest expense/income on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of  the  year  to  the  net  defined  benefit  liability/asset.  Net  interest expense is charged to finance costs, whereas, net interest income is credited to investment income.\n\nFor  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Group  pays  contributions  to publicly or privately administered  pension  plans.  Once  the contributions have been paid, the Group, as employer, has no further payment obligations. The Group's contributions are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate and are included in staff costs.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nAccounting policies continued\n\n## Equity compensation plans\n\nThe Group offers share award and option plans over the Company's ordinary shares for certain employees, including a Save As You Earn plan  (SAYE  plan),  details  of  which  are  given  in  the  Directors' Remuneration Report and in note 33.\n\nThe  Group  accounts  for  options  and  awards  under  equity compensation  plans,  which  were  granted  after  7  November  2002, until  such  time  as  they  are  fully  vested,  using  the  fair  value  based method of accounting (the 'fair value method'). Under this method, the cost of providing equity compensation plans is based on the fair value of the share awards or option plans at date of grant, which is recognised  in  the  income  statement  over  the  expected  vesting period  of  the  related  employees  and  credited  to  the  equity compensation  reserve,  part  of  shareholders'  funds.  In  certain jurisdictions, awards must be settled in cash instead of shares, and the credit is taken to liabilities rather than reserves. The fair value of these cash-settled awards is recalculated each year, with the income statement charge and liability being adjusted accordingly.\n\nShares purchased by employee share trusts to fund these awards are shown  as  deduction  from  shareholders'  equity  at  their  weighted average cost.\n\nWhen  the  options  are  exercised  and  new  shares  are  issued,  the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital  (par  value)  and  the  balance  to  share  premium.  Where  the shares  are  already  held  by  employee  trusts,  the  net  proceeds  are credited against the cost of these shares, with the difference between cost and proceeds being taken to retained earnings. In both cases, the  relevant  amount  in  the  equity  compensation  reserve  is  then credited to retained earnings.\n\n## (AC) Income taxes\n\nThe current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, after  any  adjustments  in  respect  of  prior  years.  Tax,  including  tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over profits before taxation and  amounts  charged  or  credited  to  components  of  other comprehensive income and equity, as appropriate.\n\nProvision  is  made  for  deferred  tax  liabilities,  or  credit  taken  for deferred  tax  assets,  using  the  liability  method,  on  all  material temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  rates  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at  the  statement  of financial position date are used to value the deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that  future  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which  the temporary differences can be utilised. Where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on any temporary differences arising from investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint  ventures,  except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred taxes are not provided in respect of temporary differences arising  from  the  initial  recognition  of  goodwill,  or  from  the  initial recognition  of  an  asset  or  liability  in  a  transaction  which  is  not  a business  combination  and  affects  neither  accounting  profit  nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of available for sale investments,  pensions  and  other  post-retirement  obligations  and other amounts charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  as  a deferred  tax  asset  or  liability.  Current  tax  on  interest  paid  on  the direct capital instrument is credited to the income statement. In prior periods, the accounting policy was to recognise the credit directly in equity. The change in accounting policy followed an amendment to IAS 12 as part of the IASB's Annual improvements to IFRS standards 2015-2017 cycle which required the tax consequences  of distributions from certain equity instruments to be recognised in the income statement. There is no restatement of 2019 comparatives as the impact of this change is not material.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions, where management expects it is more likely than  not  that  an  economic  outflow  will  occur  as  a  result  of examination  by  a  relevant  tax  authority.  Provisions  reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation  of  tax  law,  precedent  and  guidance,  informed  by external tax advice as necessary. The final amounts of tax due may ultimately  differ  from  management's best estimate at the balance sheet  date.  Changes  in  facts  and  circumstances  underlying  these provisions  are  reassessed  at  each  balance  sheet  date,  and  the provisions are re-measured as required to reflect current information.\n\nIn addition to paying tax on shareholders' profits (shareholder tax), the Group's life businesses in the UK, Ireland and Singapore pay tax on  policyholders'  investment  returns  (policyholder  tax)  on  certain products at policyholder tax rates. The incremental tax borne by the Group represents income tax on policyholder's investment return. In jurisdictions where policyholder tax is applicable, the total tax charge in the income statement is allocated between shareholder tax and policyholder tax. The shareholder tax is calculated by applying the corporate tax rate to the shareholder profit. The difference between the total tax charge and shareholder tax is allocated to policyholder tax. This calculation methodology is consistent with the legislation relating to the calculation of tax on shareholder profits. The Group has decided to show separately the amounts of policyholder tax to provide a meaningful measure of the tax the Group pays on its profit. In the pro forma reconciliations, the Group adjusted operating profit has been calculated after charging policyholder tax.\n\n## (AD) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings  are  classified  as  being  for  either  core  structural  or operational  purposes.  They  are  recognised  initially  at  their  issue proceeds  less  transaction  costs  incurred.  Subsequently,  most borrowings are stated at amortised cost, and any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement  over  the  period  of  the  borrowings  using  the  effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred  except  where  they  are  directly  attributable  to  the acquisition or construction of property and equipment as described in accounting policy P.\n\nWhere  loan  notes  have  been  issued  in  connection  with  certain securitised mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage of the fair value option under IAS 39 to present the mortgages, associated liabilities and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch  which  would  otherwise  arise  from  using  different measurement bases for these three items.\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  tax  relating  to  items  recognised  in  other comprehensive  income  and  directly  in  equity  are  similarly recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  directly  in  equity respectively.",

        "page_content": "## (AE) Share capital and treasury shares Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Accordingly, a financial instrument is treated as equity if:\n\n- (i) there  is  no  contractual  obligation  to  deliver  cash  or  other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on terms that may be unfavourable; and\n- (ii)  the instrument is a non-derivative that contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of shares or is a derivative that will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of  cash  or  other  assets  for  a  fixed  number  of  the  Group's  own equity instruments.\n\n## Share issue costs\n\nIncremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares  are  shown  in  equity  as  a  deduction,  net  of  tax,  from  the proceeds of the issue and disclosed where material.\n\n## Dividends\n\nInterim dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends on these shares are recognised  when  they  have  been  approved  by  shareholders. Dividends on preference shares are recognised in the period in which they are declared and appropriately approved.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhere  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries  purchase  the  Company's share  capital  or  obtain  rights  to  purchase  its  share  capital,  the consideration paid (including any attributable transaction costs net of income taxes) is shown as a deduction from total shareholders' equity. Gains and losses on own shares are charged or credited to the treasury share account in equity.\n\n## (AF) Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets  and  income  arising  from  fiduciary  activities,  together  with related  undertakings  to  return  such  assets  to  customers,  are excluded from these financial statements where the Group has no contractual rights in the assets and acts in a fiduciary capacity such as nominee, trustee or agent.\n\n## (AG) Earnings per share\n\nBasic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the weighted average number of treasury shares.\n\nEarnings  per  share  has  also  been  calculated  on  Group  adjusted operating  profit  attributable  to  ordinary  shareholders,  net  of  tax, non-controlling  interests,  preference  dividends,  the  direct  capital instrument (the DCI) and tier one notes as the directors believe this figure provides a better indication of operating performance. Details are given in note 15.\n\nFor the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary  shares  in  issue  is  adjusted  to  assume  conversion  of  all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as convertible debt and share options granted to employees.\n\nPotential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.\n\n## (AH) Operations held for sale\n\nAssets and liabilities held for disposal as part of operations which are held for sale are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position. Operations held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less the estimated selling costs.\n\n## (AI) Discontinued operations\n\nDiscontinued  operations  comprise  those  activities  that  were disposed of or classified as held for sale at the end of the period and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area that can clearly be distinguished for operational and financial reporting purposes.\n\nThe results of discontinued operations are presented as a single line in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows and comparatives are re-presented where applicable. Notes  to  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  are presented on a total group basis and, as a result, income statement and  cash  flow  movements  included  within  these  notes  may  not reconcile to those presented in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of cash flows.

This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the onerous contracts arise as a result of disposal transactions which we consider to be strategic in nature. Also included is a charge of \u00a318 million relating to the estimated additional liability arising in the UK defined benefit pension schemes as a result of the requirement to equalise members' benefits for the effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) for former members. This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the additional liability arose as a consequence of a further High Court judgement in November 2020 in the case involving Lloyds Banking Group and does not reflect the financial performance of the Group for the year. Other in 2019 relates to a charge of \u00a345 million in relation to a change in the discount rate used for estimating lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims and a charge of \u00a32 million relating to negative goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Friends First.\n\nThe above reconciliation of group adjusted operating profit to profit for the year should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies and accompanying notes to the financial statements.\n\n1",

The sale of its entire shareholding in Aviva Vietnam Life Insurance Limited has been agreed and is subject to regulatory approval, expected in 2021.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations , the results of these operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements, as they represent an exit from a single geographical area of business. Profit  from discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2020 has been shown as a single line in the consolidated income statement and net cash flows from discontinued operations have been shown as a single line in the consolidated statement of cash flows, with 2019 comparatives re-presented accordingly. Further analysis of the results from discontinued operations is provided in note 4(d).\n\n## (b)  Amendment to segmental analysis\n\nAt our interim results announcement on 6 August 2020, we announced our strategic priorities to focus on building and extending leadership in  the  UK,  Ireland  and  Canada  (Core  markets),  and  managing  our  other  international  businesses  for  long-term  shareholder  value (Manage- for-value markets). As a result, the financial performance of our 'Core markets' are presented as UK & Ireland Life, General Insurance (which brings together our UK & Ireland General Insurance businesses and Canada) and Aviva Investors. Our 'Manage-for-value markets' consist of our other international businesses: France, Italy, Poland and Other. The 2019 comparative results have been restated from those previously published to reclassify operations on this basis. See note 5 for further information.\n\n## 2 - Significant events in the current reporting period\n\nOn 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. Governments in affected areas have imposed a number of measures designed to contain the outbreak, including business closures, travel restrictions, stay at home orders and prohibition of gatherings and events. The spread of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the global economy, causing volatile equity markets and falls in interest rates.\n\nIn our interim results announcement on 6 August 2020, we assessed the emerging situation and provided details of the significant impacts of COVID-19 on the Group's results for the first half of 2020. The Group has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through its operations, insurance products and assets holdings as well as ongoing difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the wider macroeconomic environment. The effects of COVID-19 continue to present unprecedented uncertainty that may adversely impact the results of the Group. However, the strength of the Group's capital and liquidity means it is well positioned to manage this crisis and continue to support customers.\n\nThis note sets out key considerations in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's results.\n\n## Business and performance\n\n## (i) Long-term business\n\nThe Group's life insurance business is long-term in nature. As such the ultimate impact of COVID-19 has a high degree of uncertainty and will emerge over a long period of time. The reported results include a net \u00a316 million increase in long-term insurance contract liabilities as a result of the changes in non-economic assumptions for COVID-19, noting that this includes the offsetting impacts of an increase attributable to mortality and a decrease attributable to longevity assumptions. The valuation of the Group's long-term insurance liabilities is closely linked to market movements and therefore the impact of COVID-19 on global markets has had a consequential impact on the valuation of the Group's long-term business. It is not possible however to disaggregate the impact of the pandemic from wider economic movements in the period, and as such quantification of the economic impact of COVID-19 on long term insurance contract liabilities is not possible. The effect of COVID-19 on assumptions and estimates for the long-term business is set out in note 47.\n\n## (ii)  General insurance\n\nThe estimated impact of COVID-19 on the general insurance results in the year is \u00a3(17) million, principally reflecting business interruption claims net of reinsurance, which were partly offset by favourable impacts of reduced economic activity in other product lines tempered by higher profit-contingent commission payments to distributors. Further information on the impact of COVID-19 on general insurance liabilities can be found within note 42(c) and note 59(f).\n\n## (ii) Fund management\n\nThe widespread economic disruption caused by of COVID-19 has led to significant volatility in financial markets and elevated levels of investor activity throughout 2020. Information on the revenue earned by the Group's fund management segment can be found within note 5(b).\n\n## Risk profile\n\nNote 59 has been updated to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on the risk environment within which the Group operates and the way in which the pandemic has had an impact on the Group's material risk exposures. This includes descriptions of key actions taken to mitigate these changes in risk exposures during 2020.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nIn addition to the increased volatility in financial markets, the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 has led to declines in the level of trading in some asset classes giving rise to additional valuation uncertainty. Information on the fair value of the Group's assets and liabilities and the methodology for calculating this fair value can be found within note 24.",

In 2020, a revised structure was agreed for Aviva to sell a 76% shareholding in FPI for a consideration of \u00a3259 million, including \u00a350 million of deferred consideration.\n\nThe classification as held for sale has resulted in a loss on remeasurement of \u00a3118 million in 2017, \u00a313 million in 2018, \u00a328 million in 2019 and an additional remeasurement loss of \u00a319 million at 30 June 2020. The transaction completed on 16 July 2020.\n\nOn 11 December 2020, an option was exercised by RL360 requiring Aviva to recapture a book of business from FPI, subject to regulatory approval, resulting in Aviva forgoing both the deferred consideration and its remaining shareholding in FPI. The estimated value of the book of  business  matches  the  total  value  of  the  deferred  consideration  and  the  shareholding,  therefore  there  is  no  impact  on  the  value  of consideration received.\n\n## (ii) Singapore\n\nOn 11 September 2020, Aviva announced the sale of a majority shareholding in Aviva Singapore to a consortium led by Singapore Life Ltd (Singlife) for a consideration of SGD 2.7 billion (approximately \u00a31.5 billion), which is comprised of SGD 2.0 billion in cash and marketable securities, SGD 250 million in vendor finance notes and a 26% equity shareholding in the new group (Aviva Singlife Holdings Pte. Ltd - see note 19(a)). The transaction completed on 30 November 2020.\n\n## (iii) Other\n\nOn 6 March 2020, Aviva announced the sale of its entire shareholding in its joint venture in Indonesia, PT Astra Aviva Life, to the joint venture partner, PT Astra International Tbk. The consideration received was INR 1,389 billion (approximately \u00a372 million). The transaction completed on 16 November 2020.\n\nOn 20 November 2019, Aviva announced the sale of its entire 40% shareholding in its Hong Kong joint venture (Blue) to Hillhouse AV Holdings Limited for HKD 450 million (approximately \u00a344 million).

There are no protective rights of non-controlling interests which significantly restrict the Group's ability to access or use the assets and settle the liabilities of the Group.\n\n## (f) Subsequent events\n\nFor the following subsequent events, management undertook an assessment of the facts and circumstances at 31 December 2020 and concluded that for each of the transactions, the IFRS 5 criteria for classification as held for sale were not met at that date.\n\n## (i) Aviva France\n\nOn  23  February  2021,  Aviva  announced  it  had  approved  the  sale  of  its  entire  shareholding  in  Aviva  France  to  A\u00e9ma  Groupe  for  cash consideration  of  \u20ac3.2  billion  (approximately  \u00a32.9  billion),  including  \u20ac1.1  billion  (approximately  \u00a31.0  billion)  in  respect  of  Aviva  France's intra-group debt. The transaction will significantly strengthen the Group's capital and liquidity on completion, and covers the French life, general insurance, and asset management businesses and the 75% shareholding in L'Union Financi\u00e8re de France, a wealth manager listed on the Paris Bourse. The transaction is subject to consultation and customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to complete in the second half of 2021. The transaction would have decreased the Group's IFRS net asset value by approximately \u00a30.5 billion, increased Solvency II surplus on a shareholder basis by approximately \u00a30.8 billion and strengthened the Solvency II cover ratio on a shareholder basis by approximately 22 percentage points as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## (ii) AvivaSA (Turkey)\n\nOn 24 February 2021, Aviva announced the sale of its entire 40% shareholding in its joint venture in Turkey, AvivaSA Emeklilik ve Hayat AS (AvivaSA),  to  Ageas  Insurance  International  N.V.  for  cash  consideration  of  \u00a3122  million.  The  transaction  is  subject  to  customary  closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is expected to complete in 2021.",

The sale of the remaining Life business primarily comprises the entire 100% shareholding in Aviva Life S.p.A. and the 51% shareholding in Aviva S.p.A. to CNP Assurances for cash consideration of \u20ac543 million (approximately \u00a3486 million). The sale of the General Insurance business comprises the  entire  100%  shareholding  in  Aviva  Italia  S.p.A.  to  Allianz  for  cash  consideration  of  \u20ac330  million  (approximately  \u00a3295  million).  The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and anti-trust approvals, and are expected to complete in the second half of 2021. The transactions would have increased the Group's IFRS net asset value by approximately \u00a30.2 billion, increased Solvency II  surplus  on  a  shareholder  basis  by  approximately  \u00a30.2  billion  and  strengthened  the  Solvency  II  cover  ratio  on  a  shareholder  basis  by approximately 7 percentage points as at 31 December 2020. Following completion of these transactions, Aviva will retain Aviva Italia Holdings S.p.A, which will have no underlying operating insurance entities.\n\n## 5 - Segmental information\n\nThe Group's results can be segmented either by activity or by geography. Our primary reporting format is along market reporting lines, with supplementary  information  being  given  by  business  activity.  This  note  provides  segmental  information  on  the  consolidated  income statement. At our 2020 interim results announcement on 6 August 2020, we announced our strategic priorities to focus on building and extending our leadership in the UK, Ireland and Canada (Core markets), and managing International businesses for long-term shareholder value (Manage-for-value markets). As a result, the financial performance of our 'Core markets' is presented as UK & Ireland Life, General Insurance (which brings together our UK & Ireland businesses and Canada) and Aviva Investors. Our 'Manage-for-value markets' consists of our other international businesses: France, Italy, Poland and Other. The 2019 comparative results have been restated (see note 1) from those previously published to reclassify operations to reflect these changes. Segmental information is presented for continuing operations only, an analysis of results from discontinued operations is presented in note 4(d).\n\n## (a)  Operating segments UK & Ireland Life\n\nThe principal activities of our UK & Ireland Life operations are life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business.\n\n## General Insurance\n\nThe principal activities of our UK & Ireland General Insurance operations are the provision of insurance cover to individuals and businesses, for risks associated mainly with motor vehicles, property and liability (such as employers' liability and professional indemnity liability) and medical expenses.\n\n## UK & Ireland\n\n## Canada\n\nThe principal activity of our Canada General Insurance operation is the provision of personal and commercial lines insurance products principally distributed through insurance brokers.\n\n## Aviva Investors\n\nAviva Investors operates in most of the markets in which the Group operates, in particular the UK, France, North America and Asia Pacific.

Group  adjusted operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for operating items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in operating assumptions. Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit, in investment variances and economic assumption changes.\n\n## (a)  Definitions\n\n## (b)  Methodology\n\nThe  expected  investment  returns  and  corresponding  expected  movements  in  life  business  liabilities  are  calculated  separately  for  each principal life business unit.\n\nThe expected return on investments for both policyholders' and shareholders' funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period. Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year. The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equity and property. Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.\n\nThe actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as  well  as  movements in interest rates.  To  the  extent  that  these  differences  arise  from  the  operating  experience  of  the  life  business,  or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the Group adjusted operating profit. The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside Group adjusted operating profit but included in profit before tax attributable to shareholders' profits.\n\nThe movement in liabilities included in Group adjusted operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items. This would include movements in liabilities due to changes in the discount rate arising from discretionary management decisions that impact on product profitability over the lifetime of products.\n\nThe effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside Group adjusted operating profit. For many types of life business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit. The profit impact of economic volatility on other life business depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 9 - Life business investment variances and economic assumption changes continued\n\n## (c)  Assumptions\n\nThe expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions at the start of the period between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equity and property are:\n\n|                | Equity   | Equity   | Property   | Property   |\n|----------------|----------|----------|------------|------------|\n|                | 2020     | 2019     | 2020       | 2019       |\n| United Kingdom | 4.5%     | 4.9%     | 3.0%       | 3.4%       |\n| France 1       | 4.5%     | 4.3%     | 3.5%       | 2.8%       |\n| Other Eurozone | 3.7%     | 4.3%     | 2.2%       | 2.8%       |\n\nThe expected return on equity and property has been calculated by reference to the ten-year mid-price swap rate for an AA rated bank in the relevant currency plus a risk premium. The use of risk premium reflects management's long-term expectations of asset return in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes. The asset risk premiums are set out in the table below:\n\n| All territories       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity risk premium   | 3.5%   | 3.5%   |\n| Property risk premium | 2.0%   | 2.0%   |\n\nThe ten-year mid-price swap rates at the start of the period are set out in the table below:\n\n| Territories    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| United Kingdom | 1.0%   | 1.4%   |\n| Eurozone       | 0.2%   | 0.8%   |\n\nFor fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk (assessed on a best estimate basis). This includes an adjustment for credit risk on all eurozone sovereign debt. Where such securities are classified as available for sale, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.\n\n## (d)  Investment variances and economic assumption changes\n\nThe investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the life adjusted operating profit are as follows:\n\n|                                               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Life business                                 | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n| Investment variances and economic assumptions | 174    | 654    |\n\nInvestment variances and economic assumption changes were \u00a3174 million positive (2019: \u00a3654 million positive) , mainly due to a reduction in yields, partially offset by a reduction in equities in the UK and France.\n\nAt 31 December 2019 we included a specific allowance for the possible adverse impacts of the UK's exit from the European Union on UK commercial and residential property, which we have now removed. Our future property growth assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis and as at 31 December 2020 they include a cumulative 5-year growth assumption, from 2021-25, of -1% for UK commercial property (with variation by sector) and 4% for UK residential property.\n\nInvestment variance and economic assumption changes in 2019 was primarily due to the UK where there was a positive variance as a result of a reduction in yields, a narrowing of fixed income spreads and a consequent impact from economic assumption changes, including an alignment of methodology across the UK, partially offset by the impact of increases in equities. The impact of yields and equities reflect that we hedge on an economic rather than on an IFRS basis.\n\n## 10 - Non-life business: short-term fluctuations in return on investments (a) Definitions\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for non-life business is based on an expected long-term investment return over the period. Any variance between the total investment return (including realised and unrealised gains) and the expected return over the period is disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit, in short-term fluctuations.\n\nThe short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-life business result and reported outside Group adjusted operating profit were as follows:\n\n| Non-life business                                            | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Short-term fluctuations in investment return (see (d) below) | (64)        | 167         |\n| Economic assumption changes (see (e) below)                  | (104)       | (54)        |\n|                                                              | (168)       | 113         |\n\n## (b) Methodology\n\nThe long-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-life market. In respect of equities and investment properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the long-term rate of investment return.",

The allocated long-term return for other investments (including debt securities) is the actual income receivable for the year. Actual income and long-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts/premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities. For other operations, the long-term return reflects assets backing non-life business held in Group centre investments.\n\nMarket value movements which give rise to variances between actual and long-term investment returns are disclosed separately in shortterm fluctuations outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe impact of realised and unrealised gains and losses on Group centre investments, including the centre hedging programme which is designed to economically protect the total Group's capital against adverse equity and foreign exchange movements, is included in shortterm fluctuations on other operations.\n\n## (c) Assumptions\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the long-term investment return are:\n\n|                | Long-term rates   of return equities   | Long-term rates   of return equities   | Long-term rates   of return properties   | Long-term rates   of return properties   |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                | 2020                                   | 2019                                   | 2020                                     | 2019                                     |\n|                | %                                      | %                                      | %                                        | %                                        |\n| United Kingdom | 4.5                                    | 4.9                                    | 3.0                                      | 3.4                                      |\n| France 1       | 4.5                                    | 4.3                                    | 3.5                                      | 2.8                                      |\n| Other eurozone | 3.7                                    | 4.3                                    | 2.2                                      | 2.8                                      |\n| Canada         | 5.7                                    | 6.0                                    | 4.2                                      | 4.5                                      |\n\nThe long-term rates of return on equities and properties have been calculated by reference to the ten-year mid-price swap rate for an AA rated bank in the relevant currency plus a risk premium.

These losses are partly offset by an increase in the value of fixed income securities as a result of falls in interest rates.\n\nThe short-term fluctuations during 2019 were mainly due to strong market conditions across all our major markets. This resulted in significant gains on equities plus gains on fixed income securities driven by interest rates falling and a narrowing of credit spreads. These gains are partly offset by losses on hedges held by the Group, including the Group centre hedging programme, and other adverse movements on centre holdings.\n\n## (e) Economic assumption changes\n\nIn the general insurance and health business, there is a negative impact of \u00a3104 million (2019: \u00a354 million negative) primarily as a result of a decrease in the interest rates used to discount claims reserves for both periodic payment orders (PPOs) and latent claims.\n\nAs explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims. The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below Group adjusted operating profit as an economic assumption change. The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 43.",

As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profits and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Group's pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge/(credit) attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.\n\nThe rate of corporation tax in the UK was due to be reduced from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020. In addition, the French government has introduced a stepped reduction to the French corporation tax rate from 34.43% to 25.83% from 1 January 2022. These reduced rates were used in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the UK and France at 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring 2020, the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate that was due to take effect from 1 April 2020 was cancelled and as a result, the rate has remained at 19%. This revised rate has been used in the calculation of the UK's deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2020 and increased the Group's deferred tax liabilities by \u00a381 million.\n\n## 15 - Earnings per share\n\nThis note shows how to calculate earnings per share on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, based both on the present shares in issue (the basic earnings per share) and the potential future shares in issue, including conversion of share options granted to employees (the diluted earnings per share).

Interest payable up to 23 June 2020 has been recorded as an appropriation of retained profits with the remaining interest payable from 24 June 2020 until the redemption date recorded within profit before tax attributable to shareholders' profits. In prior periods, the interest on the DCI and tier 1 notes was treated as an appropriation of retained profits and, accordingly, accounted for when paid.\n\n## 17 - Goodwill\n\nThis note analyses the changes to the carrying amount of goodwill during the year and details the results of our impairment testing on both goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\n## (a)  Carrying amount\n\n|                                          | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gross amount                             |             |             |\n| At 1 January                             | 1,968       | 1,991       |\n| Acquisitions and additions               | -           | 4           |\n| Disposals                                | (55)        | (5)         |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements          | 8           | (22)        |\n| At 31 December                           | 1,921       | 1,968       |\n| Accumulated impairment                   |             |             |\n| At 1 January                             | (113)       | (119)       |\n| Impairment charges                       | (16)        | (6)         |\n| Disposals                                | 16          | -           |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements          | (3)         | 12          |\n| At 31 December                           | (116)       | (113)       |\n| Carrying amount at 1 January             | 1,855       | 1,872       |\n| Carrying amount at 31 December           | 1,805       | 1,855       |\n| Less: Assets classified as held for sale | (6)         | -           |\n| Carrying amount at 31 December           | 1,799       | 1,855       |\n\nDisposals in 2020 relate to the disposals of FPI, Singapore and a small disposal in Canada.

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the cash generating unit unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Long-term business\n\nValue in use has been calculated based on a shareholder value of the business calculated in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders' interests. The principal adjustments relate to the exclusion of the benefit of transitional measures on technical provisions and the volatility adjustment under Solvency II, modification of the Solvency II risk margin to an economic view and removal of restrictions on contract boundaries or business scope.\n\nThe present value of expected profits arising from future new business may be included within the shareholder value and is calculated on an adjusted Solvency II basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management. These plans reflect management's best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit. The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.\n\nFuture new business profits beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate. Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.\n\nExpected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate. The discount rate is a combination of a riskfree rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe Solvency II non-economic assumptions in relation to mortality, morbidity, persistency and expenses and other items are based on management's best estimate assumptions. Economic assumptions are based on market data as at the end of each reporting period. The basic risk-free rate curves used to value the technical provisions reflect the curves, credit risk adjustment and fundamental spread for the matching adjustment published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) on their website. For the purposes of calculating value in use, the Solvency II risk margin has been modified to an economic view, with a cost of capital rate of 2%.\n\n## General insurance, health, fund management and other businesses\n\nValue in use is calculated as the discounted value of expected future profits of each business. The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three-year period. These plans reflect management's best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit. The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.\n\nCash flows beyond that three-year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate. Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.\n\nFuture profits are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate which is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The inputs include the risk-free rate of interest appropriate to the geographic location of the cash flows related to each CGU being tested, market risk premium, beta and other adjustments to factor local market risks and risks specific to each CGU.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\n|                                             | Extrapolated future   profits growth rate   | Extrapolated future   profits growth rate   | Future profits   discount rate   | Future profits   discount rate   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                             | 2020                                        | 2019                                        | 2020   (Pre-tax)                 | 2019   (Pre-tax)                 |\n|                                             | %                                           | %                                           | %                                | %                                |\n| United Kingdom general insurance and health | 1                                           | 1                                           | 7.5                              | 6.8                              |\n| Ireland general insurance and health        | Nil                                         | Nil                                         | 7.7                              | 6.8                              |\n| Italy general insurance and health          | Nil                                         | Nil                                         | 11.0                             | 10.3                             |\n| Canada general insurance                    | 5                                           | 4                                           | 8.7                              | 8.0                              |",

The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of Aviva's share of the subsidiary to which it relates.\n\n## Results of impairment testing\n\nManagement's impairment review of the Group's cash generating units identified the need to impair goodwill by a total amount of \u00a316 million which relates to two different cash generating units within the Canada operating segment. This impairment is due to current and forecast performance of the related cash generating units being below the original financial plan.\n\n## 18 - Acquired value of in-force business (AVIF) and intangible assets\n\nThis note shows the movements in cost, amortisation and impairment of the acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets during the year.\n\n|                                          | AVIF on  insurance  contracts 1  (a)  \u00a3m   | AVIF on  investment  contracts 2  (a)  \u00a3m   | Other  intangible  assets with  finite useful  lives (b)   \u00a3m   | Intangible  assets with  indefinite  useful lives (c)  \u00a3m   | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Gross amount                             |                                            |                                             |                                                                 |                                                             |              |\n| At 1 January 2019                        | 2,692                                      | 2,726                                       | 1,623                                                           | 134                                                         | 7,175        |\n| Additions and transfers                  | -

Of the total of \u00a31,742 million, \u00a31,553 million (2019: \u00a32,380 million) is expected to be recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.\n\nNon-participating investment AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment, consistent with reviews conducted for other finite life intangible assets.  Insurance  and  participating  investment  contract  AVIF  is  reviewed  for  impairment  at  each  reporting  date  as  part  of  the  liability adequacy requirements in IFRS 4. AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment and impairment tested at product portfolio level by reference to the value of future profits in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders' interests, consistent with the impairment test for goodwill for long term business (see note 17(b)).",

Additions of intangible assets with finite lives in 2020 and 2019 relate to capitalisation of software costs in relation to the Group's digital initiatives. Impairments totalling \u00a323 million have been recognised in 2020 in relation to capitalised software.\n\n## (c)  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives primarily comprise the value of distribution channel Union Financi\u00e8re de France Banque in France where the existing life of the asset supports this classification. Impairment testing of these intangible assets is covered in note 17(b). No impairment has been recognised in 2020 (2019: \u00a3nil) .\n\n## 19 - Interests in, and loans to, joint ventures\n\nIn several businesses, Group companies and other parties jointly control certain entities.

At 31  December  2020  this  includes  a  contingent  liability  in  respect  of  a  dispute  where  the  Group's  maximum  exposure  is  approximately \u00a365 million (2019: \u00a395 million) . In the opinion of the directors it is unlikely that the Group will suffer financial loss arising from this dispute. The joint ventures have no other contingent liabilities to which the Group has significant exposure. The Group has commitments to provide funding to property management joint ventures of \u00a34 million (2019: \u00a313 million) .\n\nIn certain jurisdictions the ability of joint ventures to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances made by the Group is subject to local corporate or insurance laws and regulations and solvency requirements.\n\n## (b)  Impairment testing\n\nInterests in joint ventures are tested for impairment of goodwill and intangibles when there is an indicator of impairment. They are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill or intangible relates to the recoverable value of that cash generating unit. Recoverable amount for long-term and general insurance businesses is calculated on a consistent basis with that used for impairment testing of goodwill, as set out in note 17(b). The recoverable amount of property management undertakings is the fair value less costs to sell of the joint venture, measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for investment property (see accounting policy Q).\n\n## 20 - Interests in, and loans to, associates\n\nThis note analyses our interests in entities which we do not control but where we have significant influence.\n\n## (a)  Carrying amount and details of associates\n\n- (i) The movements in the carrying amount comprised:\n\n|                                    | 2020  Equity  interests   \u00a3m   | 2019  Equity   interests   \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| At 1 January                       | 304                            | 304                             |\n| Share of results before tax        | 18                             | 80                              |\n| Share of tax                       | 11                             | (4)                             |\n| Share of results after tax         | 29                             | 76                              |\n| Impairment                         | (13)                           | (9)                             |\n| Share of profit after tax          | 16                             | 67                              |\n| Additions                          | 3                              | 2                               |\n| Disposals                          | (38)                           | -                               |\n| Reduction in Group interest        | (3)                            | (1)                             |\n| Dividends received from associates | (18)                           | (54)                            |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements    | (1)                            | (14)                            |\n| Movements in carrying amount       | (41)                           | -                               |\n| At 31 December                     | 263                            | 304                             |\n\nDisposals of \u00a338 million represents the Group's interest in Lend Lease JEM Partners Fund Limited which formed part of the sale of a majority shareholding in Aviva Singapore, as set out in note 4(b).\n\nThe Group's share of total comprehensive income related to associates is \u00a316 million (2019: \u00a367 million) .\n\n- (ii)  No associates are considered to be material from a Group perspective (2019: none) .

This assessment is in accordance with UK Valuations Standards 'Red book', and is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably and without compulsion, on the basis of the highest and best use of asset that is physically possible, legally permissible  and  financially  feasible.  The  valuation  assessment  adopts  market-based  evidence  and  is  in  line  with  guidance  from  the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment .\n\nSimilar  considerations  apply  to  properties  under  construction,  where  an  estimate  is  made  of  valuation  when  complete,  adjusted  for anticipated costs to completion, profit and risk, reflecting market conditions at the valuation date.",

Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 23.\n\n## 23 - Lease assets and liabilities\n\nOn 1 January 2019 the Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases , the standard which replaced IAS 17 Leases . Adoption of the standard resulted in assets previously held under operating leases (and their corresponding lease liabilities) being recognised on the statement of financial position for the first time within the comparative numbers. Adoption of the standard resulted in the following assets and liabilities being included within the statement of financial position for the first time at 1 January 2019:\n\n- \u221e \u00a3410 million owner-occupied property assets, included within Property and equipment (see note 21);\n- \u221e \u00a324 million deferred tax assets; and\n- \u221e \u00a3544 million lease liabilities, included within Payables and other financial liabilities (see note 53).\n\nThe Group's leased assets primarily consist of properties occupied by Group companies carried at amortised cost (see note 21) and leasehold investment properties carried at fair value (see note 22) which are sublet to third parties. Leasehold investment properties are measured in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property (see accounting policy Q).\n\nAlthough the Group is exposed to changes in the residual value at the end of the current leases to third parties on investment property, the Group typically enters into new operating leases and therefore is not expected to immediately realise any reduction in residual value at the end of these leases. Expectations about the future residual values are reflected in the fair value of the properties.\n\n- (i) The following amounts in respect of leased assets have been recognised in the Group's consolidated income statement.\n\n|                                                         |   2020  \u00a3m |   2019  \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                   |         10 |         14 |\n| Total lease expenses recognised in the income statement |         10 |         14 |\n\nTotal cash outflows recognised in the period in relation to leases were \u00a376 million (2019: \u00a370 million) .  Expenses recognised in the Group consolidated income statement in relation to short-term and low-value leases were \u00a3nil (2019: \u00a3nil) . Variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities were \u00a3nil (2019: \u00a3nil) .\n\n- (ii) The following table analyses the right-of-use assets, primarily relating to leased properties occupied by Group companies.\n\n|                                   | 2020  Total  \u00a3m   | 2019  Total  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Balance at 1 January              | 385               | 410               |\n| Additions                         | 66                | 42                |\n| Disposals                         | (9)               | (1)               |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements   | 2                 | (4)               |\n| Impairment of right-of-use assets | (40)              | -                 |\n| Depreciation                      | (66)              | (62)              |\n| Balance at 31 December            | 338               | 385               |",

Future contractual aggregate minimum lease payments are as follows:\n\n|                                              |   2020  \u00a3m |   2019  \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Within 1 year                                |        152 |         89 |\n| Later than 1 year and not later than 5 years |        214 |        296 |\n| Later than 5 years                           |        198 |        237 |\n|                                              |        564 |        622 |\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nThe lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.\n\n(iv) Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:\n\n|                       | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Within 1 year         | 266        | 265        |\n| Between 1 and 2 years | 223        | 205        |\n| Between 2 and 3 years | 193        | 183        |\n| Between 3 and 4 years | 162        | 161        |\n| Between 4 and 5 years | 179        | 208        |\n| Later than 5 years    | 1,233      | 1,599      |\n|                       | 2,256      | 2,621      |\n\n## 24 - Fair value methodology\n\nThis note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and for fair value disclosures. It also provides an analysis of these according to a 'fair value hierarchy', determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.\n\n## (a)  Basis for determining fair value hierarchy\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the 'fair value hierarchy' described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.\n\n## Level 2\n\nInputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument. Level 2 inputs include the following:\n\n- \u221e Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.\n- \u221e Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.\n- \u221e Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads).\n- \u221e Market corroborated inputs.\n\nWhere we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows:\n\n- \u221e Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2.\n- \u221e In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.\n\n## Level 3\n\nInputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business  unit  considers  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability.  Examples  are  investment  properties  and commercial and equity release mortgage loans.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 24 - Fair value methodology continued\n\n## (a)  Basis for determining fair value hierarchy continued\n\nThe majority of the Group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on quoted market information or observable market data. Of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value 16.7% (2019: 16.8%) of assets and 1.2% (2019: 3.1%) of liabilities are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3. Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed  models,  calibrated  to  market  observable  data  where  possible.  Third-party  valuations  using  significant  unobservable  inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the thirdparty price and the internally modelled value. Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2.\n\n## (b)  Changes to valuation techniques\n\nThere were no changes in the valuation techniques during the year compared to those described in the 2019 annual consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (c)  Comparison of the carrying amount and fair values of financial instruments\n\nSet out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, excluding those classified as held for sale. These amounts may differ where the assets or liabilities are carried on a measurement basis other than fair value, e.g. amortised cost.\n\n|                                                     | 2020            | 2020                  | 2019            | 2019                  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                     | Fair value   \u00a3m | Carrying  amount   \u00a3m | Fair value   \u00a3m | Carrying  amount   \u00a3m |\n| Financial assets                                    |                 |                       |                 |                       |\n| Loans (note 25(a))                                  | 43,672          | 43,679                | 38,559          | 38,579                |\n| Financial investments (note 28(a))                  | 351,378         | 351,378               | 343,418         | 343,418               |\n| Fixed maturity securities                           | 202,837         | 202,837               | 198,832         | 198,832               |\n| Equity securities                                   | 100,404         | 100,404               | 99,570          | 99,570                |\n| Other investments (including derivatives)           | 48,137          | 48,137                | 45,016          | 45,016                |\n| Financial liabilities                               |                 |                       |                 |                       |\n| Non-participating investment contracts (note 44(a)) | 135,347         | 135,347               | 129,365         | 129,365               |\n| Net asset value attributable to unitholders         | 20,301          | 20,301                | 16,610          | 16,610                |\n| Borrowings (note 52(a)) 1                           | 11,141          | 9,684                 | 10,268          | 9,039                 |\n| Derivative liabilities (note 60(b))                 | 7,562           | 7,562                 | 6,517           | 6,517                 |\n\nFair value of the following assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts:\n\n- \u221e Receivables\n- \u221e Cash and cash equivalents\n- \u221e Loans at amortised cost\n- \u221e Payables and other financial liabilities\n\nAs set out in accounting policy A, the Group has chosen to defer application of IFRS 9 due to its activities being predominantly connected with insurance.

These  valuations  are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis. Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes. Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied. When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced from brokers.\n\nOver-the-counter derivatives are valued using broker quotes or models such as option pricing models, simulation models or a combination of  models.  The  inputs  for  these  models  include  a  range  of  factors  which  are  deemed  to  be  observable,  including  current  market  and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.\n\nUnit Trusts and other investment funds included under the other investments category are valued using net asset values which are not subject to a significant adjustment for restrictions on redemption or for limited trading activity.\n\n## (f) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy\n\nFor  financial  instruments  that  are  recognised  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis,  the  Group  determines  whether  transfers  have  occurred between levels of the fair value hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2\n\n\u00a31.0 billion of assets transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 relate to fixed maturity securities held by our business in France, primarily due to a reclassification of certain securities from government debt to corporate bonds. There were no significant transfers from Level 2 to Level 1.\n\n## Transfers to/from Level 3\n\n\u00a3810 million of assets transferred into Level 3 and \u00a31,042 million of assets transferred out of Level 3 relate principally to fixed maturity securities  held  by  our  businesses  in  the  UK  and  France.  These  are  transferred  between  Levels  2  and  3  depending  on  the  availability  of observable inputs and whether the counterparty and broker quotes are corroborated using valuation models with observable inputs.\n\nThere were no significant transfers of liabilities into and out of Level 3 during the year.\n\n## (g)  Further information on Level 3 assets and liabilities\n\nThe table below shows movement in the Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\n|                                                                | Assets Liabilities       | Assets Liabilities   | Assets Liabilities              | Assets Liabilities      | Assets Liabilities                               | Assets Liabilities                                   | Assets Liabilities                             | Assets Liabilities                                   | Assets Liabilities           | Assets Liabilities   | Assets Liabilities                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                                                           | Investment  Property  \u00a3m | Loans   \u00a3m           | Fixed  maturity  securities  \u00a3m | Equity  securities   \u00a3m | Other  investments  (including  derivatives)  \u00a3m | Financial  assets  classified as  held for sale   \u00a3m | Non  participating  investment  contracts   \u00a3m | Net asset  value  attributable  to  unitholders   \u00a3m | Derivative  liabilities   \u00a3m | Borrowings   \u00a3m      | Financial  liabilities  classified as  held for sale   \u00a3m |\n| Opening balance at 1 January 2020                              | 11,203                   | 28,319               | 17,595                          | 720                     | 5,673                                            | 1,986                                                | -

Net gains of \u00a3423 million (2019: net gains of \u00a31,427 million) attributable to assets and net gains of \u00a3147 million (2019: net losses of \u00a3271 million) attributable to liabilities relate to those still held at the end of the year.\n\nThe principal assets classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are described below.\n\n## (i) Investment property\n\n- \u221e Investment property is valued in the UK at least annually by external chartered surveyors in accordance with guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and using estimates during the intervening period. Valuations have been performed more frequently since the onset of COVID-19 and have taken place at least quarterly, with a particular focus on sectors deemed to be exposed to higher risk of default as a result of the pandemic, such as retail. Valuations have been performed for all UK properties since the onset of COVID-19. Outside the UK, valuations are produced by external qualified professional appraisers in the countries concerned. Investment properties are valued on an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no further growth in the estimated rental value of the property. The uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties. These inputs are deemed unobservable. External valuations relating to properties in the retail and leisure sectors include a capital deduction where tenant risk is deemed to have increased as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## (ii)  Loans\n\n- \u221e Commercial mortgage loans and Primary Healthcare loans held by our UK Life business are valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model. This model calculates a Credit Risk Adjusted Value for each loan. The risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using a yield curve, taking into account the term dependent gilt yield curve and global assumptions for the liquidity premium. Loans valued using this model have been classified as Level 3 as the liquidity premium is deemed to be non-market observable. The liquidity premium used in the discount rate ranges between 80 bps to 110 bps (2019: 65 bps to 80 bps) .\n- \u221e Equity release mortgage loans held by our UK Life business are valued using an internal model, with fair value initially being equal to the transaction price. The value of these loans is dependent on the expected term of the mortgage and the forecast property value at the end of  the  term,  and  is  calculated  by  adjusting  future  cash  flows  for  credit  risk  and  discounting  using  a  yield  curve  plus  an  allowance  for illiquidity. At 31 December 2020 the illiquidity premium used in the discount rate was 190 bps (2019: 160 bps) .\n- \u221e The mortgages have a no negative equity guarantee ('NNEG') such that the cost of any potential shortfall between the value of the loan and the realised value of the property, at the end of the term, is recognised by a deduction to the value of the loan. Property valuations at the reporting date are obtained by taking the most recent valuation for the property and indexing using market observable regional house price indices. NNEG is calculated using base property growth rates reduced for the cost of potential dilapidations, using a stochastic model. In addition, a cost of capital charge is applied to reflect the variability in these cash flows. The base property growth rate assumption is RPI +0.75% which equates to a long-term average growth rate of 4.0% pa at 31 December 2020 (2019: 4.0%) . After applying the cost of capital charge, dilapidations and the stochastic distribution, the effective net long-term growth rate equates to 0.6% pa (2019: 0.5%) .\n- \u221e At 31 December 2019 mortgage loan assumptions included a specific allowance for the possible adverse impacts of the UK's exit from the European Union on UK commercial and residential property, which have now been removed. Our future property growth assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis and as at 31 December 2020 they include a cumulative 5-year growth assumption, from 2021-25, of -1% for UK commercial property (with variation by sector) and 4% for UK residential property.\n- \u221e Infrastructure and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) loans held by our UK Life business are valued using a discounted cash flow model. This adds spreads for credit and illiquidity to a risk-free discount rate. Credit spreads used in the discount rate are calculated using an internally developed methodology which depends on the credit rating of each loan, credit spreads on publicly traded bonds and an estimated recovery rate in event of default and are deemed to be unobservable.",

They have been classified as Level 3 because either (i) the third-party models include a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment, or (ii) differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model are sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.\n- \u221e Non-standard debt products and privately placed bonds held by our businesses in the UK do not trade in an active market. These fixed maturity securities are valued using discounted cash flow models, designed to appropriately reflect the credit and illiquidity risk of the instrument. These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because the valuation approach includes significant unobservable inputs and an element of subjectivity in determining appropriate credit and illiquidity spreads.\n- \u221e Fixed maturity securities held by our French, UK and Asian businesses which are not traded in an active market have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations. These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.\n\n## (iv) Equity securities\n\n- \u221e Equity securities which primarily comprise private equity holdings held in the UK are valued by a number of third party specialists. These are valued using a range of techniques, including earnings multiples, forecast cash flows and price/earnings ratios which are deemed to be unobservable.\n\n## (v) Other investments (including derivatives)\n\n- \u221e Other investments are held for index-linked, unit-linked and with-profit funds and are valued based on external valuation reports received from fund managers. The investments consist of:\n- -Other investment funds including property funds;\n- -Unit trusts;\n- -External hedge funds held principally by business in the UK and France; and\n- -Derivatives.\n- \u221e Where valuations are at a date other than the balance sheet date, as is the case for some private equity funds, adjustments are made for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions and the fund manager's carried interest.\n\n## (vi) Financial assets of operations classified as held for sale\n\n- \u221e Financial assets of operations classified as held for sale are held by our Asia and Italian businesses and consist primarily of discretionary managed funds of \u00a3538 million (2019: \u00a31,404 million) and fixed maturity securities which are not traded in an active market and have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations of \u00a3487 million (2019: \u00a3401 million). These assets are included within the relevant asset category within the sensitivity table below.\n\n## (vii) Liabilities\n\nThe principal liabilities classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are:\n\n- \u221e Securitised mortgage loan notes, presented within Borrowings, are valued using a similar technique to the related Level 3 securitised mortgage assets.\n- \u221e \u00a3nil million (2019: \u00a33,045 million ) of non-participating investment contract liabilities. Comparative figures were included within financial liabilities of operations classified as held for sale. These were classified as Level 3, either because the underlying unit funds were classified as Level 3 or because the liability related to unfunded units or other non-unit adjustments which were based on a discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable market data and assumptions. These liabilities are included within the relevant asset category within the sensitivity table below.\n\nWhere these valuations are at a date other than the balance sheet date, as in the case of some private equity funds, adjustments are made to reflect items such as subsequent drawdowns and distributions and the fund manager's carried interest.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe valuation of Level 3 assets involves a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty due to the reliance of valuation models on unobservable  inputs.  Where  possible,  the  Group  tests  the  sensitivity  of  the  fair  values  of  Level  3  assets  and  liabilities  to  changes  in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives. Level 3 valuations are sourced from independent third parties when available and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes. Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis:\n\n- \u221e For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally-modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.\n- \u221e For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input. Sensitivities are determined by flexing inputs of internal models to a reasonable alternative, including the yield, NAV multiple or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation. For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the security's contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.",

In  particular,  certain  assets  relying  on comparable market transactions for a valuation, such as investment properties within the leisure and hospitality sectors, have been more difficult to value due to a reduction in the level of available market evidence. A number of property valuers have included 'material uncertainty declarations' in their valuation reports on these assets to reflect this. The pandemic has also increased uncertainty in relation to long term economic assumptions such as residential and commercial property growth rate assumptions.\n\nThe tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative:\n\n|                                                           |                 |                                              |                         | Sensitivities         | Sensitivities         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2020                                                      | Fair value  \u00a3bn | Most significant unobservable input          | Reasonable  alternative | Positive  Impact  \u00a3bn | Negative  Impact  \u00a3bn |\n| Investment property                                       | 11.4            | Equivalent rental yields                     | +/- 5-10%               | 0.8                   | (0.8)                 |\n| Loans                                                     |                 |                                              |                         |                       |                       |\n| Commercial mortgage loans and Primary Healthcare loans    | 12.6            | Illiquidity premium                          | +/- 20 bps              | 0.2                   | (0.2)                 |\n|                                                           |                 | Base property growth rate                    | +/- 100 bps p.a.        | 0.1                   | (0.1)                 |\n| Equity release mortgage loans                             | 11.8            | Base property growth rate                    | +/- 40 bps p.a.         | 0.2                   | (0.2)                 |\n|                                                           |                 | Current property market values               | +/- 10%                 | 0.3                   | (0.4)                 |\n| Infrastructure and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) loans | 4.9             | Illiquidity premium                          | +/- 25 bps 1            | 0.2                   | (0.2)                 |\n| Other                                                     | 0.5             | Illiquidity premium                          | +/- 25 bps 1            | -

Further details of the fair value methodology and models utilised are given in note 24(g).\n\nThe  cumulative  change  in  fair  value  of  loans  attributable  to  changes  in  credit  risk  to  31  December  2020  was  a  \u00a31,302  million  loss (2019: \u00a31,224 million loss) .\n\nHealthcare, infrastructure and PFI other loans of \u00a37,283 million (2019: \u00a36,467 million) are secured against the income from healthcare and educational premises.\n\nNon-securitised  mortgage  loans  include  \u00a39,360  million (2019:  \u00a38,558  million) of  residential  equity  release  mortgages,  \u00a37,518  million (2019: \u00a37,681 million) of commercial mortgages and \u00a32,804 million (2019: \u00a32,878 million) relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses. The healthcare and PFI mortgage loans are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises. For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan. Although the loan principal is not government-guaranteed, the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.",

The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities (see note 53).\n\nThe Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate in order to reduce the risk of non-recovery. This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above. In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.\n\n## 26 - Securitised mortgages and related assets\n\nThe Group, in its UK Life business, has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings. This note gives details of the relevant transactions.\n\n## (a)  Description of current arrangements\n\nIn a UK long-term business subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies), in return for initial consideration and, at later dates,  deferred  consideration.  The  deferred  consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments. The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.\n\nAll the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust. Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it has control of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements. AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.\n\nAER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies. In addition, Group companies have invested \u00a3230 million (2019: \u00a3224 million) in loan notes issued by the ERF companies. These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the statement of financial position.\n\nIn all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support. Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.",

The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll  of  the  investment  vehicles  in  the  investment  portfolio  are  managed  by  portfolio  managers  who  are  compensated  by  the  respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance- based incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (a)  Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has determined that where it has control over investment vehicles, these investments are consolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2020 the Group has granted loans to consolidated PLPs for a total of \u00a361 million (2019: \u00a364 million) . The purpose of these loans is to assist the consolidated PLPs to purchase or construct properties. The Group has also provided support, without having a contractual obligation  to  do  so,  to  certain  consolidated  PLPs  via  letters  of  support  amounting  to  \u00a368  million (2019:  \u00a357  million) .  The  Group  has commitments to provide funding to consolidated structured entities of \u00a34 million (2019: \u00a3nil) .\n\nThe Group has also given support to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies) that are consolidated structured entities. As set out in note 26, at the inception of the securitisation vehicles, the UK subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), has granted subordinated loan facilities to some of the ERF companies. AER receives various fees in return for the services provided to the entities. AER receives cash management fees based on the outstanding loan balance at the start of each quarter for the administration of the loan note liabilities. AER receives portfolio administration fees as compensation for managing the mortgage assets. Refer to note 26 for details of securitised mortgages and related assets as at 31 December 2020.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group has no intentions to provide financial or other support in relation to any other investment vehicles.\n\n## (b)  Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAs part of its investment activities, the Group invests in unconsolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group's total interest in unconsolidated structured entities was \u00a355,961 million (2019: \u00a358,519 million) on the Group's statement of financial position. The Group's total interest in unconsolidated structured entities is classified as 'Interests in and loans to joint ventures and associates' and 'financial investments held at fair value through profit or loss'. The Group does not sponsor any of the unconsolidated structured entities.",

In some cases, the Group may be required to absorb losses from an unconsolidated structured entity before other parties when and if Aviva's interest is more subordinated with respect to other owners of the same security.\n\nFor commitments to property management joint ventures and associates, please refer to notes 19 and 20, respectively. The Group has not provided any other financial or other support in addition to that described above as at the reporting date, and there are no intentions to provide support in relation to any other unconsolidated structured entities in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn  relation  to  risk  management, disclosures on debt securities and investment vehicles are given in note 59(b)(ii) 'Risk management'. In relation  to  other  guarantees  and  commitments that the Group provides in the course of its business, please see note 55(f) 'Contingent liabilities and other risk factors'.\n\nAviva's interest in unconsolidated structured entities that it also manages at 31 December 2020 is \u00a31,803 million (2019: \u00a31,919 million) and the total funds under management relating to these investments at 31 December 2020 is \u00a316,012 million (2019: \u00a315,454 million) .\n\n## (c)  Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group receives management fees and other fees in respect of its asset management businesses. The Group does not sponsor any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees. Management fees received for investments that the Group manages, but does not have a holding in, also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities. As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Group's maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees. The table below shows the assets under management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those entities.\n\n|                                  | 2020                          | 2020                              | 2019                          | 2019                              |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                  | Assets Under  Management   \u00a3m | Investment  Management  Fees   \u00a3m | Assets Under  Management   \u00a3m | Investment  Management  Fees   \u00a3m |\n| Investment funds 1               | 6,690                         | 30                                | 6,885                         | 32                                |\n| Specialised investment vehicles: | 3,658                         | 23                                | 3,108                         | 10                                |\n| Analysed as:                     |                               |                                   |                               |                                   |\n| OEICs                            | 410                           | 10                                | 33                            | -                                 |\n| PLPs                             | 3,248                         | 13                                | 3,075                         | 10                                |\n| Total                            | 10,348                        | 53                                | 9,993                         | 42                                |",

Of this net loss, \u00a34,079 million net loss (2019: \u00a317,920 million net gain) related to investments designated as other than trading and \u00a3238 million net gain (2019: \u00a3478 million net gain) related to financial investments designated as trading.\n\nThe movement in the unrealised gain/loss position reported in the statement of financial position during the year, shown in the table above, includes foreign exchange movements on the translation of unrealised gains and losses on financial investments held by foreign subsidiaries, which are recognised in other comprehensive income, as well as transfers due to the realisation of gains and losses on disposal and the recognition of impairment losses.\n\n## (c)  Financial investment arrangements\n\n## (i) Stock lending arrangements\n\nThe Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas in accordance with established market conventions. The majority  of  the  Group's  stock  lending  transactions  occur  in  the  UK,  where  investments  are  lent  to  EEA-regulated,  locally  domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.\n\nThe Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements, either in the form of securities or cash. See note 61 for further discussion regarding collateral positions held by the Group.\n\n## (ii)  Other arrangements\n\nIn carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Group's UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders. Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits. At 31 December 2020, \u00a32,621 million (2019: \u00a32,472 million) of financial investments were restricted in this way.\n\nCertain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries. Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.",

DAC for general insurance and health business increased slightly over 2020.\n\nWhere amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit. It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by \u00a3116 million (2019: \u00a329 million) if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by \u00a3135 million (2019: \u00a336 million) if yields were to reduce by 1%.\n\nAt both 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the DAC balance has been restricted by the value of projected future profits.\n\n## 31 - Pension surpluses, other assets, prepayments and accrued income (a)  Pension surpluses and other assets - carrying amount\n\nThe carrying amount comprises:\n\n|                                                     | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Surpluses in the staff pension schemes (note 51(a)) | 2,780       | 2,746       |\n| Other assets                                        | 55          | 53          |\n| Total                                               | 2,835       | 2,799       |\n| Less: Assets classified as held for sale            | (1)         | -           |\n|                                                     | 2,834       | 2,799       |\n\nSurpluses in the staff pension schemes and \u00a32 million (2019: \u00a31 million) of other assets are recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.\n\n## (b)  Prepayments and accrued income\n\nPrepayments  and  accrued  income  of  \u00a32,865  million (2019:  \u00a33,151  million) include  assets  classified  as  held  for  sale  of  \u00a3123  million (2019: \u00a38 million) and \u00a362 million (2019: \u00a330 million) that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.",

Holders are entitled to receive dividends out of the profits available for distribution and resolved to be distributed in priority to the payment of dividends to holders of ordinary shares. The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the fair value of Aviva plc's preference share capital was \u00a3303.6 million (2019: \u00a3299 million).\n\nFollowing our March 2018 statement in the full year 2017 results that we 'have the ability to cancel our preference shares', Aviva listened to the views of investors, who expressed concerns, and as a result Aviva subsequently announced on 23 March 2018 that it had decided to take 'no action to cancel its preference shares'. On 30 April 2018 Aviva announced a charge of \u00a314 million relating to a provision for the goodwill payment scheme to those preference shareholders who sold preference shares in the period from 8 to 22 March 2018 (inclusive) at a share price that was lower than the price that the preference shares returned to following the announcement on 23 March 2018. The total cost of the goodwill payment scheme was \u00a310 million relating to the goodwill payments to preference shareholders, and associated administration costs, against our initial estimate of \u00a314 million.\n\nOn 26 October 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority published the outcome of its investigation into Aviva's announcement on preference shares  in  March  2018,  which  found  that  Aviva  contravened  certain  provisions  of  the  Listing  Rules  and  the  Disclosure  Guidance  and Transparency Rules by failing to take reasonable care to ensure that information in that announcement was not misleading and did not omit anything likely to affect the import of the information in the announcement. Aviva released its response the same day accepting the FCA finding.\n\nUnder current regulation the preference shares will no longer count as regulatory capital in 2026. Aviva will work towards obtaining regulatory approval for the preference shares, or a suitable substitute, to qualify as capital from 2026 onwards. If as we approach 2026 Aviva needs to reconsider this position, it will do so after taking into account the fair market value of the preference shares at that time.\n\nAt the 2020 Annual General Meeting, the Company was authorised to allot sterling new preference shares, as defined in the Company's articles of association, up to a maximum nominal value of \u00a3500 million.\n\n## 37 - Direct capital instrument and tier 1 notes\n\n| Notional amount                                                       | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 5.9021% \u00a3500 million direct capital instrument - Issued November 2004 | -           | 500         |\n| 6.875% \u00a3210 million STICS - Issued November 2003                      | -           | -           |\n| Total                                                                 | -           | 500         |\n\nThe DCI was issued on 25 November 2004. The DCI had no fixed redemption date however, on 23 June 2020 notification was given that the Group would redeem the DCI at its principal amount together with accrued interest to (but excluding) 27 July 2020. The 27 July 2020 being the  first  optional  call  date  for  the  DCI.  On  the  notification  date  the  instrument  was  reclassified  as  a  financial  liability  of  \u00a3499  million, representing its fair value at that date. The resulting difference of \u00a31 million has been charged to retained earnings. On 27 July 2020, the instrument was redeemed in full at a cost of \u00a3500 million.\n\nOn 17 October 2019, notification was given that the Group would redeem the 6.875% \u00a3210 million tier 1 notes. At that date, the instruments were reclassified as a financial liability of \u00a3210 million, representing the fair value at that date. On 21 November 2019 the instruments were redeemed in full at a cost of \u00a3210 million. The difference of \u00a321 million between the carrying amount of \u00a3231 million and fair value of \u00a3210 million was charged to retained earnings.",

In the 'Non-Profit' funds shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits. In the 'With-Profits' sub-funds the with-profits policyholders are entitled to between 40% and 100% of distributed profits, depending on the fund rules. There is also the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account (RIEESA) in the UK, which does not itself underwrite any business, but provides capital support to one of the withprofits sub-funds and receives any surplus or deficit emerging from it. In the RIEESA, shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the 'lock-in' criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met;\n- \u221e In  France,  the  majority  of  policyholders'  benefits  are  determined  by  investment  performance,  subject  to  certain  guarantees,  and shareholders' profits are derived largely from management fees. In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders; and\n- \u221e In other Manage-for-value operations in Europe and Asia, a range of long-term insurance and savings products are written.\n\n## (ii)  Group practice\n\nThe long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each of the Group's life operations. The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nMaterial judgement is required in calculating the liabilities and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is  permitted.  In  turn,  the  assumptions  used  depend on  the  circumstances  prevailing  in  each  of  the  life  operations.  Provisions  are  most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and morbidity rates. Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.\n\nBonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business liabilities.\n\nA description of the main methodology and most material valuation assumptions has been provided (see note 43).",

The gross long-term business liabilities increased by \u00a34.2 billion during 2020 (2019: \u00a35.4 billion increase) mainly driven by:\n\n- \u221e New business net of the expected change on existing business of \u00a32.7 billion, primarily due to growing bulk purchase annuities sales in the UK;\n- \u221e Variance between actual and expected experience of \u00a3(0.4) billion, which was mainly due to lower than expected equity returns in the UK, France and Italy;\n- \u221e Impact of operating assumption changes of \u00a3(0.8) billion mainly due to updates to longevity assumptions (with the impact on profit partially offset by a corresponding reduction in reinsurance assets) in the UK; and\n- \u221e Economic assumption changes of \u00a35.5 billion, which reflects a reduction in valuation interest rates in response to decreasing interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads, primarily in respect of annuity contracts in the UK.\n\nFor participating insurance liabilities, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact profit. Where assumption changes impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year (see note 47), together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.\n\n## (c)  General insurance and health liabilities\n\nThe Group underwrites general insurance and health business in a number of countries as follows:\n\n## (i) Business description\n\n- \u221e In the UK and Ireland, providing individual and corporate customers with a wide range of insurance products;\n- \u221e In Canada, providing a range of personal and commercial lines products; and\n- \u221e In other Manage-for-value operations in Europe, providing a range of general insurance and health products.\n\n## (ii)  Group practice\n\nDelays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date. The liabilities for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.\n\nProvisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) in respect of all claims that have already occurred. The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.\n\nThe Group only establishes reserves for losses that have already occurred. The Group therefore does not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur. When calculating reserves, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.",

Claims are primarily as a result of disruption to business insured by the Group; partially offset by a reduction in claims frequency on other product lines. Further information on the impact of COVID-19 on general insurance and health liabilities can be found within note 59.\n\nSince the ultimate cost of claims is not known in advance, there are uncertainties involved in estimating the loss reserves including those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowances for uncertainties in the reserving process are discussed in note 43.\n\n## (v)  Movements in general insurance and health unearned premiums\n\nThe following changes have occurred in the liabilities for unearned premiums (UPR) during the year:\n\n|                                                  | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Carrying amount at 1 January                     | 5,138       | 4,946       |\n| Premiums written during the year                 | 10,956      | 10,908      |\n| Less: Premiums earned during the year            | (10,807)    | (10,677)    |\n| Changes in UPR recognised as an expense/(income) | 149         | 231         |\n| Gross portfolio transfers and acquisitions 1     | (104)       | -           |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements                  | 27          | (39)        |\n| Carrying amount at 31 December                   | 5,210       | 5,138       |\n\n- 1 The movement during 2020 relates to the disposal of the Singapore business.",

The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year, while the lower section of the tables shows the original estimated ultimate cost of claims and how these original estimates have increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.\n\nKey elements of the development of prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2020 were:\n\n- \u221e \u00a347 million release from the UK and Ireland primarily due to favourable experience in personal property and personal motor lines, partially offset by strengthening across commercial lines due to adverse large claims experience;\n- \u221e \u00a313 million release from Canada primarily due to favourable injury experience in personal motor, offset by strengthening and large loss development in latent claims;\n- \u221e \u00a320 million release from Manage-for-value markets mainly due to favourable claims development in France.\n\nKey elements of the development of prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2019 were:\n\n- \u221e \u00a3134 million release from the UK due to favourable claims experience in personal and commercial motor partly offset by a strengthening in commercial property and a change in the discount rate used for estimating lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims (for further details see note 43);\n- \u221e \u00a358 million release from Canada primarily due to favourable claims experience on personal and commercial motor and large reinsurance recoverable on two catastrophe events from August 2018 in personal and commercial property lines; and\n- \u221e \u00a383 million release from other markets

The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at  31  December 2020 were \u00a387 million (2019: \u00a388 million) . The movement in asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the year reflects a reduction of \u00a311 million due to favourable claims development, claim payments net of reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange movements.\n\n## 43 - Insurance liabilities methodology and assumptions (a) Long-term business\n\nThe  main  method  used  for  the  actuarial  valuation  of  long-term  insurance  liabilities  is  the  gross  premium  method  which  involves  the discounting of projected future cash flows. The cash flows are calculated using the contractual premiums payable together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, discount rates, inflation, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses. These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience with an allowance for prudence.\n\nThe methodology and assumptions described below relate to the UK and France insurance businesses only.\n\n## (i) UK\n\n## Non-profit business\n\nThe valuation of non-profit business is based on grandfathered regulatory requirements under IFRS 4 prior to the adoption of Solvency II, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business. Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profits funds, are valued using the gross premium method . For non-profit business in the ex. Friends Life with-profits funds, the liabilities are measured on a realistic basis with implicit recognition of the present value of future profits.\n\nFor unit-linked and some unitised with-profits business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units. The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows using prudent assumptions and on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nValuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields. An explicit allowance for risk is included by making a deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class. For equity release assets, the risk allowances are consistent with those used in the fair value asset methodology (see note 24). A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.",

For annuity business, the allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions on a prudent basis for defaults or, in the case of equity release assets, expected losses arising from the No-Negative-Equity Guarantee. These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating.\n\nThe risk allowances made for corporate bonds (including overseas government bonds and structured finance assets), mortgages (including healthcare  mortgages,  commercial  mortgages  and  infrastructure  assets),  and  equity  release  equated  to  46  bps,  35  bps,  and  118  bps respectively at 31 December 2020 (2019: 45 bps - 47 bps, 31 bps - 35 bps, and 124 bps respectively) .\n\nThe total valuation allowance in respect of corporate bonds was \u00a31.4 billion (2019: \u00a31.3 billion) over the remaining term of the portfolio at 31 December 2020. The total valuation allowance in respect of mortgages (including healthcare mortgages but excluding equity release) was \u00a30.6 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a30.5 billion). The total valuation allowance in respect of equity release mortgages was \u00a31.7 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a31.5 billion) . Total liabilities for the annuity business were \u00a362.9 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a357.6 billion) .\n\n## Expenses\n\nMaintenance expense assumptions for non-profit business are generally expressed as a per policy charge set with regards to an allocation of current year expense levels by broad category of business and using the policy counts for in-force business. The assumptions also include an allowance for prudence and increase by future expense inflation over the lifetime of each contract. Expense inflation is assumed to be in line with RPI, and in line with external agreements for business administered externally. An additional liability is held if projected per policy expenses  in  future  years  are  expected  to  exceed  current  assumptions.  Further,  explicit  project  expense  liabilities  are  held  for non-discretionary project costs that typically relate to mandatory requirements. Expense-related liabilities are only held where expenses are not covered by anticipated future profits in the liability methodology, notably for unit-linked contracts. Investment expense assumptions are generally expressed as a proportion of the assets backing the liabilities.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality assumptions for non-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.

The CMI\\_2019 tables have been adjusted by adding 0.25% (2019: 0.25%) and 0.35% (2019: 0.35%) to the initial rate of mortality improvements for males and females respectively (to allow for greater mortality improvements in the annuitant population relative to the general population on which CMI\\_2019 is based), and uses the advanced parameters  to  taper  the  long-term  improvement  rates  to  zero  between  ages  90  and  115  (the  'core'  parameters  taper  the  long-term improvement rates to zero between ages 85 and 110). The tapering approach is unchanged from that used at 2019. In addition, on a significant proportion of individual annuity business, year-specific adjustments are made to allow for potential selection effects due to the development of the enhanced annuity market and covering possible selection effects from pension freedom reforms.",

This uses an approach of calculating the realistic liabilities for the contracts. The realistic liabilities include the with-profits benefit reserve (WPBR), and an additional provision for the expected cost of any guarantees and options in excess of the WPBR.\n\nThe WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.\n\nProvisions  for  guarantees  and  options  within  realistic  liabilities  are  measured  using  market-consistent  stochastic  models.  A  stochastic approach includes  measuring  the  time  value  of  guarantees  and  options,  which  represents  the  additional  cost  arising  from  uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions. Non-market-related assumptions (for example, persistency, mortality and expenses) are assessed on a best estimate basis with reference to Company and wider industry experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.\n\nThe with-profits business is valued by adjusting Solvency II Best Estimate Liabilities and results in a valuation in accordance with FRS 27.\n\n## Future investment return\n\nA  risk-free  rate  equal  to  the  spot  yield  on  UK  swaps  is  used  for  the  valuation  of  with-profits  business.  The  rates  vary  according  to  the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2020 of 0.40% (2019: 1.02%) for a policy with ten years outstanding.\n\n## Volatility of investment return\n\nVolatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.\n\n| Volatility       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity returns   | 19.0%  | 16.2%  |\n| Property returns | 15.4%  | 15.8%  |\n\nThe equity volatility used depends on term, moneyness and region. The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a ten-year term.\n\n## Future regular bonuses\n\nAnnual bonus assumptions for 2021 have been set consistently with the year-end 2020 declaration. Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of each fund. In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality assumptions for with-profits business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends. The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below:\n\n| Mortality table used                                              | 2020                                                                               | 2019                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting | Nil or Axx00 adjusted                                                              | Nil or Axx00 adjusted                                                              |\n| Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment | PMA08 HAMWP/PFA08 HAMWP  adjusted plus allowance for future  mortality improvement | PMA08 HAMWP/PFA08 HAMWP  adjusted plus allowance for future  mortality improvement |\n\nAllowance for future mortality improvement is in line with the rates for non-profit business.\n\n## Expenses\n\nMaintenance fee assumptions for with-profits business are generally expressed as a fixed per policy charge in line with a memorandum of understanding between the with-profits funds and the non-profit fund within the company. The memorandum of understanding specifies the charges for a five-year period ending in 2023 and specifies a level of charge inflation during that period of CPI+2% or CPI+3% depending on the product type. After the end of the period covered by the memorandum of understanding we assume that the charges will remain unchanged, and a level of charge inflation of RPI+1% for all products will apply. Any difference of expenses charged by Aviva Life Services UK Limited (UKLS) to Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (AVLAP) over the charges specified by the memorandum of understanding accrues to the non-profit fund.\n\n## Guarantees and options\n\nThe provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options for the with-profits and the non-profit business are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.

For traditional business, the net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.

Case  estimates  are  set  by  skilled  claims technicians  and  established  case  setting  procedures.  Claims  above  certain  limits  are  referred  to  senior  claims  handlers  for  estimate authorisation.\n\nNo adjustments are made to the claims technicians' case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claims may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case. The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of  standard  actuarial  claims  projection  techniques,  such  as  the  Chain  Ladder  and  Bornhuetter-Ferguson  methods.  Historical  claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification  period  is  also  used  where  this  is  considered appropriate.\n\nThe assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based. Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved. The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.\n\nThe following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves:\n\n## Discounting\n\nOutstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held:\n\n|                                  | Discount rate   | Discount rate   | Mean term of liabilities   | Mean term of liabilities   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Class                            | 2020            | 2019            | 2020                       | 2019                       |\n| Reinsured London Market business | 0.0% to 1.5%    | 0.8% to 2.2%    | 9 years                    | 9 years                    |\n| Latent claims                    | 0.0% to 1.2%    | 0.8% to 2.2%    | 9 to 11 years              | 10 to 12 years             |\n| Structured settlements           | -0.4% to 2.3%   | -0.2% to 2.7%   | 11 to 35 years             | 11 to 35 years             |\n\nThe  period  of  time  which  will  elapse  before  the  liabilities  are  settled  has  been  estimated  by  modelling  the  settlement  patterns  of  the underlying claims.\n\nThe discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves, structured settlements and reinsured London Market business is based on the swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement dates of the claims. The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above. The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 9 and 11 years depending on the geographical region.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately \u00a3130 million (2019: \u00a3120 million) , excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.\n\n## UK mesothelioma claims\n\nThe level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities. UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Group's latent claims. The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees. The best estimate of the liabilities considers the latest available market information and studies and how these might impact Aviva's liabilities.\n\n## Allowance for risk and uncertainty\n\nThe uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions. The reserve estimation basis requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty. The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory. The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.",

These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology for long-term business liabilities (see note 43). They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS. In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates  within  which  a  fair  value  is  likely  to  fall.  The  IASB  deferred  consideration  of  participating  contracts  to  the  IFRS  17  insurance standard, which is expected to apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nFor participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated divisible surplus, except for the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA. Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 45.\n\nInvestment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost. We currently have no non-participating investment contracts measured at amortised cost.\n\nOf the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, \u00a3138,044 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3137,040 million) are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units, plus if required, additional non-unit reserves based on a discounted cash flow analysis. These contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number of units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.\n\nFor unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term. The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 30 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 54.\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts acquired in a business combination, an acquired value of in-force business asset is recognised in respect of the fair value of the investment management services component of the contracts, which is amortised on a systematic basis over the useful lifetime of the related contracts. The amount of the acquired value of in-force business asset is shown in note 18, which relates primarily to the acquisition of Friends Life in 2015 and Friends First in 2018.",

The variance between actual and expected experience in 2020 of \u00a37.0 billion is due to higher bond and gilt values as a result of lower interest rates and increases in US and Japanese equity markets; partially offset by decreases in UK and European equity performance. In addition more UK pension policies have remained in force due to increased pensions freedoms.\n\nThe impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of non-participating investment contract liabilities. The impacts of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 47, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.",

Provision for these guarantees do not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to \u00a376 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a382 million) .\n\n## (ii) Guaranteed unit price on certain products\n\nCertain pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death. No additional  provision  is  made  for  this  guarantee  as  the  investment  management  strategy  for  these  funds  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.\n\n## (iii) Return of premium guarantees\n\nGerman pension products sold in Friends Life between 2006 and 2014 are subject to a return of premium guarantee whereby the product guarantees to return the maximum of the unit fund value or total premiums paid (before deductions). Provisions for this guarantee are calculated using a market-consistent stochastic model and amount to \u00a3223 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3178 million) .\n\n## (b)  UK with-profits business\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits liabilities are evaluated by reference to FRS 27, which was grandfathered under IFRS 4, prior to the adoption of Solvency II. Under the PRA's rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities are measured using market-consistent stochastic models. A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.\n\nThe material guarantees and options relating to this provision are:\n\n## (i) Maturity value and death benefit guarantees\n\nSignificant conventional and unitised with-profits business have minimum maturity (and in some cases death benefit) values reflecting the sum assured plus declared annual bonus. For some unitised with-profits life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in retail price index (RPI) or consumer price index (CPI).\n\n## (ii)  No market valuation reduction (MVR) guarantees\n\nFor  unitised  business,  there  are  circumstances  where  a  'no  MVR'  guarantee  is  applied,  for  example  on  certain  policy  anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.\n\n## (iii) Guaranteed annuity options\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates. The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.\n\nRealistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profits funds were \u00a31,587 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a31,628 million) . With the exception of the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profits funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit. Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA were \u00a3137 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3129 million) .\n\n## (iv) Guaranteed minimum pension\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pension as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.\n\n## (v)  Guaranteed minimum maturity payments on mortgage endowments\n\nThe with-profits funds made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profits mortgage endowments. Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.\n\n## (c)  Ireland\n\n## Guaranteed annuity options and guaranteed maturity values\n\nAs in the UK, the Group's with-profits liabilities in Ireland are measured on a realistic basis, including realistic liabilities for guarantees and options.  Guarantees  and  options  in  Ireland  include  GAOs,  minimum  maturity  values  on  conventional  with-profits  business,  guaranteed minimum bonus rates on unitised with profits business, and a 'no MVR' guarantee that may apply at certain policy anniversaries.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 45 - Financial guarantees and options continued (d)  France\n\n## Guaranteed surrender value guaranteed minimum bonuses and options\n\nAviva France has written a number of contracts with a guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses. The guaranteed surrender  value  is  the  accumulated  value  of  the  contract  including  accrued  bonuses.  Bonuses  are  based  on  accounting  income  from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments. Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values. Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, 'Provision pour Al\u00e9as Financiers' (PAF), when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns. No PAF was established at full year 2020 (2019: no PAF was established) .\n\nThe most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of \u00a338 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a337 billion) . The guaranteed minimum bonus is agreed between Aviva France and the AFER association at the end of each year, in respect of the following year. The bonus was 1.70% for 2020 (2019: 1.85%) compared with an accounting income from the fund of 2.186% (2019: 2.336%) .\n\nNon-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of \u00a311 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a311 billion) and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5% (2019: 0% to 4.5%) . For non-AFER business the accounting income return exceeded guaranteed bonus rates in 2020 (2019: the accounting income return exceeded guaranteed bonus rates) .\n\nIn addition, there are a small proportion of contracts with a switch-loss option. Consistent with previous years, the risks associated with switch-loss options are allowed for in the liabilities in accordance with local regulations and IFRS 4.\n\n## Guaranteed death and maturity benefits\n\nThe Group has also sold a small proportion of unit-linked policies where the death and/or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid. The reserve held in the Group's consolidated statement of financial position is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.\n\n## (e)  Italy\n\n## Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values\n\nThe  Group  has  written  contracts  containing  guaranteed  investment  returns  and  guaranteed  surrender  values  in  Italy.  Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 4% on existing business. New business has a minimum guaranteed return of 0% applicable at certain policy anniversaries. Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations and IFRS 4.\n\n## 46 - Reinsurance assets\n\nThis note details the reinsurance assets on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (a)  Carrying amount\n\nThe reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised:\n\n|                                                 | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Long-term business                              |             |             |\n| Insurance contracts                             | 7,176       | 6,369       |\n| Participating investment contracts              | 1           | 1           |\n| Non-participating investment contracts 1        | 3,860       | 4,006       |\n|                                                 | 11,037      | 10,376      |\n| Outstanding claims provisions                   | 87          | 93          |\n|                                                 | 11,124      | 10,469      |\n| General insurance and health                    |             |             |\n| Outstanding claims provisions                   | 794         | 683         |\n| Provisions for claims incurred but not reported | 1,139       | 1,004       |\n|                                                 | 1,933       | 1,687       |\n| Provisions for unearned premiums                | 299         | 275         |\n|                                                 | 2,232       | 1,962       |\n|                                                 | 13,356      | 12,431      |\n| Less: Assets classified as held for sale        | (18)        | (75)        |\n| Total                                           | 13,338      | 12,356      |\n\nOf the above total, \u00a312,048 million (2019: \u00a310,943 million) is expected to be recovered more than one year after this statement of financial position.\n\n## (b)  Assumptions\n\nThe assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance liabilities.

In addition, there has been a \u00a340 million strengthening of reserves in the UK as a result of COVID-19 partially offset by a \u00a332 million reduction in reserves following a review of recent experience (not related to COVID-19).\n\nThe impact of mortality assumption changes for annuitant contracts on long-term business relates primarily to a reduction in reserves of \u00a3390 million in the UK. This is due to changes in assumptions on both individual and bulk purchase annuities arising from:\n\n- \u221e Updates to base mortality to reflect recent experience of \u00a3224 million;\n- \u221e Updates  to  the  rate  of  mortality  improvements,  including  moving  to  CMI  2019  and  changing  the  long-term  rate  of  future  mortality improvements for males of \u00a3210 million;\n- \u221e Changes to assumptions for anti-selection on individual annuities of \u00a3(68) million;\n- \u221e Net impacts arising from COVID-19 of \u00a324 million.\n\nIn 2019 the impact of mortality for annuitant contracts on long-term business related primarily to a reduction in reserves of \u00a3799 million in the UK comprising:\n\n- \u221e Updates to base mortality to reflect recent experience for individual annuities of \u00a381 million;\n- \u221e Updates to the rate of mortality improvements for individual annuities, including CMI 2018 and a change in smoothing parameter, of \u00a3410 million;\n- \u221e Refinements to modelling of bulk purchase annuities together with a change to base mortality, improvements and a change in smoothing parameter, of \u00a3231 million;\n- \u221e Refinements to modelling of enhanced annuities of \u00a358 million; and\n- \u221e Other less significant movements of \u00a319 million.\n\nIn the general insurance and health business, a negative impact of \u00a3(104) million (2019: \u00a3(54) million negative) has arisen primarily as a result of a decrease in the interest rates used to discount claim reserves for both periodic payment orders (PPOs) and latent claims.",

The movement in UDS is mainly due to market movements in Europe as a result of decreasing interest rates and narrowing credit spreads; partially offset by a decrease in the UK due to an increase in liabilities for special bonus distributions, the disposal of the Singapore business and business now held for sale in Italy.\n\nWhere the aggregate amount of participating assets is less than the participating liabilities within a fund then the shortfall may be held as negative UDS, subject to recoverability testing as part of the liability adequacy requirements of IFRS 4.

The reduction in the value of the provision during 2020 of \u00a3183 million is due to utilisation in the period of \u00a3168 million and a release of \u00a315 million. The issue does not affect any other part of our business. The Group has notified its professional indemnity insurers and intends to make a claim on its insurance to mitigate the financial impact.\n- \u221e The second relates to past communications to a specific sub-set of pension policyholders, that may not have adequately informed them of switching options into with-profit funds that were available to them. This issue is restricted to a product originally sold between 1985 and 1989 and acquired by Aviva through the purchase of Friends Life. It does not affect any other part of our business. We have completed a review to identify affected customers and we will ensure those affected are not disadvantaged. The most significant assumption in relation to the calculation of the provision is the estimated rates of customer switching. Each 10% reduction/increase in the rates of switching would reduce/increase the estimate of the provision by \u00a330 million (2019: \u00a340 million) . The valuation of the provision involves a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty due to the dependence on decisions made by customers, and therefore the possible range of outcomes is significant.\n\n## 51 - Pension obligations\n\n## (a)  Introduction\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, Ireland and Canada. The assets and liabilities of these defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2020 are shown below.\n\n|                                                     | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                     | UK  \u00a3m       | Ireland  \u00a3m  | Canada  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m    | UK  \u00a3m       | Ireland   \u00a3m | Canada   \u00a3m  | Total   \u00a3m   |\n| Total fair value of scheme assets (see b(ii) below) | 18,915       | 941          | 269          | 20,125       | 17,671       | 833          | 264          | 18,768       |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation         | (16,623)     | (1,123)      | (345)        | (18,091)     | (15,416)     | (1,035)      | (341)        | (16,792)     |\n| Net IAS 19 surpluses/(deficits) in the schemes      | 2,292        | (182)        | (76)         | 2,034        | 2,255        | (202)        | (77)         | 1,976        |\n| Surpluses included in other assets (note 31)        | 2,780        | -            | -            | 2,780        | 2,746        | -            | -            | 2,746        |\n| Deficits included in provisions (note 50)           | (488)        | (182)        | (76)         | (746)        | (491)        | (202)        | (77)         | (770)        |\n| Net IAS 19 surpluses/(deficits) in the schemes      | 2,292        | (182)        | (76)         | 2,034        | 2,255        | (202)        | (77)         | 1,976        |\n\nThis note relates to the defined benefit pension schemes included in the table above. There are a number of smaller schemes that are also measured under IAS 19. These are included as a total within Deficits in other staff pension schemes (see note 50). Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section (b)(i) below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section (d) below.\n\nUnder the IAS 19 valuation basis, the Group applies the principles of IFRIC 14, 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction', whereby a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the Company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed. The Group has determined that it can derive economic benefit from the surplus in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme (ASPS) via a reduction to future employer contributions for defined contribution members, which could theoretically be paid from the surplus funds in the ASPS. In the RAC (2003) Pension Scheme and Friends Provident Pension Scheme (FPPS), the Group has determined that the rules set out in the schemes' governing documentation provide for an unconditional right to a refund from any future surplus funds in the schemes.\n\nThe assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees. In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes' beneficiaries. The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.",

Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.\n\nThe number of scheme members was as follows:\n\n|                  | United Kingdom   | United Kingdom   | Ireland       | Ireland       | Canada       | Canada       |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                  | 2020   Number    | 2019   Number    | 2020   Number | 2019   Number | 2020  Number | 2019  Number |\n| Deferred members | 43,698           | 45,748           | 2,458         | 2,479         | 428          | 467          |\n| Pensioners       | 39,447           | 39,038           | 882           | 895           | 1,291        | 1,313        |\n| Total members    | 83,145           | 84,786           | 3,340         | 3,374         | 1,719        | 1,780        |\n\nAll schemes are closed to future accrual. Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with additional future accrual for active members.\n\n## (i) UK schemes\n\nIn the UK, the Group operates three main pension schemes, the ASPS, the RAC Scheme, which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011, and the FPPS, which was acquired as part of the Friends Life acquisition in 2015. As the defined benefit sections of the UK schemes are now closed to both new members and future accrual, existing deferred members in active service and new entrants participate in the defined contribution section of the ASPS. The UK schemes operate within the UK pensions' regulatory framework.\n\n## (ii)  Other schemes\n\nIn Ireland, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Ireland Staff Pension Fund (AISPF) and the Friends First Group Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (FFPS) which was acquired as part of the Friends First acquisition in June 2018. Future accruals for the AISPF and FFPS schemes ceased with effect from 30 April 2013 and 1 April 2014 respectively. The Irish schemes are regulated by the Pensions Authority in Ireland.\n\nThe Canadian defined benefit schemes ceased accruals with effect from 31 December 2011. The main Canadian plan is a Registered Pension Plan in Canada and as such is registered with the Canada Revenue Agency and Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario and is required to comply with the Income Tax Act of Canada and the various provincial Pension Acts within Canada.\n\n## (b)  IAS 19 disclosures\n\nDisclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, Ireland and Canada are given below. Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.\n\n## (i) Movements in the scheme surpluses and deficits\n\nMovements in the pension schemes' surpluses and deficits comprise:\n\n| 2020                                                                    | Fair Value of  Scheme Assets  \u00a3m   | Present Value  of defined  benefit  obligation   \u00a3m   | IAS 19  Pensions net  surplus/  (deficits)   \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Net IAS 19 surplus in the schemes at 1 January                          | 18,768                             | (16,792)                                              | 1,976                                             |\n| Past service costs -

Due to different measurement bases applying for accounting purposes, the premium paid by the scheme exceeded the valuation of the plan asset recognised. This has been recognised as a loss in the actual return on assets within other comprehensive income. The plan asset recognised is transferable and so has not been subject to consolidation within the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe remeasurements recognised are also a result of falling interest rates over the period; as well as an update to the corporate bond portfolio used to derive the discount rate, which reduces the liabilities under IAS 19. The impact of the change in corporate bond portfolio used to derive the discount rate is recognised as a gain from change in financial assumptions within other comprehensive income.\n\n## (ii)  Scheme assets\n\nScheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2020.\n\nTotal scheme assets are comprised by country as follows:\n\n|                                                                                | 2020    | 2020         | 2020        | 2020       | 2020    | 2019         | 2019        | 2019       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------|\n|                                                                                | UK   \u00a3m | Ireland   \u00a3m | Canada   \u00a3m | Total   \u00a3m | UK   \u00a3m | Ireland   \u00a3m | Canada   \u00a3m | Total   \u00a3m |\n| Bonds                                                                          | 19,702  | 921          | 119         | 20,742     | 17,343  | 723          | 141         | 18,207     |\n| Equities                                                                       | -       | 31           | -           | 31         | -       | -            | -           | -          |\n| Property                                                                       | 352     | -            | -           | 352        | 392     | -            | -           | 392        |\n| Pooled investment vehicles                                                     | 4,182   | 272          | 146         | 4,600      | 4,497   | 283          | 122         | 4,902      |\n| Derivatives                                                                    | -       | 13           | -           | 13         | 60      | 4            | -           | 64         |\n| Insurance Policies                                                             | 2,714   | -            | -           | 2,714      | 1,977   | -            | -           | 1,977      |\n| Cash and other 1                                                               | (7,368) | (296)        | 4           | (7,660)    | (5,952) | (177)        | 1           | (6,128)    |\n| Total fair value of scheme assets                                              | 19,582  | 941          | 269         | 20,792     | 18,317  | 833          | 264         | 19,414     |\n| Less: consolidation elimination for non-transferable Group  insurance policy 2 | (667)   | -            | -           | (667)      | (646)   | -            | -           | (646)      |\n| Total IAS 19 fair value of scheme assets                                       | 18,915  | 941          | 269         | 20,125     | 17,671  | 833          | 264         | 18,768     |",

Where the investments are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in 'Cash and other'. There are no significant judgements involved in the valuation of the scheme assets. Insurance policies are valued on the same basis as the pension scheme liabilities, as required by IAS 19.\n\n## (iii) Assumptions on scheme liabilities\n\nThe valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent funding actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the standard's requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2020.\n\n## The projected unit credit method\n\nThe inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis. This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method. This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings. It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe main financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are:\n\n|                              |                                                                    | UK                                                        |                          | Ireland   |                          | Canada                   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                              | 2020                                                               | 2019                                                      | 2020                     | 2019      | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Inflation rate 1             | 3.0%/2.4%                                                          | 3.0%/2.2%                                                 | 1.4%                     | 1.5%      | 2.0%                     | 2.0%                     |\n| General salary increases 2   | 4.75%                                                              | 4.8%                                                      | 2.9%                     | 3.0%      | 2.5%                     | 2.5%                     |\n| Pension increases 3          | 3.0%/2.4%                                                          | 3.0%/2.2%                                                 | 0.3%                     | 0.35%     | 1.25%                    | 1.25%                    |\n| Deferred pension increases 3 | 3.0%/2.4%                                                          | 3.0%/2.2%                                                 | 1.4%                     | 1.5%      | -                        | -                        |\n| Discount rate 4,5            | 1.31%/1.37% (non-insured  members)  1.34%/1.22% (insured  members) | 1.9% (non-insured  members)  1.9%/1.8% (insured  members) | 0.75%/0.85%              | 1.1%/1.2% | 2.375%                   | 3.00%                    |\n| Basis of discount rate       |                                                                    | AA-rated corporate bonds                                  | AA-rated corporate bonds |           | AA-rated corporate bonds | AA-rated corporate bonds |\n\nThe discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate. For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of highquality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.",

The tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience. However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption. For the ASPS, which is the most material scheme to the Group, the allowance for mortality improvement is per the actuarial profession's 'CMI\\_2019 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments' model (2019: 'CMI\\_2018 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments') , with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% per annum (2019: 1.75% per annum) for males and 1.5% per annum (2019: 1.5% per annum) for females. The CMI\\_2019 tables have been adjusted by adding 0.25% per annum (2019: 0.25% per annum) and 0.35% per annum (2019: 0.35% per annum) to the initial rate of mortality improvements for males and females respectively (to allow for greater mortality improvements in the pension scheme membership relative to the general population on which CMI\\_2019 is based), and uses the advanced parameters to taper the longterm improvement rates to zero between ages 90 and 115 (2019: long-term improvement rates taper to zero between ages 90 and 115) (the 'core' parameters taper the long-term improvement rates to zero between ages 85 and 110).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSignificant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined by changing the respective assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant. The following table summarises how the defined benefit obligation would have increased/(decreased) as a result of the change in the respective assumptions:\n\n## Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation\n\n|                                                                           | Increase in  discount rate  +1%   \u00a3m   | Decrease in  discount rate   -1%   \u00a3m   | Increase in  inflation rate  +1%   \u00a3m   | Decrease in  inflation rate   -1%   \u00a3m   |   1 year   younger 1 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2020 | (2,976)                                | 3,950                                   | 2,647                                   | (2,067)                                  |                     714 |\n| Impact on present value of defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2019 | (2,786)                                | 3,713                                   | 2,627                                   | (2,037)                                  |                     613 |\n\nIt is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. In addition, the sensitivities shown are for liabilities only and ignore the impact on assets, which would significantly mitigate the net interest rate and inflation sensitivity impact on the net surplus, as well as the longevity sensitivity impact due to the insurance policy and longevity swap assets held by the UK schemes.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 51 - Pension obligations continued\n\n## Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation\n\n## (b)  IAS 19 disclosures continued\n\nThe discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 19 years in ASPS, 21 years in FPPS, 19 years in the RAC scheme, 19 years in AISPF, 28 years in FFPS and 11 years in the Canadian scheme. The expected undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme, ASPS, is shown in the chart below:\n\n## Undiscounted benefit payments (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iv) Risk management and asset allocation strategy\n\nAs noted above, the investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes. To meet these objectives, the schemes' assets are invested in a portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities as detailed in section (b)(ii). The investment strategy will continue to evolve over time and is expected to match the liability profile increasingly closely with swap overlays to improve interest rate and inflation matching. The schemes are generally matched to interest rate risk relative to the funding bases.\n\n## Main UK scheme\n\nThe Company works closely with the trustee, who is required to consult with the Company on the investment strategy.\n\nInterest rate and inflation rate risks are managed using a combination of liability-matching assets and swaps. Exposure to equity risk has reduced over time and credit risk is managed within risk appetite. Currency risk is relatively small and is largely hedged. The other principal risk  is  longevity  risk.  This  risk  has  reduced  due  to  the  ASPS  entering  into  a  longevity  swap  in  2014  covering  approximately  \u00a35  billion  of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.\n\nIn October 2019 the ASPS completed a bulk annuity buy-in transaction with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, a Group Company. This covered approximately \u00a31.1 billion of liabilities related to deferred pensioners and current pensioners, removing the investment and longevity risk for these members from the scheme. A further buy-in transaction with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited took place in October 2020, and covered approximately \u00a30.6 billion of liabilities relating to deferred pensioners and current pensioners.\n\n## Other schemes\n\nThe other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme. In 2015, the RAC pension scheme entered into a longevity swap covering approximately \u00a30.6 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.\n\n## (v)  Funding\n\nFormal actuarial valuations normally take place every three years and where there is a deficit, the Group and the trustees would agree a deficit recovery plan. The assumptions adopted for triennial actuarial valuations are determined by the trustees and agreed with the Group and are normally more prudent than the assumptions adopted for IAS19 purposes, which are best estimate.\n\nFor the ASPS, following the latest formal actuarial valuation (with an effective date of 31 March 2018) a schedule of contributions was agreed with the trustees, even though the ASPS was fully funded on its technical provisions basis consistent with the requirements of the UK pension regulations.\n\nTotal employer contributions for all defined benefit schemes in 2021 are currently expected to be \u00a30.2 billion.\n\n## (c)  Defined contribution (money purchase) section of the ASPS\n\nThe trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds. Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their risk appetite and their retirement plans. Members of this section contribute at least 2% of their pensionable salaries, and depending on the percentage chosen, the Group contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits. These contribution rates remained unchanged until June 2017. From 1 July 2017, for every 1% additional employee contribution, the Group will contribute an additional 0.1% employer contribution. The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution schemes is shown in section (d) below.",

Where subordinated debt is undated or loan notes are perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years. Annual interest payments in future years for these borrowings are \u00a349 million (2019: \u00a349 million) .\n\nContractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable.

These loan notes are carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium and are therefore classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy. The risk allowances are consistent with those used in the fair value asset methodology, as described in note 24. These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.\n\nThe securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.

The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment of interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the relevant Property Fund and they have  no  recourse  whatsoever  to  the  policyholder  or  shareholders'  funds  of  any  companies  in  the  Group.  Loans  of  \u00a322  million (2019: \u00a364 million) included in the table above relate to Property Funds.\n\nOther non-recourse loans primarily include external debt raised by special purpose vehicles in the UK long-term business. The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the shareholders' funds of any companies in the Group. The outstanding balance of these loans at 31 December 2020 was \u00a352 million (2019: \u00a352 million) .\n\nOther loans of \u00a3234 million (2019: \u00a3222 million) include external debt raised by overseas long-term businesses to fund operations.\n\n## (v)  Securitised mortgage loan notes\n\nLoan notes have been issued by special purpose securitisation companies in the UK.

These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes. However, the actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ, for example because experience may be worse than that assumed, or future general insurance business claims inflation may differ from that expected, and hence there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.\n\nIn addition, COVID-19 has given rise to an increase in the uncertainty over the general insurance business outstanding claims provisions and long-term business provisions. The impact on the Group's insurance liabilities as a result of the global pandemic has been recognised (see note 47 for long-term business and note 42(c(iv)) for general insurance and health business). However, due to the uncertainty around the long-term impacts of COVID-19, actual experience may differ from that expected.\n\n## Business Interruption\n\nOn 15 January 2021, the Supreme Court handed down its judgement on the appeal for the FCA Test Case on business interruption cover. Aviva was not a party to the Test Case, but fully supported the process. The Supreme Court judgement has been carefully considered and the impact on claims related to business interruption policies assessed. In Canada, we are party to a number of litigation proceedings challenging coverage under certain policies; however, we do not believe there is coverage under these policies. In the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been established for such claims based on information available at the reporting date. For further information on our general insurance risk management see note 59(f).\n\n## (b)  Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards\n\nIn the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards. Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including Europe, Canada and Australia. Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty. However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims and substantial reinsurance cover now in place, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.\n\n## (c)  Guarantees on long-term savings products\n\nAs a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and investment products. Note 45 gives details of these guarantees and options. In providing these guarantees and options, the Group's capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates,  interest  rates,  property  values  and  equity  prices.  Interest  rate  guaranteed  returns,  such  as  those  available  on  guaranteed  annuity options, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level. Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made. The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 55 - Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued (d)  Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Group's insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates. A number of the Group's  UK  subsidiaries  are  dual  regulated  (directly  authorised  by  both  the  PRA  (for  prudential  regulation)  and  the  FCA  (for  conduct regulation)) while others are solo regulated (regulated solely by the FCA for both prudential and conduct regulation). Between them, the PRA and FCA have broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firm's authorisation; to investigate marketing and sales practices; and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources. The Group's regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers, but in some cases they also operate a system of 'prior product approval'.\n\nThe Group's regulated businesses have compliance resources to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way and take corrective action when warranted. However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.\n\nThe impact of any such finding (whether in the UK or overseas) could have a negative impact on the Group's reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers. Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results, operations and/or financial condition and divert management's attention from the day-to-day management of the business.\n\n## (e)  Structured settlements\n\nThe Group has purchased annuities from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants. As a result of these arrangements, the Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for these types of arrangements is approximately \u00a3742 million as at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3707 million) . Credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability. This risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the Canadian life insurance industry compensation plan. As at 31 December 2020, no information has come to  the  Group's  attention  that  would  suggest  any  weakness  or  failure  in  life  insurers  from  which  it  has  purchased  annuities  and consequently no provision for credit risk is required.\n\n## (f) Other\n\nIn the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation. In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.\n\nIn  addition,  in  line  with  standard  business  practice,  various  Group  companies  have  given  guarantees,  indemnities  and  warranties  in connection with disposals of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group. In the opinion of the directors, no material unprovisioned loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.\n\nThere are a number of charges registered over the assets of Group companies in favour of other Group companies or third parties. In addition, certain of the Company's assets are charged in favour of certain of its subsidiaries as security for intra-Group loans.\n\n## 56 - Capital commitments\n\nThis note gives details of our commitments to capital expenditure. See note 23 for further information on lease commitments.\n\nContractual commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures of infrastructure loans, equity funds, investment property and property and equipment, which have not been recognised in the financial statements, are as follows:\n\n|                              | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Infrastructure loan advances | 833         | 853         |\n| Investment property          | 167         | 115         |\n| Property and equipment       | 46          | 62          |\n| Other investment vehicles 1  | 123         | 241         |\n|                              | 1,169       | 1,271       |\n\nNotes 19 and 20 set out the commitments the Group has to its joint ventures and associates.\n\n## 57 - Group capital management\n\n## (a)  Group capital\n\nThe  Group  is  required  to  measure  and  monitor  its  capital  resources  on  a  regulatory  basis  and  to  comply  with  the  minimum  capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates. At a Group level, we have to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA under the transitional approach to the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.\n\nThe Group Solvency II capital requirements are calculated using a Partial Internal Model (PIM) which assesses the risks the Group is exposed to on an Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The Solvency II capital regime requires insurers to calculate regulatory capital adequacy at both individual regulated subsidiaries and an aggregate Group level. Non-EEA entities have been included in Group solvency in line with Solvency II requirements. Other financial sector entities (including fund management) are included at their proportional share of the capital requirement according to the relevant sectoral values. In addition, non-EEA businesses including Canada are subject to the locally applicable capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nGroup capital continues to be represented by Solvency II own funds. The Solvency II position disclosed is based on a 'shareholder view'. The shareholder view is considered by management to be more representative of the shareholders' risk exposure and the Group's ability to cover the solvency capital requirement (SCR) with eligible own funds and aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 57 - Group capital management continued\n\n## (a)  Group capital continued\n\nIn arriving at the shareholder position, the following adjustments are typically made to the regulatory Solvency II own funds:\n\n- \u221e The contribution to the Group's SCR and own funds of the most material fully ring fenced with-profits funds of \u00a32,492 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a32,501 million) and staff pension schemes in surplus of \u00a31,179 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a31,181 million) are excluded. These exclusions have no impact on Solvency II surplus as these funds are self-supporting on a Solvency II capital basis with any surplus capital above SCR not recognised;\n- \u221e A notional reset of the transitional measure on technical provisions (TMTP), calculated using the same method as used for formal TMTP resets. This presentation avoids step changes to the Solvency II position that arise only when the formal TMTP reset points are triggered. The 31 December 2020 Solvency II position includes a notional reset (\u00a3564 million increase in surplus) while the 31 December 2019 Solvency II position included a formal, rather than notional, reset of the TMTP in line with the regulatory requirement to reset the TMTP at least every two years and hence no adjustment was required; and\n- \u221e A  change  in  regulations  announced  in  December  2019  allows  French  insurers  to  place  a  part  of  the  Provision  pour  Participation  aux Exc\u00e9dents (PPE) into Solvency II own funds. At 31 December 2019 PPE was included in the France local regulatory own funds but was excluded from the estimated Group regulatory and shareholder own funds, subject to confirmation of the appropriate treatment at Group level. The treatment has since been confirmed and PPE of \u00a3385 million is included within Group regulatory own funds at 31 December 2020 but remains excluded from the shareholder position.\n\n|                                                              | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Estimated Solvency II regulatory own funds as at 31 December | 29,262     | 28,347     |\n| Adjustments for:                                             |            |            |\n| Fully ring-fenced with-profits funds                         | (2,492)    | (2,501)    |\n| Staff pension schemes in surplus                             | (1,179)    | (1,181)    |\n| Notional reset of TMTP                                       | 564        | -          |\n| PPE                                                          | (385)      | -          |\n| Pro forma adjustments 1                                      | -          | (117)      |\n| Estimated Solvency II shareholder own funds at 31 December   | 25,770     | 24,548     |\n\nSolvency  II  own  funds  are  comprised  of  a  combination  of  shareholders'  funds,  preference  share  capital,  direct  capital  instruments, subordinated debt, and deferred tax assets measured on a Solvency II basis. During the year, the Group redeemed its \u00a3500 million 5.9021% direct capital instrument in full (see note 37).\n\nSolvency II surplus at the Group level represents the excess of eligible Solvency II own funds over the Group's solvency capital requirements calculated in accordance with Solvency II requirements. The Group maintained capital in excess of the SCR at all times during 2020. All regulated subsidiaries complied with their capital requirements throughout the year.\n\nFurther information on the Group's Solvency II position (shareholder view), including a reconciliation between IFRS equity and own funds can be found in the Other information section. This information is estimated and is therefore subject to change. It is also unaudited.\n\n## (b)  Risks and capital management objectives\n\nThe primary objective of capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure, in a manner consistent with our risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business. Capital is a primary consideration across a wide range of business activities, including product  development,  pricing,  business  planning,  merger  and  acquisition  transactions  and  asset  and  liability  management.  A  Capital Management Standard, applicable Group-wide, sets out minimum standards and guidelines over responsibility for capital management including considerations for capital management decisions and requirements for management information, capital monitoring, reporting, forecasting, planning and overall governance.\n\nThe Group manages capital in conjunction with solvency capital requirements and in line with a new dividend policy and capital framework announced in November 2020.\n\nThe Group seeks to, on a consistent basis:\n\n- \u221e Maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength in accordance with risk appetite, to support new business growth and satisfy the requirements of our regulators and other stakeholders giving both our customers and shareholders assurance of our financial strength. See note 59 for more information about the Group's risk management approach;\n- \u221e Retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity, access to a range of capital markets and significant unutilised committed credit lines;\n- \u221e Manage an appropriate level of leverage to ensure an efficient capital structure;\n- \u221e Allocate capital rigorously to support value adding growth and return excess capital to shareholders where appropriate; and\n- \u221e Operate a sustainable dividend policy with a level of dividend that is resilient in times of stress and is covered by the capital and cash generated from the core markets of UK, Ireland and Canada.",

We accept the risks inherent to our core business lines of life, health and general insurance and asset management. We diversify these risks through our scale, geographic spread, the variety of the products and services we offer and the channels through which we sell them. We receive premiums which we invest to maximise risk-adjusted returns, so that we can fulfil our promises to customers while providing a return to our shareholders. In doing so we have a preference for retaining those risks we believe we are capable of managing to generate a return.\n\nOur sustainability and financial strength are underpinned by an effective risk management process which helps us identify major risks to which we may be exposed, establish appropriate controls and take mitigating actions for the benefit of our customers and investors. The Group's risk strategy is to invest its available capital to optimise the balance between return and risk while maintaining an appropriate level of economic (i.e. risk-based) capital and regulatory capital.\n\nThe key elements of our risk  management framework comprise our risk appetite; risk governance, including risk  policies  and  business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities; and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing.\n\nThe Group's overarching risk management and internal control system is actively responding to the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and remains intact. We are focused on ensuring that the control environment remains robust in the current operating environment.\n\n## Risk environment\n\nDuring the year, the Group has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through its operations, insurance products and asset holdings as well as ongoing difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally. General insurance products are impacted as a result of disruption to business and travel insured by the Group; life protection products as a result of increased mortality; savings and asset management revenues which are sensitive to asset values; and income protection, critical illness and health insurance products as a result of increased morbidity, offset by a potential reduction in annuity payments.\n\nWe have seen COVID-19 have a significant impact on the global economy and markets. Key impacts have been observed from volatile equity markets and falls in interest rates. We have taken a number of actions to reduce our exposure to equity and interest rate risk across all our markets. We have also taken a number of actions to reduce our exposure to credit spread and counterparty default risk across our major markets. The Group's balance sheet exposure has been reviewed and actions are being taken to further reduce the sensitivity to economic shocks.\n\nThe Group continues to maintain strong solvency and liquidity positions through a range of scenarios and stress testing. These scenarios allow for the potential impacts of COVID-19 both directly on operations of the Group and also the wider macroeconomic environment. Key financial actions taken in response to the crisis include significant de-risking to reduce sensitivity to equity and corporate credit spreads. We have been closely engaging with regulators in both Europe and globally on their response to COVID-19. The FCA Business Interruption test case judgement was broadly in line with expectations and reserves are not expected to materially change.",

An increase in switching, churning and exaggerated or fraudulent GI claims is expected, particularly if the economic impact is prolonged. Our controls have been effectively monitoring this situation.\n\nIn the current climate, areas of increased conduct risk have been identified across the Group in relation to the financial vulnerability of our customers, product suitability and fair value. In response, our businesses have taken action to support the needs of different customer groups and we continue to work with local regulators. Steps have been taken to support our customers and their local communities, whether that be through extension of covers, additional support to customers and charitable donations.\n\nThe UK-EU Future Relationship Agreement came into effect on 1 January 2021, ending the Brexit transition period, for which the Group was fully  prepared.  It  provides  scope  for  managed  policy  divergence  or  maintaining  alignment,  if  the  UK  chooses.  The  agreement  will  have evolving consequences in 2021 and beyond on future financial services and data regulation, UK-EU data transfers, EU market access and the UK economy which will require careful monitoring.\n\nAviva remains committed to supporting a low carbon economy that will improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement target on climate change. We are acting now to mitigate and manage the impact of climate change on our business. We calculate a Climate VaR against IPCC scenarios to assess the climate-related risks and opportunities under different emission projections and associated temperature pathways. A range of different financial indicators are used to assess the impact on our investments and insurance liabilities.\n\nThe Group is in the process of implementing the new international accounting standards for insurance contracts, IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 significantly impacts the measurement and presentation of the contracts in scope of the standard. It is now expected that the standard will apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\n## (a)  Risk management framework\n\nFor the purposes of risk identification and measurement, and aligned to Aviva's risk policies, risks are usually grouped by risk type: credit, market,  liquidity,  life  insurance  (including  long-term  health),  general  insurance  (including  short-term  health),  asset  management  and operational risk. Risks falling within these types may affect a number of metrics including those relating to balance sheet strength, liquidity and  profit.  They  may  also  affect  the  performance  of  the  products  we  deliver  to  our  customers  and  the  service  to  our  customers  and distributors, which can be categorised as risks to our brand and reputation or as conduct risk.\n\nTo  promote a  consistent  and  rigorous  approach  to  risk  management  across  all  businesses  we  have  a  set  of  risk  policies  and  business standards  which  set  out  the  risk  strategy,  appetite,  framework  and  minimum  requirements  for  the  Group's  worldwide  operations.  The business Chief Executive Officers make an annual declaration supported by an opinion from the business Chief Risk Officers that the system of governance and internal controls was effective and fit for purpose for their business throughout the year.\n\nA regular top-down key risk identification and assessment process is carried out by the risk function. This includes the consideration of emerging risks  and  is  supported  by  deeper  thematic  reviews.  This  process  is  replicated  at  the  business  unit  level.  The  risk  assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.\n\nRisk models are an important tool in our measurement of risks and are used to support the monitoring and reporting of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available. We carry out a range of stress (where one risk factor, such as equity returns, is assumed to vary) and scenario (where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary) tests to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged. For those risk types managed through the holding of capital, being our principal risk types except for liquidity risk, we measure and monitor our risk profile on the basis of the Solvency II SCR.\n\nRoles and responsibilities for risk management in Aviva are based around the 'three lines of defence model' where ownership for risk is taken at all levels in the Group. Line management in the business is accountable for risk management, including the implementation of the risk management framework and embedding of the risk culture. The risk function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge  of  the  risk  identification,  measurement,  monitoring,  management  and  reporting  processes  and  for  developing  the  risk management framework. Internal Audit provides an independent assessment of the risk framework and internal control processes.\n\nBoard oversight of risk and risk management across the Group is maintained on a regular basis through its Risk Committee and Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee. To further align with our strategic priority to transform customer experiences, the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee was designated as a sub-committee of the Risk Committee. The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take. Risk appetites are set relative to capital and liquidity at Group and in the business units.\n\nThe risk management framework of a small number of our joint ventures and strategic equity holdings differs from the Aviva framework outlined in this note. We work with these entities to understand how their risks are managed and to align them, where possible, with Aviva's framework.\n\nThe types of risks to which the Group is exposed have not changed significantly during the year and remain credit, market, liquidity, life and health insurance, general insurance, asset management and operational risks. These risks are described below.\n\n## (b)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to Aviva, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks. Credit risk is taken so that we can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders. In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, due to the better expected risk adjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 59 - Risk management continued\n\n## (b)  Credit risk continued\n\nOur approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements. Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security  investments,  structured  asset  investments,  bank  deposits,  derivative  counterparties,  mortgage  lending  and  reinsurance counterparties.\n\nThe Group manages its credit risk at business unit and Group level. All business units are required to implement credit risk management processes (including limits frameworks), operate specific risk management committees, and ensure detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria. At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate a Group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.\n\nAs a result of the financial market impact of COVID-19 we have taken a number of actions to reduce our exposure to credit spread and counterparty default risk across our major markets. Actions include purchasing tactical derivative hedges, asset disposals and reallocation and reducing new business sales in certain markets and products. We continue to monitor credit quality in our Commercial Mortgage and Equity Release Mortgage portfolios, specific de-risking actions include phased sales and credit hedging.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the Group's current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.\n\n## (i) Financial exposures by credit ratings\n\nFinancial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued. AAA is the highest possible rating. Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.

The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking collateral or these hedges into account, is represented by the carrying value of the financial instruments  in  the  statement  of  financial  position.  These  comprise  debt  securities,  reinsurance  assets,  derivative  assets,  loans  and receivables. The carrying values of these assets are disclosed in the relevant notes: financial investments (note 28), reinsurance assets (note 46), loans (note 25) and receivables (note 29). The collateral in place for these credit exposures is disclosed in note 61.\n\n## (ii)  Other investments\n\nOther investments (including assets of operations classified as held for sale) include: unit trusts and other investment vehicles; derivative financial instruments, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements; and other assets, including deposits with credit institutions and minority holdings in property management undertakings.\n\nThe  credit  quality  of  the  underlying  debt  securities  within  investment  vehicles  is  managed  by  the  safeguards  built  into  the  investment mandates for these funds which determine the funds' risk profiles. At the Group level, we also monitor the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles against Group set limits.\n\nA proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable. Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall appetite for market risk.\n\n## (iii) Loans\n\nThe Group loan portfolio principally comprises:\n\n- \u221e Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy;\n- \u221e Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions. These loans are fully collateralised by other securities;\n- \u221e Healthcare, infrastructure and PFI loans secured against healthcare, education, social housing and emergency services related premises; and\n- \u221e Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.\n\nWe use loan to value, interest and debt service cover, and diversity and quality of the tenant base metrics to internally monitor our exposures to  mortgage loans. We use credit quality, based on dynamic market measures, and collateralisation rules to manage our stock lending activities.\n\n## (iv) Credit concentration risk\n\nThe long-term and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations applicable in most markets and the Group's credit policy and limits framework, which limit investments in individual assets and asset classes. Credit concentrations are monitored as part of the regular credit monitoring process and are reported to the Group Asset Liability  Committee (ALCO). With the exception of government bonds, the largest aggregated counterparty exposure within shareholder assets is to the Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (including subsidiaries), representing approximately 2.1% of the total shareholder assets.\n\n## (v)  Reinsurance credit exposures\n\nThe Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings. The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer. Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite. The Group Capital and Group Risk teams have an active monitoring role with escalation to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Group ALCO and the Board Risk Committee as appropriate.\n\nThe  Group's  largest  reinsurance  counterparty  is  Swiss  Reinsurance  Company  Ltd  (including  subsidiaries).  At  31  December  2020,  the reinsurance asset recoverable, including debtor balances, from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd was \u00a32,399 million (2019: \u00a33,097 million) .\n\n## (vi) Securities finance\n\nThe Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK and smaller operations in some other businesses. The risks within this activity are mitigated by collateralisation and minimum counterparty credit quality requirements.\n\n## (vii)  Derivative credit exposures\n\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades. This risk is generally mitigated through holding collateral for most trades. Residual exposures are captured within the Group's credit management framework.\n\n## (viii) Unit-linked business\n\nIn  unit-linked  business  the  policyholder  bears  the  direct  market  risk  and  credit  risk  on  investment  assets  in  the  unit  funds  and  the shareholders' exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent of the income arising from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.",

There were no material financial assets included in the tables that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.\n\n## (c)  Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse financial impact resulting, directly or indirectly from fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices. Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held. At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders. We actively seek some market risks as part of our investment and product strategy. However, we have limited appetite for interest rate risk as we do not believe it is adequately rewarded.\n\nThe management of market risk is undertaken at business unit and at Group level. Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints. Group Capital is responsible for monitoring and managing market risk at the Group level and has established criteria for matching assets and liabilities to limit the impact of mismatches due to market movements.\n\nIn  addition,  where  the  Group's  long-term  savings  businesses  have  written  insurance  and  investment  products  where  the  majority  of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders' risk and reward objectives. The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations. The shareholders' exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.\n\nAs a result of the significant financial market impact of COVID-19, particularly to equity markets and interest rates, we have taken a number of actions to reduce our exposure to equity and interest rate risk across all our markets. Actions include purchasing tactical derivative hedges, asset disposals and reallocations and reducing new business sales in certain markets and products. We are also exposed to the potential impact of increased defaults and downgrades on our commercial mortgage loans although we maintain conservative loan-to-value across this portfolio. Our capital position includes an allowance for the expected potential impacts from downgrades and defaults.\n\nThe most material types of market risk that the Group is exposed to are described below.\n\n## (i) Equity price risk\n\nThe Group is subject to direct equity price risk arising from changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio. Our most material indirect equity price risk exposures are to policyholder unit-linked funds, which are exposed to a fall in the value of the fund thereby reducing the fees we earn on those funds, and participating contracts, which are exposed to a fall in the value of the funds thereby increasing our costs for  policyholder  guarantees.  We  also  have  some  equity  exposure  in  shareholder  funds  through  equities  held  to  match  inflation-linked liabilities.\n\nWe continue to limit our direct equity exposure in line with our risk preferences. At a business unit level, investment limits and local investment regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities. The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.",

Businesses  actively  model  the performance of equities through the use of risk models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates. An equity hedging strategy remains in place to help control the Group's overall direct and indirect exposure to equities. At 31 December 2020 the Group continues to hold a series of macro equity hedges to reduce the overall shareholder equity risk exposure.\n\nSensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section (i) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (ii)  Property price risk\n\nThe Group is subject to property price risk directly due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide and indirectly through investments in mortgages and mortgage backed securities. Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and is subject to local regulations on investments, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices. Exposure to property risk on equity release mortgages from sustained underperformance in the UK House Price Index (HPI) is mitigated by capping loan to value on origination at low levels and regularly monitoring the performance of the mortgage portfolio.\n\nSensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section (i) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from the Group's investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities. A number of policyholder product features have an influence on the Group's interest rate risk. The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values. Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 45.\n\nExposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing. The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is considered within our scenario testing.\n\nThe Group typically manages interest rate risk by investing in fixed interest securities which closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities where such investments are available. In particular, a key objective is to at least match the duration of our annuity liabilities with assets of the same duration, and in some cases where appropriate cash flow matching has been used. These assets include corporate bonds, residential mortgages and commercial mortgages. Should they default before maturity, it is assumed that the Group can reinvest in assets of a similar risk and return profile, which is subject to market conditions. Interest rate risk is also managed in some business units using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors.\n\nSome of the Group's products, principally participating contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will impact on profits through a change in the interest spread (the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the investment  income  we  are  able  to  earn  on  the  investments  supporting  our  obligations  under  those  contracts).  Markets  where  Aviva  is primarily exposed to this risk are the UK, France, Italy and some other Asian business units.\n\nThe low interest rate environment in a number of markets around the world has resulted in our current investment yields being lower than the overall current portfolio yield, primarily in our investments in fixed income securities. We anticipate that interest rates may remain below historical averages for an extended period of time and that financial markets may continue to have periods of high volatility. Investing activity will  continue to decrease the portfolio yield as long as market yields remain below the current portfolio level. We expect the decline in portfolio yield will result in lower net investment income in future periods.\n\nOther product lines of the Group, such as protection, are not significantly sensitive to interest rate or market movements. For unit-linked business, the shareholder margins emerging are typically a mixture of annual management fees and risk/expense charges. Risk and expense margins will be largely unaffected by low interest rates. Annual management fees may increase in the short term as the move towards low interest rates increases the value of unit funds. However, in the medium term, unit funds will grow at a lower rate which will reduce fund charges. For the UK annuities business, interest rate exposure is mitigated by closely matching the duration of liabilities with assets of the same duration.\n\nThe  UK  participating  business  includes  contracts  with  features  such  as  guaranteed  surrender  values,  guaranteed  annuity  options,  and minimum surrender and maturity values. These liabilities are managed through duration matching of assets and liabilities and the use of derivatives, including swaptions. As a result, the Group's exposure to sustained low interest rates on this portfolio is not material. The Group's key exposure to low interest rates arises through its other participating contracts, principally in Italy and France. Some of these contracts also include features such as guaranteed minimum bonuses, guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values. In a low interest rate environment there is a risk that the yield on assets might not be sufficient to cover these obligations. For certain of its participating contracts the Group is able to amend guaranteed crediting rates. Our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by competition, bonus mechanisms and contractual arrangements.",

The asset portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities. The portfolio investment yield and average total invested assets in our general insurance and health business are set out in the table below.\n\n|      | Portfolio  investment  yield 1   | Average   assets   \u00a3m   |\n|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2018 | 2.28%                            | 14,651                  |\n| 2019 | 2.21%                            | 14,350                  |\n| 2020 | 1.88%                            | 15,023                  |\n\nThe nature of the business means that prices in certain circumstances can be increased to maintain overall profitability. This is subject to the competitive environment in each market. To the extent that there are further falls in interest rates the investment yield would be expected to decrease further in future periods.\n\nSensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section (i) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (iv) Inflation risk\n\nInflation risk arises primarily from the Group's exposure to general insurance claims inflation, to inflation linked benefits within the defined benefit staff pension schemes and within the UK annuity portfolio and to expense inflation. Increases in long-term inflation expectations are closely linked to long-term interest rates and so are frequently considered with interest rate risk. Exposure to inflation risk is monitored through  capital  modelling,  sensitivity  testing  and  stress  and  scenario  testing.  The  Group  typically  manages  inflation  risk  through  its investment strategy and, in particular, by investing in inflation linked securities and through a variety of derivative instruments, including inflation linked swaps.\n\n## (v)  Currency risk\n\nThe Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profits contract liabilities or are hedged. As a result the foreign exchange gains and losses on investments are largely offset by changes in unit-linked and with-profits liabilities and fair value changes in derivatives attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. Approximately 50% ( 2019: 58% ) of the Group's premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Group's net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are sterling, euro and Canadian dollars. The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements. However, the Group does use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge planned dividends from its subsidiaries.\n\nBusinesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the Group's consolidated shareholders' equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set. Except where the Group has applied net investment hedge accounting (see note 60(a)), foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency borrowings are recognised in the income statement, whereas foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income. At 31 December 2020 and 2019, the Group's net assets by currency including assets 'held for sale' was:\n\n|                                | Sterling   \u00a3m   | Euro   \u00a3m   |   CAD$   \u00a3m | Other   \u00a3m   | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Net assets at 31 December 2020 | 16,438          | 2,374       |         635 | 1,113        | 20,560       |\n| Net assets at 31 December 2019 | 16,036          | 819         |         397 | 1,433        | 18,685       |",

Derivatives  are  primarily  used  for  efficient  investment  management,  risk  hedging purposes, or to structure specific retail savings products. Activity is overseen by the Group Capital and Group Risk teams, which monitor exposure levels and approve large or complex transactions.\n\nThe Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.\n\n## (vii) Correlation risk\n\nThe Group recognises that lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates. These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the internal capital model and in scenario analysis.\n\n## (d)  Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. The relatively illiquid nature of insurance liabilities is a potential source of additional investment return by allowing us to invest in higher yielding, but less liquid assets such as commercial mortgages and infrastructure loans. The Group seeks to ensure that it maintains sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due through the application of a Group liquidity risk policy and business standard and through the development of its liquidity risk management plan. At Group and business unit level, there is a liquidity risk appetite which requires that sufficient liquid resources be maintained to cover net outflows in a stress scenario. In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Group maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities (\u00a31,700 million) from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.\n\nA cautious approach on cash remittances is being taken across the Group with some markets retaining cash rather than remitting to Group in the wake of the unprecedented challenges COVID-19 presents for businesses, households and customers, and the adverse and highly uncertain impact on the global economy.\n\n## Maturity analyses\n\nThe following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance assets held to meet them. A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and non-hedge derivatives is given in notes 52 and 60, respectively. Contractual obligations under leases and capital commitments are given in note 23 and note 56.\n\n## (i) Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities\n\nFor  non-linked  insurance  business,  the  following  table  shows  the  gross  liability  at  31  December  2020  and  2019  analysed  by  remaining duration. The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.\n\nAlmost all linked business and non-linked investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand. For such contracts, the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability. However, we expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and therefore the tables below reflect the expected cash flows for these contracts, rather than their contractual maturity date. This table includes amounts held for sale.",

Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the 'On demand or within 1 year' column. Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument. The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis. The first repricing and call date is normally ten years or more after the date of issuance. Most  of  the  Group's  investments  in  equity  securities  and  fixed  maturity  securities  are  market  traded  and  therefore,  if  required,  can  be liquidated for cash at short notice.",

The Group chooses to take measured amounts of life risk provided that the relevant business has the appropriate core skills to assess and price the risk and adequate returns are available. The Group's underwriting strategy and appetite is communicated via specific policy statements, related business standards and guidelines. Life insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at the Group level.\n\nWe have reinsurance in place across all our markets to reduce our net exposure to potential losses. In the UK we have extensive quota share reinsurance in place on Individual Protection business and for UK Group Life protection business we have surplus reinsurance for large individual claims.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the profile of our life insurance risks, primarily longevity, persistency, mortality and expense risk, has been limited during 2020. We track the potential longer term impacts from the pandemic (e.g. morbidity impacts). We are also exposed to longevity risk through the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, to which our economic exposure has been reduced since 2014 by entering into a longevity swap covering  approximately  \u00a35  billion  of  pensioner  in  payment  scheme  liabilities.  Longevity  risk  remains  the  Group's  most  significant  life insurance risk. We purchased reinsurance for longevity risk for our annuity business, including the bulk annuity buy-in transaction with the Aviva Staff Pension scheme (see note 51). Group has continued to write considerable volumes of life protection business, and to utilise reinsurance to reduce exposure to potential losses. More generally, life insurance risks are believed to provide a significant diversification against other risks in the portfolio. Life insurance risks are modelled within the internal capital model and subject to sensitivity and stress and scenario testing.\n\nIn all of our markets, underwriting procedures on Individual Life Protection products limit our exposure to cohorts of the population at highest risk of COVID-19. While we have greater potential net exposure through Group Life Protection, we have taken pricing actions to limit our potential exposure from new business. We expect there to be some offset to increased protection claims as a result of COVID-19 from technical provision releases on our UK annuity portfolio\n\nThe assumption and management of life and health insurance risks is governed by the Group-wide business standards covering underwriting, pricing, product design and management, in-force management, claims handling, and reinsurance. The individual life and health insurance risks are managed as follows:\n\n- \u221e Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance. The Group allows businesses to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but retains oversight of the overall exposures and monitors that the aggregation of risk ceded is within credit risk appetite.\n- \u221e Longevity  risk  and  internal  experience  analysis  are  monitored  against  the  latest  external  industry  data  and  emerging  trends.  While individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and any associated capital implications. The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.\n- \u221e Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, and benchmarked against local market information. Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed. Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design. Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve the retention of policies which may otherwise lapse. The Group has developed guidelines on persistency management.\n- \u221e Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of changes in policyholder behaviour due to the exercise of options, guarantees and other product features embedded in its long-term savings products. These product features offer policyholders varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms. The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units and exposes Aviva to changes in policyholder behaviour in the exercise of options as well as market risk.\n\nExamples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are:\n\n- \u221e Options:  call,  put,  surrender  and  maturity  options,  guaranteed  annuity  options,  options  to  cease  premium  payment,  options  for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.\n- \u221e Guarantees: embedded floor (guaranteed return), maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment; and\n- \u221e Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.\n\nThe impact of these is reflected in the capital model and managed as part of the asset liability framework. Further disclosure on financial guarantees and options embedded in contracts and their inclusion in insurance and investment contract liabilities is provided in note 44.",

This risk is taken on, in line  with  our  underwriting  and  pricing  expertise,  to  provide  an  appropriate  level  of  return  for  an  acceptable  level  of  risk.  Underwriting discipline and a robust governance process is at the core of the Group's underwriting strategy.\n\nThe Group's health insurance business (including private health insurance, critical illness cover, income protection and personal accident insurance, as well as a range of corporate healthcare products) exposes the Group to morbidity risk (the proportion of our customers falling sick) and medical expense inflation.\n\nProvisions made for insurance liabilities are inherently uncertain. Due to this uncertainty, general and health insurance reserves are regularly reviewed by qualified and experienced actuaries at the business unit and Group level in accordance with the Group's reserving framework. These  and  other  key  risks,  including  the  occurrence  of  unexpected  claims  from  a  single  source  or  cause  and  inadequate  reinsurance protection/risk transfer, are subject to an overarching risk management framework and various mechanisms to govern and control our risks and exposures. We recognise that the severity and frequency of weather-related events has the potential to adversely impact provisions for insurance liabilities and our earnings, with the result that there is some seasonality in our results from period to period. Large catastrophic (CAT) losses arising as a result of these events are explicitly considered in our economic capital modelling to ensure we are resilient to such CAT scenarios.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our General insurance and health business. Our exposures, together with mitigants, are:\n\n- \u221e Business Interruption: For the significant majority of the Group's UK General Insurance commercial policies, where policy wordings are determined by the company, cover is based on a specified list of diseases. These policies exclude business interruption due to new and emerging diseases, like COVID-19. Business interruption losses stemming from the current COVID-19 outbreak are therefore not covered under the significant majority of policies but there is a risk that litigation will be required to provide legal clarity in terms of the events and the cover provided under broker determined business interruption policy wordings where we are the lead or follow insurer and many of the issues were subject to the outcome of the FCA test case. Judgement in the FCA test case was received on 15 September 2020 and followed by the Supreme Court appeal on 15 January 2021. Following the verdict the legal uncertainty in the UK around gross losses has been significantly reduced. In order to provide clarity to policyholders and mitigate exposure to future events of a similar nature, exclusions have been added to relevant policy wordings at renewal. In Canada, we are party to a number of litigation proceedings challenging coverage under certain policies; however, we do not believe there is coverage under these policies. In Ireland, the vast majority of commercial insurance products do not respond to business interruption losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In respect of broker-led wordings, Ireland continues to assess developments arising from the changing nature of Government restrictions and the outcome of both the FCA case and test case litigation in the local market.\n- \u221e Travel Insurance: We are potentially exposed to claims due to travel cancellation, disruption and sickness where this is insured by the Group, primarily in the UK. We are only exposed to losses after recoveries have been made from travel providers (e.g. tour operators or airlines) and agents. Travel disruption is not part of our Aviva UK Direct cover and was removed as a policy option on 9 March but is included as standard in the majority of the added value accounts with our banking partners. COVID-19 wording has been clarified to eliminate ambiguity, pricing adjusted to ensure risk is appropriately priced and further reinsurance cover has been purchased. These costs are offset by reduced claims frequency as a result of the current low levels of international travel, and are also partially mitigated through profit commission and future pricing agreements with distribution partners.\n- \u221e Other: There have also been impacts in other product lines as a result of reduced economic activity, for example there has been a reduction in claims frequency and a change in the severity of claims on motor lines. Private health insurance claims were also lower than expected levels in 2020 as a result of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the UK we provided a fair value pledge to policyholders to recognise the ongoing uncertainty around the ability to access treatment.\n\nThe  Group  purchases  reinsurance  protections  on  its  property  portfolio  that  includes  coverage  for  business  interruption  and  will  seek reinsurance recoveries of those of its business interruption losses that are covered by reinsurance. The continuing nature of the event means that our final exposure is subject to a significant degree of uncertainty.\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nSignificant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group. The basis of these purchases is underpinned by analysis of capital, earnings and capital volatility, cash flow and liquidity and the Group's franchise value.\n\nDetailed  actuarial  analysis  is  used  to  calculate  the  Group's  extreme  risk  profile  and  then  design  cost  and  capital  efficient  reinsurance programmes to mitigate these risks to within agreed appetites. For businesses writing general insurance we analyse the natural catastrophe exposure using our own internal probabilistic catastrophe model which is benchmarked against external catastrophe models widely used by the rest of the (re)insurance industry.\n\nThe  Group  cedes  much  of  its  worldwide  catastrophe  risk  to  third-party  reinsurers  through  excess  of  loss  and  aggregate  excess  of  loss structures. The Group purchases a Group-wide catastrophe reinsurance programme to protect against catastrophe losses up to a 1 in 250 year  return  period.  The  total  Group  potential  retained  loss  from  its  most  concentrated  catastrophe  exposure  peril  (Northern  Europe Windstorm) is approximately \u00a3150 million on a per occurrence basis and \u00a3175 million on an annual aggregate basis. Any losses above these levels are covered by the group-wide catastrophe reinsurance programme to a level in excess of a 1 in 250 year return period. In addition the Group purchases a number of GI business line specific reinsurance programmes with various retention levels to protect both capital and earnings, and has reinsured 100% of its latent exposures to its historic UK employers' liability and public liability business written prior to 31 December  2000.  The  Group's  property  reinsurance  programme  and  several  of  its  smaller  specialty  programmes  no  longer  provide coverage for pandemic catastrophes following the 1 January 2021 renewal in line with the rest of the market.",

The underlying  risk  profile  of  our  asset  management  risk  is  derived  from  investment  performance,  specialist  investment  professionals  and leadership, product development capabilities, fund liquidity, margin, client retention, regulatory developments, fiduciary and contractual responsibilities. Funds invested in illiquid assets such as commercial property are particularly exposed to liquidity risk. The risk profile is regularly monitored.\n\nA client relationship team is in place to manage client retention risk, while all new asset management products undergo a review and approval process  at  each  stage  of  the  product  development  process,  including  approvals  from  legal,  compliance  and  risk  functions.  Investment performance  against  client  objectives  relative  to  agreed  benchmarks  is  monitored  as  part  of  our  investment  performance  and  risk management process, and subject to further independent oversight and challenge by a specialist risk team, reporting directly to the Aviva Investors' Chief Risk Officer.\n\nDue to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the UK commercial property sectors, and in particular the difficulty in being able to assign values to our commercial property portfolios, we temporarily suspended our unit-linked property funds to redemptions for six months in March 2020. We perform stress tests to ensure that our portfolios are managed within client mandates.\n\n## (h)  Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events including changes in the regulatory environment. We have limited appetite for operational risk and aim to reduce these risks as far as is commercially sensible.\n\nOur business units are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks within their businesses, within the Group-wide operational risk framework including the risk and control self-assessment process. Businesses must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk tolerances are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level. Any risks with a high potential impact are monitored centrally on a regular basis. Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment. They also identify and capture loss events, taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning.\n\nCOVID-19 has resulted in an increased level of inherent operational risk through new practices including enforced remote working, staff absences for sickness and childcare, market volatility and through our outsourcing arrangements. Additional risks relating to extensive working from home; include cyber, data loss and occupational health. We have adapted and strengthened our processes and controls to ensure operational risks remain at an acceptable level. Since the onset of the pandemic the Group has remained operationally resilient, with key  activities  such  as  cash  payments  and  transaction  processing  being  maintained,  IT  systems  remaining  operational,  and  employees including frontline customer facing staff being supported to ensure that that we are there to support our customers when they need us most.\n\nAviva has not seen a material increase in the volume of cyber incidents/attacks as a result of COVID-19 but has seen external threat actors exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic within such attacks e.g. phishing, texts and phone calls. In response to this Aviva has put in place a programme of communications to ensure Aviva employees are aware of such scams, published safe homeworking guides and run online training for our employees and their families. Support has also been given to our customers, including the launch of an online reporting facility to help combat fraud.\n\nThe importance of digital interaction with our customers and advanced data analytics, the conduct, data protection and financial crime agenda of the European institutions, the FCA and other regulators, as well as the increasing cyber security threat, as evidenced by continuing instances of high profile cyber security breaches for other corporates in the UK and elsewhere, mean the Group has inherent risk exposure to data theft, conduct regulatory breaches (including financial crime) and customer service interruption due to IT systems failure. During 2020 we have continued to take action to reduce our residual exposure to these risks and improve our operational resilience through our conduct risk management framework, financial crime risk mitigation programme and significant investment in upgrading our IT infrastructure and security.\n\nOn 26 October 2020 the FCA published the outcome of its investigation into Aviva's announcement on preference shares made in March 2018. The FCA found that Aviva contravened certain provisions of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules by failing to take reasonable care to ensure that information in the announcement was not misleading and did not omit anything likely to affect the import of the information in the announcement. We have accepted the FCA decision and lessons have been learned.\n\nWe are  exposed  to  the  risk  that  litigation,  employee  misconduct,  operational  failures,  the  outcome  of  regulatory  investigations,  media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, and inadequate services, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation. Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us (or any of our intermediaries) do not perform as expected (whether or not the expectations are founded) or customers' expectations for the product change. We seek to reduce this risk to as low a level as commercially sensible.\n\nThe FCA regularly considers whether we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints. Failure to meet these requirements could also impact our brands or reputation. During 2020, the FCA published their General Insurance Pricing Practices Report. We support the FCA's intent to bring greater clarity and consistency to consumers across general insurance pricing. This will be a significant area of focus for us over the next 12 months.\n\nIf we do not manage the perception of our brands and reputation successfully, it could cause existing customers or agents to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to choose not to do business with us.",

Sensitivities  to  economic  and  operating  experience  are  regularly  produced  on  the  Group's  key  financial performance metrics to  inform  the  Group's  decision  making  and  planning  processes,  and  as  part  of  the  framework  for  identifying  and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.\n\n## (ii)  Life insurance and investment contracts\n\nThe nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements. Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit. Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business. A number of the key assumptions for the Group's central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements.\n\n## (iii) General insurance and health business\n\nGeneral  insurance  and  health  claim  liabilities  are  estimated  by  using  standard  actuarial  claims  projection  techniques.  These  methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.\n\n## (iv) Sensitivity test results\n\nIllustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and noninsurance business are set out below. For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged. Each test allows for any consequential impact on the asset and liability valuations.\n\n| Sensitivity factor                                  | Description of sensitivity factor applied                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate and investment return                 | The impact of a change in market interest rates by a 1% increase or decrease.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Group's assets and liabilities are actively managed. Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group's financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.\n\nAs  investment  markets  move  past  various  trigger  levels,  management  actions  could  include  selling  investments,  changing  investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.\n\nA number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities. Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected. In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity. Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest (discount) rates or future inflation.\n\nOther limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Group's view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.\n\n## 60 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThis note gives details of the various financial instruments the Group uses to mitigate risk.\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with the Group's overall risk management strategy. The objectives include managing exposure to market, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.\n\nIn the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments. The notional amounts reflect  the  aggregate  of  individual  derivative  positions  on  a  gross  basis  and  so  give  an  indication  of  the  overall  scale  of  the  derivative transaction. The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held (or issued) by the Group.\n\nThe fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.) master agreements or their equivalent. Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure. In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties. See note 61 for further information on collateral and net credit risk of derivative instruments.\n\n## (a)  Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe Group has formally assessed and documented the hedge effectiveness for financial instruments designated as hedge instruments in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nTo reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has designated a portion of its euro denominated debt as hedge instruments to hedge  a  net  investment  in  its  European  subsidiaries.

The amounts of cash collateral receivable or repayable are included in notes 29 and 53 respectively. Collateral received and pledged by the Group is detailed in note 61.\n\n## 61 - Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar arrangements\n\n## (a)  Offsetting arrangements\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nAviva  mitigates  credit  risk  in  derivative  contracts  by  entering  into  collateral  agreements,  where  practical,  and  into  ISDA  master  netting agreements for each of the legal entities to facilitate its right to offset credit risk exposure. The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aviva or its counterparty.\n\nDerivative transactions requiring Aviva or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit default swaps. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities. The derivative assets and liabilities in the table below are made up of the contracts described in detail in note 60.",

In some of these arrangements cash is exchanged by Aviva for securities and a related receivable is recognised within 'Loans to banks' in note 25.

The collateral received must be in a readily realisable form such as listed securities and is held in segregated accounts. Transfer of title always occurs for the collateral received.

The actual amount of collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables above in the case of over collateralisation.\n\nThe total amount of collateral received which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default, excluding collateral related to  balances recognised within 'Loans to banks' disclosed in note 25, was \u00a319,550 million (2019: \u00a320,984 million) ,  all  of  which  other  than \u00a37,505 million (2019: \u00a37,567 million) is related to securities lending arrangements. Collateral of \u00a31,633 million (2019: \u00a31,547 million) has been received related to balances recognised within 'Loans to banks' in note 25. The value of collateral that was actually sold or repledged in the absence of default was \u00a3nil (2019: \u00a3nil) .\n\nThe level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Group's risk exposure.",

The Group has equity interests in these joint ventures, together with the provision of administration services and financial management to many of them. Our fund management companies also charge fees to these joint ventures for administration services and for arranging external finance.\n\nKey management personnel of the Company may from time to time purchase insurance, savings, asset management or annuity products marketed by group companies on equivalent terms to those available to all employees of the Group. In 2020, other transactions with key management personnel were not deemed to be significant either by size or in the context of their individual financial positions.\n\nOur UK fund management companies manage most of the assets held by the Group's main UK staff pension scheme, for which they charge fees based on the level of funds under management. The main UK scheme holds investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies with other group companies, as explained in note 51(b)(ii). As at 31 December 2020, the Friends Provident Pension Scheme ('FPPS'), acquired in 2015 as part of the acquisition of the Friends Life business, held an insurance policy of \u00a3667 million (2019: \u00a3646 million) issued by a Group company, which eliminates on consolidation.\n\nThe related parties' receivables are not secured, and no guarantees were received in respect thereof. The receivables will be settled in accordance with normal credit terms.\n\nDuring the prior period, the ASPS completed a bulk annuity buy-in transaction with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (AVLAP), a Group company. At inception, the buy-in insured approximately 4,300 deferred and 1,500 current pensioner liabilities. A premium of \u00a31,665 million was paid by the scheme to AVLAP, with AVLAP recognising gross insurance liabilities of \u00a31,334 million. The difference between the premium and the gross liabilities implied a profit of \u00a3331 million, which did not include costs incurred by the Group associated with the transaction, and was driven primarily by differences between the measurement bases used to calculate the premium and the accounting value of the associated gross liabilities. The ASPS recognised a plan asset of \u00a31,126 million, with the difference between the plan asset recognised and the premium paid being recognised as an actuarial loss through Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nDuring the current period, the ASPS completed a further bulk annuity buy-in transaction with AVLAP. A premium of \u00a3873 million was paid by the scheme to AVLAP, with AVLAP recognising gross liabilities of \u00a3737 million. The difference between the premium and the gross liabilities implies a profit of \u00a3136 million, which does not include costs incurred by the Group associated with the transaction, and is driven primarily by differences between the measurement bases used to calculate the premium and the accounting value of the associated gross liabilities. The ASPS recognised a plan asset of \u00a3579 million, with the difference between the plan asset recognised and the premium paid being recognised as an actuarial loss through Other Comprehensive Income. As at 31 December 2020, AVLAP recognised technical provisions of \u00a32,147 million (2019: \u00a31,243 million) in  relation  to  buy-in  transactions  with  the  ASPS which  have  been included within the Group's gross insurance  liabilities,  and  the  ASPS  held  a  transferable  plan  asset  of  \u00a31,858  million (2019:  \u00a31,144  million) which  does  not  eliminate  on consolidation.\n\n## Key management compensation\n\nThe total compensation to those employees classified as key management, being those having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, including the executive and non-executive directors is as follows:\n\n|                                      | 2020   \u00a3m   |   2019  \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Salary and other short-term benefits | 10.7        |       12.3 |\n| Other long-term benefits             | -           |        3.2 |\n| Post-employment benefits             | 1.4         |        1.3 |\n| Equity compensation plans            | 12.8        |       12.7 |\n| Termination benefits                 | 0.6         |        1   |\n| Total                                | 25.5        |       30.5 |\n\nInformation concerning individual directors' emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors' Remuneration report.",

These were reflected in the Company financial statements at a value of \u00a3499 million following the reclassification to financial liability on the notification date. The resulting difference of \u00a31 million has been charged to the Company retained earnings.\n\n## M - Contingent liabilities\n\nDetails of the Company's contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 55.\n\n## N - Risk management\n\nRisk management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 59.\n\nThe business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiaries and joint venture operations. Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves, and full details of the major risks and the Group's approach to managing these are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 59. Such investments are held by the Company at cost in accordance with accounting policy D.\n\nFinancial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. The credit quality of receivables and other financial assets is monitored by the Company, and provisions are made for expected credit losses. There are no material expected credit losses over the lifetime of the financial assets.\n\nFinancial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings (details of which are provided in note J and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 52) and loans owed to subsidiaries. Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nLoans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates. The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments (which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations) held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each company's net exposure.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the financial statements of the company continued\n\n## N - Risk management continued\n\n## Interest rate risk continued\n\nAll of the Company's long-term external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates. However,  for  short  term  commercial  paper,  the  Company  is  affected  by  changes  in  these  rates  to  the  extent  the  redemption  of  these borrowings is  funded  by  the  issuance  of  new  commercial  paper  or  other  borrowings.  Further  details  of  the  Company's  borrowings  are provided in note J and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 52.\n\nThe effect of a 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates on floating rate loans due to and from subsidiaries and on refinancing short term  commercial  paper  as  it  matures  would  be  a  decrease/increase  in  profit  before  tax  of  \u00a3114  million (2019:  decrease/increase  of \u00a3104 million) . The net asset value of the Company's financial resources is not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Company's direct subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world. The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 59(c)(v).\n\nThe Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in Euros. However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds investments in Euros, generating the net investment hedge described in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 60(a).\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. The Company's  main  sources  of  liquidity  are  liquid  assets  held  within  the  Company  and  its  subsidiary  Aviva  Group  Holdings  Limited,  and dividends received from the Group's insurance and asset management businesses. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long-term instruments including commercial papers and medium and long-term debt. In addition to the existing liquid resources  and  expected  inflows,  the  Company  maintains  significant  undrawn  committed  borrowing  facilities  from  a  range  of  leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.\n\nMaturity analysis of external borrowings and amounts due to and by subsidiaries are provided in notes J and F respectively.\n\n## O - Related party transactions\n\nThe Company had the following related party transactions.\n\nLoans to and from subsidiaries are made on normal arm's-length commercial terms. From January 2021, as a result of LIBOR being abolished, loans previously accruing interest at specific basis points above LIBOR will now be set at a fixed rate for 5 years or up to maturity.

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nIn order to fully explain the performance of our business, we discuss and analyse our results in terms of financial measures which include a  number  of  alternative  performance  measures  (APMs).  APMs  are non-GAAP measures which are used to supplement the disclosures prepared in accordance with other regulations such as International Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  and  Solvency  II.  We  believe these  measures  provide  useful  information  to  enhance  the understanding of our financial performance. However, APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the figures determined according to other regulations.\n\nThroughout,  the  symbol  '#'  denotes  an  APM  that  is  also  a  key performance  indicator  used  as  a  base  to  determine  or  modify remuneration.\n\nThe APMs utilised by Aviva may not be the same as those used by other insurers and may change over time. The calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods unless otherwise stated.\n\nFollowing the announcement of our strategic priorities on 6 August 2020, the financial performance of our 'Core markets' are presented as UK & Ireland Life, General Insurance (which brings together our UK &  Ireland  general  insurance  businesses  and  Canada)  and  Aviva Investors. Our 'Manage-for-value' markets consist of our remaining international businesses: France, Italy, Poland, Asia and Other. The 2019 comparative results for our APMs have been restated from those previously published to reclassify operations on this basis.\n\nIn addition, the 2019 comparative amounts have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify the amounts relating to Aviva Singapore, Friends Provident International Limited (FPI), Hong Kong,  Indonesia  and  Vietnam  as  discontinued  operations.  Where relevant, these discontinued operations are presented as 'Managefor-value' markets.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the estimated Solvency II shareholder cover ratio  APM  has  been  amended  to  no  longer  make  adjustments  for planned acquisitions and disposals when deriving the shareholder view. This change in approach is considered more relevant because prior to completion there is uncertainty in relation to the progression and final terms of such transactions. Comparative amounts have not been restated for this change as the impacts were not material at 31 December 2019.\n\nAt 30 June 2020, we removed the operating expenses APM, having disclosed this metric alongside controllable costs at 31 December 2019. The controllable costs metric aligns to our capital markets  day  target  announced  in  November  2019  and  excludes premium based taxes, fees and levies that vary directly with premium volumes. Therefore, controllable costs is considered more representative  of  operational  expenses  that  are  controllable  by management and is considered more useful and relevant than the operating expenses metric.\n\n## APMs derived from IFRS measures\n\nA  number  of  APMs  relating  to  IFRS  are  utilised  to  measure  and monitor  the  Group's  performance.  Definitions  and  additional information, including reconciliations to the relevant amounts in the IFRS Financial Statements and, where appropriate, commentary on the material reconciling items are included within this section.\n\n## Group adjusted operating profit #\n\nGroup  adjusted  operating  profit  is  an  APM  that  supports  decision making  and  internal  performance  management  of  the  Group's operating  segments  that  incorporates  an  expected  return  on investments supporting the life and non-life insurance businesses. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items. The various items excluded from Group adjusted operating profit, but included in IFRS profit before tax, are:\n\n## Investment variances, economic assumption changes and shortterm fluctuation in return on investments\n\nGroup  adjusted  operating  profit  for  the  life  insurance  business  is based  on  expected  investment  returns  on  financial  investments backing  shareholder  and  policyholder  funds  over  the  reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected movements in  liabilities.  The  expected  rate  of  return  is  determined  using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic  and  market  forecasts  of  investment  return  and  asset classification.\n\nFor fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss,  the  expected  investment  returns  are  based  on  average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk. Where such securities are classified as available for sale the  expected  return  comprises  interest  or  dividend  payments  and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase. The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the opening  10-year  swap  rate  in  the  relevant  currency  plus  an appropriate risk margin.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit includes the effect of variances in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and  expenses,  and  the  effect  of  changes  in  non-economic assumptions. Changes due to economic items, such as market value movement and interest rate changes, which give rise to  variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes  in  economic  assumptions  on  liabilities,  are  disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for the non-life insurance business is based  on  expected  investment  returns  on  financial  investments backing  shareholder  funds  over  the  period.  Expected  investment returns are calculated for equities and properties by multiplying the opening  market  value  of  the  investments,  adjusted  for  sales  and purchases during the year, by the long-term rate of return. This rate of  return  is  the  same  as  that  applied  for  the  long-term  business expected  returns.  The  long-term  return  for  other  investments (including  debt  securities)  is  the  actual  income  receivable  for  the period. Actual income and long-term investment return both contain the amortisation  of  the  discounts/premium  arising  on  the acquisition of fixed income securities.\n\nFurther  details  on  APMs  derived  from  IFRS  measures  and  APMs derived  from  Solvency  II  measures  are  provided  in  the  following sections. A further section describes Other APMs.",

        "page_content": "Changes due to market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit. The impact of changes in the discount rate applied to claims provisions is also disclosed outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe  exclusion  of  short-term  investment  variances  from  this  APM reflects  the  long-term  nature  of  much  of  our  business.  The  Group adjusted operating profit which is used in managing the performance of  our  operating  segments  excludes  the  impact  of  economic variances, to provide a comparable measure year on year.\n\n## Impairment, amortisation and profit or loss on disposal\n\nGroup  adjusted  operating  profit  also  excludes  impairment  of goodwill, associates and joint ventures; amortisation and impairment  of  other  intangible  assets  acquired  in  business combinations; amortisation and impairment of acquired value of inforce business; and the profit or loss on disposal and remeasurement of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. These items principally relate to merger, acquisition and disposal activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from the Group adjusted operating  profit  APM  as  this  is  principally  used  to  manage  the performance of our operating segments when reporting to the Group chief operating decision maker.\n\n## Other items\n\nThese  items  are,  in  the  directors'  view,  required  to  be  separately disclosed  by  virtue  of  their  nature  or  incidence  to  enable  a  full understanding of the Group's financial performance. Other items in 2020 comprise:\n\n- \u221e A  charge  of  \u00a316  million  relating  to  costs  on  contracts  that  have become  onerous  following  the  disposals  of  FPI,  Singapore, Indonesia  and  Hong  Kong.  This  was  disclosed  outside  of  Group adjusted operating profit as the onerous contracts arise as a result of  disposal  transactions  which  we  consider  to  be  strategic  in nature; and\n- \u221e A charge of \u00a318 million relating to the estimated additional liability arising in the UK defined benefit pension schemes as a result of the requirement  to  equalise  members'  benefits  for  the  effects  of Guaranteed  Minimum  Pension  (GMP)  for  former  members.  This was disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the additional liability arose as a consequence of a further High Court judgement in November 2020 in the case involving Lloyds Banking Group, and does not reflect the financial performance of the Group for the year.\n\n## Other items in 2019 comprised:\n\n- \u221e A charge of \u00a345 million relating to a change in the discount rate used for estimating lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims. Consistent with the presentation of the change in the Ogden discount rate in 2016 and 2018, this was disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit; and\n- \u221e A charge of \u00a32 million relating to the negative goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Friends First in 2018, which was excluded from Group adjusted operating profit for consistency with the treatment of impairment of goodwill.\n\nThe  Group  adjusted  operating  profit  APM  should  be  viewed  as complementary to IFRS measures. It is important to consider Group adjusted  operating  profit  and  profit  for  the  year  together  to understand the performance of the business in the period.\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation between our consolidated operating profit and profit before tax attributable to shareholders' profits.\n\n|

Operating EPS is considered meaningful to stakeholders because it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over  time  by  adjusting  for  the  effects  of  non-operating  items.  A reconciliation between operating EPS and basic EPS can be found in note 15.\n\n## Controllable costs\n\nControllable costs is a useful measure of the controllable operational overheads  associated  with  maintaining  our  businesses.  These predominantly consist of staff costs, central costs, property and IT related  costs  and  other  expenses.  Controllable  costs  also  include indirect  acquisition  costs,  such  as  underwriting  overheads,  and claims handling costs. These are considered to be controllable by the operating segments.\n\nControllable costs exclude impairment of goodwill, associates and joint  ventures;  amortisation  and  impairment  of  other  intangible assets  acquired  in  business  combinations;  and  amortisation  and impairment of acquired value of in-force business. These items relate to  merger,  acquisition  and  disposal  activity  which  we  view  as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from controllable costs which  is  principally  used  to  manage  the  performance  of  our operating segments.\n\nControllable costs exclude costs in relation to product governance and  mis-selling.  These  costs  represent  compensation  and  redress payments made to policyholders and are excluded from controllable costs because they have characteristics of claims payments. In 2019 these costs included a \u00a3175 million provision in our UK Life business relating  to  past  communications  to  a  specific  sub-set  of  pension policyholders  that  may  not  have  adequately  informed  them  of switching options into with-profits funds that were available to them.\n\nControllable costs exclude premium based taxes, fees and levies that vary directly with premiums. These costs are by their nature a direct cost  incurred  as  a  result  of  generating  premium  income,  and therefore not a controllable operational overhead.\n\nControllable costs also excludes other amounts that, in management's view, are not representative of underlying day-to-day expenses involved in running the business, and that would distort the year on year controllable costs trend such as GI instalment income.\n\nFollowing a review of the presentation of claims handling costs, to achieve  consistency  in  our  reporting,  comparative  amounts  have been restated by \u00a383 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 to include previously excluded claims handling costs attributable to the Life  &  Health  businesses  from  the  UK,  Ireland  and  Poland  in controllable costs.\n\nA reconciliation of other expenses in the IFRS consolidated income statement to controllable costs is set out below:\n\n|                                                                                         | 2020   \u00a3m   | Restated 1  2019   \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|\n| Continuing operations                                                                   |             |                         |\n| Other expenses (IFRS income statement)                                                  | 3,037       | 3,057                   |\n| Add: other acquisition costs                                                            | 1,028       | 947                     |\n| Add: claims handling costs 1                                                            | 366         | 422                     |\n| Less: impairment of goodwill, associates and joint  ventures and other amounts expensed | (17)        | (2)                     |\n| Less: amortisation and impairment of intangibles  acquired in business combinations     | (71)        | (76)                    |\n| Less: amortisation and impairment of acquired value  of in-force business               | (214)       | (280)                   |\n| Less: foreign exchange (losses)/gains                                                   | (109)       | 109                     |\n| Less: product governance and mis-selling costs 2                                        | (50)        | (225)                   |\n| Less: premium based income taxes, fees and levies                                       | (192)       | (180)                   |\n| Add: other costs                                                                        | -           | 57                      |\n| Controllable costs from continuing operations                                           | 3,778       | 3,829                   |\n| Controllable costs from discontinued operations                                         | 157         | 193                     |\n| Controllable costs                                                                      | 3,935       | 4,022                   |",

The controllable costs metric aligns to our target announced  in  2019  and  excludes  premium  based  taxes,  fees  and levies that vary directly with premium  volumes.  Therefore, controllable costs is considered more representative of operational expenses that  are  controllable  by  management  and  is  considered more useful and relevant than the operating expenses metric.\n\n## IFRS Return on Equity (RoE) #\n\nThe IFRS RoE calculation is based on Group adjusted operating profit after  tax  attributable  to  ordinary  shareholders  expressed  as  a percentage  of  weighted  average  ordinary  shareholders'  equity (excluding  non-controlling  interests,  preference  share  capital  and direct capital instrument and tier 1 notes).\n\n## IFRS net asset value (NAV) per share\n\nIFRS  NAV  per  share  is  calculated  as  the  equity  attributable  to shareholders of Aviva plc, less preference share capital (both within the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position),  divided  by  the actual number of shares in issue at the balance sheet date. IFRS NAV per share is meaningful as a measure of the value generated by the Group  in  terms  of  the  equity  shareholders'  face  value  per  share investment.\n\n|                                                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of Aviva plc at  31 December 1  (\u00a3m) | 19,354 | 17,008 |\n| Number of shares in issue at 31 December (in millions)                   | 3,928  | 3,921  |\n| IFRS NAV per share                                                       | 493p   | 434p   |\n\n## Assets Under Management (AUM) and Assets Under Administration (AUA)\n\nAUM represent all assets managed or administered by or on behalf of the Group, including those assets managed by Aviva Investors and by third parties.

It is the difference between the inflows (being IFRS net written premiums plus deposits received under investment contracts) and  outflows  (being  IFRS  net  paid  claims  plus redemptions  and  surrenders  under  investment  contracts).  It excludes market and other movements.\n\nIn previous periods, this APM was labelled net fund flows and this has been updated for consistency.\n\n## APMs derived from Solvency II measures\n\nThe  Group  is  a  regulated  entity  under  the  Solvency  II  regulatory framework and therefore uses a number of APMs that are derived from Solvency II measures in addition to those that are derived from IFRS based measures.\n\nThe Solvency II regulatory framework requires insurers to hold own funds  in  excess  of  the  Solvency  Capital  Requirement  (SCR).  Own funds are available capital resources determined under Solvency II. This includes the excess of assets over liabilities in the Solvency II balance  sheet,  calculated  on  best  estimate,  market  consistent assumptions  and  include  transitional  measures  on  technical provisions  (TMTP),  subordinated  liabilities  that  qualify  as  capital under Solvency II, and off-balance sheet own funds.\n\nThe SCR is calculated at Group level using a risk-based capital model which  is  calibrated  to  reflect  the  cost  of  mitigating  the  risk  of insolvency to a 99.5% confidence level over a one-year time horizon -  equivalent  to  a  1  in  200  year  event  -  against  financial  and  nonfinancial  shocks.  As  a  number  of  subsidiaries  utilise  the  standard formula  rather  than  a  risk-based  capital  model  to  assess  capital requirements,  the  overall  Group  SCR  is  calculated  using  a  partial internal  model,  and  it  is  shown  after  the  impact  of  diversification benefit.",

The shareholder  view  is  considered  by  management  to  be  more representative  of  the  shareholders'  risk-exposure  and  the  Group's ability  to  cover  the  SCR  with  eligible  own  funds  and  aligns  with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position. In arriving at the shareholder position, the following adjustments are typically made to the regulatory Solvency II position:\n\n- \u221e The contribution to the Group's SCR and own funds of the most material  fully  ring  fenced  with-profits  funds  and  staff  pension schemes in surplus are excluded. These exclusions have no impact on  Solvency  II  surplus  as  these  funds  are  self-supporting  on  a Solvency II  capital  basis  with  any  surplus  capital  above  SCR  not recognised.\n- \u221e A notional reset of the transitional measure on technical provisions (TMTP),  calculated  using  the  same  method  as  used  for  formal TMTP  resets.  This  presentation  avoids  step  changes  to  the Solvency  II  position  that  arise  only  when  the  formal  TMTP  reset points  are  triggered.  The  31  December  2020  position  includes  a notional  reset  while  the  31  December  2019  position  included  a formal,  rather  than  notional,  reset  of  the  TMTP  in  line  with  the regulatory requirement to reset the TMTP at least every two years.\n- \u221e A  change  in  regulations  announced  in  December  2019  allows French insurers to place a part of the Provision pour Participation aux Exc\u00e9dents (PPE) into Solvency II own funds. At December 2019 PPE was included in the France local regulatory own funds but was excluded  from  the  estimated  Group  regulatory  and  shareholder own funds, subject to confirmation of the appropriate treatment at Group level. The treatment has since been confirmed and PPE is now  included  within  Group  regulatory  own  funds  but  remains excluded from the shareholder position.\n- \u221e Pro  forma  adjustments  are  made  if  the  Solvency  II  shareholder cover  ratio  does  not  fully  reflect  the  effect  of  future  regulatory changes  that  are  known  as  at  each  reporting  date.  These adjustments are made in order to show a more representative view of the Group's solvency position.\n- \u221e In  a  change  to  previous  practice,  pro  forma  adjustments  are  no longer made for planned acquisitions and disposals. This change in  approach  is  considered  more  relevant  because  prior  to completion there is uncertainty in relation to the progression and final  terms of such transactions. Comparative amounts have not been restated for this change as the impacts were not material at 31 December 2019.\n\nA reconciliation of the Solvency II regulatory surplus to the Solvency II shareholder surplus is provided below:\n\n| 2020                                       | Own funds   \u00a3m   | SCR   \u00a3m   | Surplus   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|----------------|\n| Estimated Solvency II regulatory surplus   | 29,262           | (16,441)   | 12,821         |\n| Adjustments for:                           |                  |            |                |\n| Fully ring-fenced with-profit funds        | (2,492)          | 2,492      | -              |\n| Staff pension schemes in surplus           | (1,179)          | 1,179      | -              |\n| Notional reset of TMTP                     | 564              | -          | 564            |\n| PPE                                        | (385)            | -          | (385)          |\n| Pro forma adjustments                      | -                | -          | -              |\n| Estimated Solvency II shareholder  surplus | 25,770           | (12,770)   | 13,000         |\n\n| 2019                                      | Own funds   \u00a3m   | SCR   \u00a3m   | Surplus   \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|----------------|\n| Estimated Solvency II regulatory surplus  | 28,347           | (15,517)   | 12,830         |\n| Adjustments for:                          |                  |            |                |\n| Fully ring-fenced with-profit funds       | (2,501)          | 2,501      | -              |\n| Staff pension schemes in surplus          | (1,181)          | 1,181      | -              |\n| Notional reset of TMTP                    | -                | -          | -              |\n| Pro forma adjustments 1                   | (117)            | (75)       | (192)          |\n| Estimated Solvency II shareholder surplus | 24,548           | (11,910)   | 12,638         |\n\nA  summary  of  the  shareholder  view  of  the  Group's  Solvency  II position is shown in the table below:\n\n|                                                            | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Own Funds                                                  | 25,770     | 24,548     |\n| Solvency Capital Requirement                               | (12,770)   | (11,910)   |\n| Estimated Solvency II Shareholder Surplus   at 31 December | 13,000     | 12,638     |\n| Estimated Shareholder Cover Ratio                          | 202%       | 206%       |",

For contracts  that  are  repriced  more  frequently,  weekly  or  monthly economic assumptions have been used. The economic assumptions follow Solvency II rules for risk-free rates, volatility adjustment and matching adjustment.\n\nThe  operating  assumptions  are  consistent  with  the  Solvency  II balance  sheet, when  these  assumptions  are  updated,  the year-to-date VNB will capture the impact of the assumption change on all business sold that year.\n\n## Matching Adjustment (MA)\n\nThe matching adjustment is an addition to the rate used to discount Solvency  II  best-estimate  liabilities,  to  reflect  the  return  on  the matching assets used. An MA is applied to certain obligations based on the expected allocation of assets backing new business at each year-end date. This allocation may be different to the MA applied at the portfolio level. Aviva applies an MA to certain obligations in UK Life,  using  methodology  which  is  set  out  in  the  Solvency  and Financial Condition Report (SFCR).\n\nThe  matching  adjustment  used  for  2020  UK  new  business  (where applicable) was 98 bps (2019: 95 bps) .\n\n## New business margin\n\nNew business margin is calculated as value of new business on an adjusted Solvency II basis (VNB) divided by the present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) and expressed as a percentage.\n\n## Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP)\n\nPVNBP measures sales in the Group's life insurance business. PVNBP is derived from the present value of new regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts plus 100% of single premiums from new business written in the financial period and is expressed  at  the  point  of  sale.  The  discounted  value  of  regular premiums  is  calculated  using  the  same  methodology  as  for  VNB. PVNBP also includes any changes to existing contracts which were not anticipated at the outset of the contract that generate additional shareholder risk and associated premium income of the nature of a new policy.\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of sales to IFRS net written premiums.\n\n|                                                                          | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Present value of new business premiums                                   | 43,358      | 45,665      |\n| Investment sales                                                         | 5,270       | 4,621       |\n| General insurance and health net written premiums                        | 10,232      | 10,224      |\n| Long-term health and collectives business                                | (3,647)     | (3,563)     |\n| Total sales                                                              | 55,213      | 56,947      |\n| Effect of capitalisation factor on regular premium  long-term business 1 | (14,686)    | (15,294)    |\n| JVs and associates 2                                                     | (226)       | (286)       |\n| Annualisation impact of regular premium long-term  business 3            | (399)       | (327)       |\n| Deposits 4                                                               | (9,936)     | (10,917)    |\n| Investment sales 5                                                       | (5,270)     | (4,621)     |\n| IFRS gross written premiums from existing long-term  business 6          | 5,066       | 5,057       |\n| Long-term insurance and savings business premiums  ceded to reinsurers   | (3,101)     | (2,879)     |\n| Total IFRS net written premiums                                          | 26,661      | 27,680      |\n| Analysed as:                                                             |             |             |\n| IFRS net written premiums from continuing business                       | 25,377      | 26,527      |\n| IFRS net written premiums from discontinued  operations                  | 1,284       | 1,153       |\n|                                                                          | 26,661      | 27,680      |\n| Analysed as:                                                             |             |             |\n| Long-term insurance and savings net written  premiums                    | 16,429      | 17,456      |\n| General insurance and health net written premiums                        | 10,232      | 10,224      |\n|                                                                          | 26,661      | 27,680      |",

The Group considers this measure meaningful to  stakeholders  as  it  enhances  the  understanding  of  the  Group's operating  performance  over  time  by  separately  identifying  nonoperating items.\n\nThe expected investment returns assumed within Solvency II OCG are  consistent with the returns used for Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nSolvency II OCG includes the effect of variances in experience for noneconomic items,  such  as  mortality,  persistency  and  expenses,  the effect  of  changes  in  non-economic  assumptions  (for  example, longevity), model changes that are non-economic in nature and the impact of capital actions, for example, strategic changes in asset mix including changes in hedging exposure. Consistent with the Group adjusted operating profit APM, Solvency II OCG is determined on start of period economic assumptions and therefore excludes economic variances and economic assumption changes.\n\nAn analysis of the components of Solvency II OCG is presented below, including an analysis of Solvency II operating own funds generation which  is  the  own  funds  component  of  Solvency  II  OCG  (see  the section below):\n\n|                                                   | 2020   \u00a3m   | 2019   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Solvency II own funds impact of new business      | 698         | 659         |\n| (net of tax and non-controlling interests)        |             |             |\n| Operating own funds generation from life existing | 721         | 507         |\n| business                                          |             |             |\n| Operating own funds generation from non-life      | 562         | 431         |\n| Operating own funds generation from other 1       | 6           | 944         |\n| Group debt costs                                  | (296)       | (284)       |\n| Solvency II operating own funds generation        | 1,691       | 2,257       |\n| Solvency II operating SCR impact                  | 241         | 2           |\n| Solvency II OCG                                   | 1,932       | 2,259       |\n\nSolvency II OCG is a key component of the movement in Solvency II shareholder  surplus.

The projection is a static analysis as at a point in time and hence it does not  include  the  potential  impact  of  future  new  business  or  the potential impact of active management of the business (for example, active  management  of  market,  demographic  and  expense  risk through  investment,  hedging,  risk  transfer,  operational  risk  and expense  management),  which  may  affect  the  actual  amount  of Solvency II OCG earned from existing business in future periods.\n\nFor business subject to short contract boundaries under Solvency II, allowance has been made for the impact of renewal premiums as and when they are expected to occur.\n\nThe projected surplus, which is primarily expected to arise from the release of risk margin (including transitional measures) and solvency capital requirement as the business runs off over time, is expected to emerge  through  Solvency  II  OCG  in  future  years.  The  calculation approach is consistent with prior periods.\n\nThe cash flows are real-world cash flows, i.e. they are based on best estimate  non-economic  assumptions  used  in  the  Solvency  II valuation  and  real-world  investment  returns  rather  than  risk-free. The expected investment returns are consistent with the methodology used in the Group adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Solvency II operating own funds generation\n\nSolvency II operating own funds generation measures the amount of Solvency II own funds generated from operating activities. Solvency II  operating own funds generation is the own funds component of Solvency  II  OCG  and  follows  the  methodology  and  assumptions outlined in Solvency II OCG.\n\n## Solvency II Return on Equity (RoE) #\n\nSolvency II RoE is calculated as:\n\n- \u221e Operating  own  funds  generation  less  preference  dividends,  DCI and tier 1 note coupons divided by;\n- \u221e Opening value of unrestricted tier 1 shareholder own funds\n\nUnrestricted  tier  1  shareholder  own  funds  represents  the  highest quality  tier  of  capital  and  includes  instruments  with  principal  loss absorbing  features  such  as  permanence,  subordination,  undated, absence of redemption incentives, mandatory costs and encumbrances.",

It is  an  unlevered  economic  value  measure  as  it  is  used  to  assess growth  and  performance  in  our  markets  before  taking  debt  into account.\n\nFor UK general insurance only, capital held for internal risk appetite purposes  is  used  instead  of  opening  shareholder  Solvency  II  own funds.  This  removes  any  distortions  arising  from  our  general insurance legal entity structure and therefore ensures consistency in measuring performance across markets. This is only applicable to UK general  insurance  Solvency  II  return  on  capital  and  not  to  the aggregated Group Solvency II return on capital and Solvency II return on equity measures.\n\nA  reconciliation  of  Solvency  II  return  on  capital  by  market  to  the Group level Solvency II return on capital and Solvency II return on equity is provided below.\n\n| 2020                                                          | Solvency II  operating  own funds  generation  \u00a3m   | Opening   shareholder  own funds  \u00a3m   | Return on  capital/equity  %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| UK & Ireland Life                                             | 1,057                                               | 14,241                                 | 7.4%                           |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance 2                              | 329                                                 | 2,509                                  | 13.1%                          |\n| Canada                                                        | 287                                                 | 1,442                                  | 19.9%                          |\n| Aviva Investors                                               | 67                                                  | 488                                    | 13.7%                          |\n| Manage-for-value markets                                      | 497                                                 | 8,010                                  | 6.2%                           |\n| Group centre costs and Other 2                                | (250)                                               | (2,142)                                | N/A                            |\n| Solvency II return on capital   31 December                   | 1,987                                               | 24,548                                 | 8.1%                           |\n| Less: Senior debt                                             | (12)                                                | -

This  is  calculated  as  the  closing  unrestricted  tier  1 Solvency II shareholder own funds, divided by the actual number of shares in issue as at the balance sheet date. Consistent with Solvency II RoE, it is an economic value measure used by the Group to assess growth.\n\nThe Solvency II NAV per share is shown below:\n\n|                                                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Unrestricted tier 1 shareholder Solvency II own funds (\u00a3m) | 17,358 | 16,578 |\n| Number of shares in issue at 31 December (in millions)     | 3,928  | 3,921  |\n| Solvency II NAV per share                                  | 442p   | 423p   |\n\n## Solvency II debt leverage ratio\n\nSolvency II debt leverage ratio is calculated as total debt expressed as a percentage of Solvency II regulatory own funds plus senior debt and commercial paper.

Dividend payments by operating businesses may be subject to insurance regulations that restrict the amount that can be paid. The business monitors total cash remittances at a Group level and in each of its markets. Cash remittances are considered a useful measure as they support the payments of external dividends.\n\nCash  remittances  eliminate  on  consolidation  and  hence  are  not directly reconcilable to the Group's IFRS consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe table below shows a breakdown of total Group cash remittances by market.\n\n|                                    | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| UK & Ireland Life 1,2,3            | 1,007      | 1,394      |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance 1,4 | 171        | 273        |\n| Canada 1,5                         | 131        | 156        |\n| Aviva Investors                    | 50         | 86         |\n| Core markets                       | 1,359      | 1,909      |\n| Manage-for-value markets 1         | 127        | 613        |\n| Other                              | 14         | 75         |\n| Total                              | 1,500      | 2,597      |\n\n## Excess centre cash flow\n\nThis  represents  the  cash  remitted  by  business  units  to  the  Group centre  less  central  operating  expenses  and  debt  financing  costs. Excess  centre  cash  flow  is  a  measure  of  the  cash  available  to  pay dividends,  reduce  debt  or  invest  back  into  our  business.  Excess centre cash flow does not include cash movements such as disposal proceeds or capital injections.\n\nThese  amounts  eliminate  on  consolidation  and  hence  are  not directly reconcilable to the Group's IFRS consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Centre liquidity\n\nCentre  liquidity  comprises  cash  and  liquid  assets  and  represents amounts as at the end of the month preceding preliminary results announcements.  It  provides  meaningful  information  because  it shows  the  liquidity  at  the  Group  centre  available  to  meet  debt interest and central costs and to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\n## Annual Premium Equivalent (APE)\n\nAPE  is  a  measure  of  sales  in  our  life  insurance  business.  APE  is calculated as the sum of new regular premiums plus 10% of new single premiums written in the period. This provides useful information on sales and new business when considered alongside VNB.\n\n## Spread margin\n\nThe  spread  margin  represents  the  return  made  on  the  Group's annuity  and  other  non-linked  business,  based  on  the  expected investment  return,  less  amounts  credited  to  policyholders.  The expected investment returns assumed within the spread margin are consistent with the returns used for Group adjusted operating profit. The spread margin is a useful indicator of the expected investment return arising on this business.\n\n## Underwriting margin\n\nThe underwriting margin represents the release of reserves held to cover claims, surrenders and administrative expenses less the cost of actual claims and surrenders in the period.\n\n## Unit-linked margin\n\nThe unit-linked margin represents the annual management charges on unit-linked business. This is an indicator of the return arising on this business.\n\n## Aviva Investors revenue\n\nAviva  Investors  revenue  represents  segmental  profit  before  tax excluding controllable expenses. It is a useful measure of the revenue earned  from  fund  management  activities,  adjusted  for  fee  and commission expenses.",

Statements containing the words 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'projects', 'plans', 'will', 'seeks', 'aims', 'may', 'could', 'outlook', 'likely', 'target', 'goal', 'guidance', 'trends', 'future', 'estimates', 'potential' and 'anticipates', and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Aviva believes factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements in the announcement include, but are not limited to: the impact of ongoing difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally; the impact of simplifying our operating structure and activities; the impact of various local and international political, regulatory and economic conditions; market developments and government actions (including those arising from the evolving relationship between the UK and the EU); the effect of credit spread volatility on the net unrealised value of the investment portfolio; the effect of losses due to defaults by counterparties, including potential sovereign debt defaults or restructurings, on the value of our investments; changes in interest rates that may cause policyholders to surrender their contracts, reduce the value of our portfolio and impact our asset and liability matching; the impact of changes in short or long-term inflation; the impact of changes in equity or property prices on our investment portfolio; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the effect of market fluctuations on the value of options and guarantees embedded in some of our life insurance products and the value of the assets backing their reserves; the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments; the effect of adverse capital and credit market conditions on our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital; changes in, or restrictions on, our ability to initiate capital management initiatives; changes in or inaccuracy of assumptions in pricing and reserving for insurance business (particularly with regard to mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates), longevity and endowments; a cyclical downturn of the insurance industry; the impact of natural and man-made catastrophic events (including the impact of COVID-19) on our business activities and results of operations; the transitional and physical risks associated with climate change; our reliance on information and technology and third-party service providers for our operations and systems; the inability of reinsurers to meet obligations or unavailability of reinsurance coverage; increased competition in the UK and in other countries where we have significant operations; regulatory approval of extension of use of the Group's internal model for calculation of regulatory capital under the UK's version of Solvency II rules; the impact of actual experience differing from estimates used in valuing and amortising deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and acquired value of in-force business (AVIF); the impact of recognising an impairment of our goodwill or intangibles  with  indefinite  lives;  changes  in  valuation  methodologies,  estimates  and  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  of  investment securities; the effect of legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the impact of operational risks, including inadequate or failed internal and external processes, systems and human error or from external events (including cyber attack); risks associated with arrangements with third parties, including joint ventures; our reliance on third-party distribution channels to deliver our products; funding risks associated with our participation in defined benefit staff pension schemes; the failure to attract or retain the necessary key personnel; the effect of systems errors  or  regulatory  changes  on  the  calculation  of  unit  prices  or  deduction  of  charges  for  our  unit-linked  products  that  may  require retrospective compensation to our customers; the effect of fluctuations in share price as a result of general market conditions or otherwise; the effect of simplifying our operating structure and activities; the effect of a decline in any of our ratings by rating agencies on our standing among customers,  broker-dealers,  agents,  wholesalers  and  other  distributors  of  our  products  and  services;  changes  to  our  brand  and reputation; changes in government regulations or tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business, including decreased demand for annuities in the UK due to changes in UK law; the inability to protect our intellectual property; the effect of undisclosed liabilities, execution and separation issues and other risks associated with our disposals; and the timing/regulatory approval impact and other uncertainties, such as diversion of management attention and other resources, relating to announced and future disposals and relating to future acquisitions, combinations or disposals within relevant industries; the policies, decisions and actions of government or regulatory authorities in the UK, the EU, the US, Canada or elsewhere, including the implementation of key legislation and regulation.
