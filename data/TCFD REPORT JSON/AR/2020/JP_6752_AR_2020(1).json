In view of the social circumstances at the time , Konosuke said that the mission of a manufacturer is to overcome poverty by producing an abundant supply of goods , a statement that later became known as the ' tap water philosophy. ' More specifically , no one objects if a passerby drinks from a roadside tap because the supply of water is plentiful and inexpensive. The Company ' s mission , therefore , is to create material abundance by producing and supplying goods as plentifully and inexpensively as tap water.\n\nAt the root of this concept is Konosuke ' s unique ideology about human happiness and prosperity of society. The idea is that only after there is spiritual peace of mind and a limitless supply of material goods will humanity achieve true happiness. The Company ' s mission is therefore underpinned by the thinking of ' Matter and mind as one. '",

        "page_content": "With regard to the roles that I should fulfill , I would like to focus on three themes.\n\nThe first is ' governance. ' The most important role as Chairman of the Board is governance and it is a great responsibility for me personally to steadily accomplish this task. Panasonic has hitherto reformed its corporate governance in numerous ways and endeavored to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in order to continuously engage in highly transparent and fair business activities. Six outside directors hailing from different backgrounds attend the Board of Directors meetings and lively discussions centering on opinions and questions from multiple points of view are made during the meetings. Furthermore , the Company ' s optional Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee also deliberates on matters such as CEO successor candidates and succession timing before reporting its conclusions to the Board of Directors. As a result , I believe the Board has been able to make some key decisions with transparency and objectivity , especially regarding our transformation into a group of competitive businesses as part of our transition to a holding company system (scheduled for April 2022) and change of CEO , as well as the acquisition of Blue Yonder as a wholly-owned subsidiary. In my mind , there is no doubt that this owes to the sturdy governance foundation we have laid , namely , the Board of Directors and the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee , along with the functions that have been demonstrated to the fullest. While utilizing this governance system and its functions , we will continue to reform corporate governance with the aim of further improving its effectiveness.\n\nGood governance begins with the fostering of an open and sound culture in which different people can exchange views in a free and open-minded manner and express their individuality. Having a mix of people with different perspectives and opinions , respecting each other ' s values , and combining and complementing the strengths of everyone enables us to take on new challenges not possible with the capabilities and values of a single organization. I hope to contribute to the fostering of such an organizational culture by appointing personnel brimming with diversity and having them participate in the management of the Company.\n\nThe second theme is the ' environment. ' In order to sustain an enriched society for our children , grandchildren , and beyond , it is extremely important to solve global environmental issues. For this reason , Panasonic places top priority on addressing these issues. In May 2021 , the\n\nCompany CEO Yuki Kusumi expressed our aim of becoming one of the leading companies taking steps toward solving global environmental issues. In other words , we will set our sights on becoming a leader both in our primary business which provides usefulness and in the environmental field. We will achieve this mainly by lowering our environmental footprint in all businesses through our activities at production plants and offices , as well as through our products and services , and by making significant contributions from the perspective of effectively utilizing resources through recycling and reusing. It is not easy , but that is the very reason why I believe it will be a meaningful challenge for the Company. I intend to give my full support to this initiative as we seek to become a company boasting an overwhelming presence in the environmental solutions field.\n\nAnd third , substantive ' growth. ' When I asked myself exactly what substantive growth should look like for Panasonic , a company with numerous business lines in different domains , I concluded that it should probably come down to whether or not we can generate value by keeping up with the advancement of society. That is an extremely challenging task and I feel that our performance in this regard up until now has not necessarily been good enough. Considering that companies can respond to changes and grow whilst organically changing their shape and form , thereby continuing to contribute to society and people , just like what the Company founder Konosuke Matsushita advocated in his philosophy of seisei hatten (grow and develop) , which means each day starts anew as a law of nature , we may need to once again reassess Panasonic ' s reason for existence and role in society by returning to our roots. If we understand this concept correctly when carrying out our activities , I believe we will be able to achieve substantive and sustainable growth. I consider it my duty to reflect on our reason for existence and role with an open mind from various points of view , including those from within and outside the Company , from a global perspective , and in terms of ESG issues. I intend to pursue a path that best sums up Panasonic ' s purpose and will wholeheartedly support the challenge to achieve further growth of the Company.\n\nIn my role as Director and Chairman of the Board , I will continue to draw on my experiences to support and contribute to the initiatives for achieving sustainable growth and improving corporate value , as well as the challenges our employees , organizations , and operating companies continue to take on.",

So far , in communicating with various stakeholders , including our shareholders , customers , and business partners , I have received a lot of criticism , as well as expectations. From the feedback , I feel a renewed sense of crisis , convincing me that we must accelerate our transformation , bearing in mind Panasonic ' s large responsibility to society.\n\nPanasonic is committed to ' devoting ourselves to the progress and development of society ' and ' enhancing the quality of life throughout the world. ' As societal issues , including global environmental issues , become ever more serious , we must return to the basics of our management philosophy , squarely address these societal issues , and devote ourselves to generating greater contributions toward reaching an ' ideal society. ' However , to contribute to society , it is essential that we become unrivaled in carrying out valued work , which means acquiring the ability to deliver products that are truly needed by customers and society at outstandingly competitive levels of quality , cost , and service. And we continue to refine this ability with a sense of speed every day. Only when we achieve this unrivaled level will we be able to offer true benefits , ensuring that society appreciates the sustained development of our business. Therefore , we will focus on thoroughly enhancing our competitiveness at all businesses for the next two years , becoming a team in which each employee pursues improvements day by day toward high ideals , always taking the perspectives of both the customer and the frontline operations. In the fiscal year ending March 2022 (fiscal 2022) , the first year , we will make Group-wide efforts to significantly enhance our operational capabilities and accelerate the improvement cycle.\n\nI am determined to restore Panasonic ' s management tradition , strength , and our true nature so that we can return to the path of development and become a valued company needed by all.

As a result of efforts to enhance our management structure , reform our business portfolio , and improve the profitability of the automotive business , the adjusted operating profit margin reached the 5% level for fiscal 2021 , despite the impact of COVID-19. In fiscal 2022 , the final year of the Mid-term strategy , we will continue to promote these initiatives toward achieving further improvements.\n\nAgainst this backdrop , the challenge I must take up going forward is to thoroughly enhance the competitiveness of each business in the respective industry they should address , thus allowing us to make further contributions to our customers and society.\n\nAs part of our efforts to enhance competitiveness , we will transition to a new group structure in April 2022. The aim is to accelerate management overall and enhance competitiveness in each business through more wide-ranging autonomous management. Consequently , each operating company will be further empowered , enabling those responsible for each business to make speedier business decisions based on their own operational frontlines and actual products. We will identify the areas in which each operating\n\n## Future direction for Panasonic Group\n\n## Return to the basics of our management philosophy\n\nBack in 1932 , reflecting on the social circumstances of Japan at the time , the founder of Panasonic , Konosuke Matsushita , presented what came to be known as the ' tap water philosophy* ' as a way to ' overcome poverty and bring wealth to society by producing an abundant supply of goods. ' This is based on the idea of ' matter and mind as one: only after there is spiritual peace of mind and a limitless supply of material goods will humanity achieve true happiness. ' Konosuke Matsushita then presented his very long-range plan of reaching an ' ideal society ,' which would take 250 years. It has been almost 90 years since then. However , even with the advances made in society , the essence of this ' tap water philosophy ' is also vital today based on the idea of ' matter and mind as one. '\n\nIt is true that , today , society is affluent in terms of goods , mainly in advanced nations. It seems that we need not feel any inconvenience in many aspects of life. However , when we ask ourselves if people feel enriched\n\ncompany can offer contributions reflecting medium- to longterm changes in society , create an optimal business structure for its industry and customers to address , and aim to offer customers and society contributions that are competitive with specialized manufacturers.\n\nThe holding company will play the role of implementing the management philosophy and its basic approach throughout the group so that we can offer unrivaled solutions that contribute to lifestyles and society. In addition , the holding company will guide and support operating companies in enhancing competitiveness as well as assist management in leveraging human resources , which form the basis of efforts to enhance competitiveness. Moreover , the holding company will implement selection and concentration of businesses or execute inorganic measures toward strengthening and turning around businesses as needed. Another role is to thoroughly enforce financial discipline , compliance , and safety to deal with significant risks as a Group.\n\nWhile the transition to the new structure will formally take place in April 2022 , from October 2021 , the current Company System will be terminated , and we will substantially shift our operations organizationally based on the new structure.\n\nin mind , with emotional serenity , I do not think this is necessarily the case. Many people have constant concerns , worries , and a sense of loneliness. Furthermore , environmental destruction and the depletion of natural resources are accelerating year by year. When we think about this , there is serious anxiety over whether the generations of our children , grandchildren , and beyond will be able to live an enriched life. In this sense , we have so far been engaged in business activities mainly aimed at offering products in pursuit of affluence. As a result , we now believe this path was slightly off track toward reaching an ' ideal society. ' However , it is impossible to go back. Now the question is , how can we correct our direction from where we stand today? Panasonic ' s mission today is to squarely address societal issues and attempt to reach an ' ideal society ' with affluence both in matter and mind , paving a new way. I believe continuing such efforts and making contributions unrivaled by others represents the true nature of Panasonic.\n\n\u0313",

If we want to sustain an enriched society for our children , grandchildren , and beyond , we cannot avoid responding to this global issue. We already face the impact of climate change with increased greenhouse gases , including CO2 , in many areas of the globe. The issue of depleting natural resources , such as mineral reserves , is becoming more serious every year. We can now say the situation is critical.\n\nIn 1991 , 30 years ago , Panasonic was one of the first companies  in  the  world  to  establish  an  Environmental Charter. We have been addressing the issue ever since. With this background , we are determined to make even greater contributions , leading the search for solutions to such problems as greenhouse gas emissions and resource shortages. These efforts will be made in all of our business activities at our factories and offices , as well as through our businesses: Energy business helping to reduce CO2 emissions from automobiles; Gemba (operational frontlines) Process business reducing losses of inventory and improving logistics through greater efficiency in the supply chain; and lessening of environmental burdens through such products and services as hydrogen fuel cells and Air 2 Water , which offer comfortable and environment-friendly living. Other initiatives include the promotion of recycling and reuse , as well as minimizing waste loss within the supply chain. Moreover , updating a product after sales to customers will contribute to prolonging the lifecycle of the product while also using resources more effectively.\n\nHowever , this is based on the ability to offer better value , surpassing  our  customers ' expectations  of  the product  itself , not  just  the  environmental  features.  In other words , we aim to be the top runner from the perspectives of both our inherent value and the environment. This approach will enable us to make greater contributions to the environment in the true sense. This will not be easy to do , but by taking up the challenge today , we believe we can achieve even greater competitiveness.\n\nToward this aim , in 2017 , Panasonic laid out the ' Environment Vision 2050. ' Our initiatives and responsibilities include not only ' Scopes 1 and 2 ' but also ' Scope 3 ' designated by the ' GHG Protocol ,' which is a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standard. ' Scope 1 ' and ' Scope 2 ' are classifications of energy used for our own production. ' Scope 3 ' is energy used throughout the lifecycle of our products and services , from intake of raw materials and energy con-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsumption by customers to waste recycling. At Panasonic , energy used in ' Scope 3 ' is equivalent to 40 times that used in ' Scopes 1 and 2. ' Our aim is to reduce the energy used by our products and services in society , including energy used at our factories and offices , and to work toward creation and more efficient utilization of clean energy , which exceeds the amount of energy used. Through these initiatives , Panasonic aims to achieve energy self-sufficiency as well as to help make our society sustainable.\n\nThis means we are not only depending on clean energy from the supplier side but also creating and using clean energy that exceeds ' energy used ' in ' our business activities. ' This is a very challenging target , but we will proactively make efforts in all businesses of the Panasonic Group toward reaching an ' ideal society. ' Through these efforts , Panasonic will make huge contributions to solving issues of climate change , one of the biggest global issues , and aim to become a global leader in this field.\n\nAs a milestone , we have made a commitment to aim for ' Zero CO2 emissions (carbon neutral) ' from the energy used in our own production activities by 2030 , in all operating companies under the new structure. We believe this is a target that we , as a manufacturer , should achieve immediately.\n\nMore specifically , to achieve this target , we will accelerate three initiatives: promoting further energy-saving initiatives at our own sites; equipping our facilities with in-house  renewable  energy  generation  systems;  and procuring renewable energy. In particular , for the use of renewable energy at our sites , we proactively promote the equipping and using of systems for solar power and hydrogen energy. In addition , we will proactively take up the challenge of making our sites source 100% renewable energy. So far , we have achieved this at four sites globally , including Panasonic Eco Technology Center in Japan and Panasonic Energy (Wuxi) Co. , Ltd. in China.\n\nIn addition , at our fuel cell factory of the Appliances Company (Kusatsu City , Shiga Prefecture , Japan) , we",

In this way , we can offset energy consumption in the production process with the generated renewable energy. Full operation will start April 2022. We will continue to experiment with these initiatives at this fuel cell\n\nfactory , serving as a showcase , and to refine our capabilities in the ' RE100 solutions ' business. Going forward , we will proactively expand similar projects to other sites and make these Panasonic solutions available to customers. By doing so , we will make further contributions to solving issues of climate change.\n\n## Contributing to solving global environmental issues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll business activities the Panasonic Group is involved , our customers ' living and society to become sustainable\n\nPanasonic will work towards creation and more efficient utilization of energy which exceeds the amount of energy used\n\nEnergy used < Energy created\n\n## Take up the challenge of constant improvement toward reaching an ' ideal society ' : Focus on enhancing competitiveness at all businesses for the next two years\n\nAnother aim for Panasonic is to become one of the leading companies taking steps toward reaching an ' ideal society ' by taking up the challenge of constant improvement. To do this , it is essential to gain overwhelming competitiveness , even in a severely competitive environment. The key is to make constant improvements. Here , there are two perspectives.\n\nThe first perspective is to set a high target toward reaching an ideal future , based on our customers ' essential value. Toward such targets , we should refine our capabilities every day. We want to create products leading to a new era and pursue overwhelming cost competitiveness to accelerate the penetration of such products. We will make every effort to reach this goal. In the 1930s , the founder set a goal: to deliver radios to as many households as possible by cutting the price in half. Consequently , we succeeded in reducing our radio ' s production costs by half. This represents an essential tradition of Panasonic.\n\nThe second perspective is to thoroughly eliminate waste and stagnation , and thus effectively use the valuable management resources entrusted to us from society to the full extent. We are determined to make constant improvements by eliminating any waste and making every second count.\n\nNow is the time to again implement this concept at all business operations. To be specific , we will identify factors that are the source of competitiveness for each\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Achieve zero CO2 emissions at all operating companies\n\n- - Accelerate energy-saving initiatives\n- -  Equip with in-house renewable energy generation system at own sites\n- - Procure renewable energy\n\nSmart Energy System Business Division Kusatsu Factory To use 100% renewable energy\n\nbusiness , such as product performance , environmental performance , development  efficiency , and  productivity. We will clarify targets for improving them as key performance indicators (KPIs) to enhance our competitiveness. For example , in the automotive battery business , battery performance such as energy density and cost competitiveness are the sources of competitiveness. By specifically identifying the actions required to improve these and set them as KPIs , we can clarify what should be done at each operational frontline , enabling each individual to autonomously devise plans and make improvements. By doing this , we aim to increase our business competitiveness and make each business the number one in its industry.\n\nPursing  these  initiatives  will  naturally  yield  results with cash flow generation. Based on this idea , for the next two years , we will determine areas to address and enhance competitiveness in all businesses. We will focus our efforts first on enhancing our total competitiveness , except for businesses that are likely to be damaged in the future , such as those whose markets are expected to shrink drastically.\n\nBased on my experience , I believe that ' strategy ' and ' operational capability ' are indispensable to each other for enhancing competitiveness. ' Strategy ' consists of the following  factors:  customer  targets;  areas  to  establish  an advantage among the various factors composing business; business models for cash generation; and selection of partners for business growth. That is , how to plan out the ' winning path ' of each business. ' Operational capability ' means attaining a high level of efficiency and productivity as a result of eliminating waste and stagnation as well as increas-",

        "page_content": "## About Panasonic\n\n## Message from the CEO\n\ning speed at all operational frontlines of the business; this applies not only to manufacturing but also to indirect operations like R&D and planning as well as the supply chain.\n\nNo matter how excellent the ' strategy ' may be , it cannot be effective if we do not have the capability to execute it in actual businesses. To develop business that makes contributions to customers and society , it is extremely important to gain excellent operational capabilities to facilitate the smooth flow of goods and information while also responding agilely to changes as well as to find strategic advantages. In the past , Panasonic emphasized strengthening strategic capabilities to gain new advantages , such as moving the business into new areas and transforming business models. However , in terms of ' operational capability ,' there is still a lot of room for improvement in all businesses , functions , and operations. Taking up the challenge of constant improvement means to continue increasing our ' operational capabilities ' to the full extent.\n\n## Major initiatives of business\n\nBased on these ways of management thinking , I would like to use examples of three businesses under the new Group structure to explain how we can enhance competitiveness while expanding the range of our contributions to solving environmental issues.\n\n## Gemba Process\n\nThe first example is the Gemba Process business of Panasonic Connect Co. , Ltd. under the new structure , currently Connected Solutions Company (CNS). As announced in April 2021 , Panasonic has decided to make Blue Yonder a wholly-owned subsidiary with the intention of becoming the leading global provider of logistics solutions , which will bring about a Gemba revolution in the global supply chain.\n\nPanasonic will leverage CNS ' s capability in digital and data to eliminate waste and stagnation at each Gemba comprising the supply chain. Then , we will provide solutions that bring continuous and autonomous enhancement of the entire supply chain by combining our strengths: initiatives for autonomous enhancement at the Gemba and Blue Yonder ' s software that establishes a continuous improvement cycle through end-to-end visibility and optimization of the entire supply chain. Through these solutions , Panasonic will reduce waste and stagnation at each Gemba comprising the supply chain and contribute to our customers ' management transformation. In addition , we aim to contribute to solving societal issues such as more effective use of resources and work-style reform at the Gemba.\n\nFrom the perspective of ' strategy ,' we aim to increase our advantage in this field by leveraging the partnership with Blue Yonder and refining our software and solutions capabilities. From the perspective of ' operational capability ,' we will increase adoption of this ' revolutionized supply chain solution ' at Panasonic ' s Gemba prior to offering it to customers. By doing this , we will enhance our own solutions capability as well as the operational capability of the entire Group.\n\n## Energy\n\nThe second example is our Energy Business , which will be operated by the newly established Panasonic Energy Co. , Ltd. In our automotive cylindrical battery business , which is the core of our Energy Business , we have strategically collaborated with Tesla , the leading EV company , and expanded our business where we can take advantage of our strengths. However , since our operational capability for manufacturing was not flexible enough to meet the extreme demand fluctuation from Tesla , up to now we have had to focus mainly on improving profitability. During fiscal 2022 , a new production line was installed in North America in response to surging demand. At the same time , we will thoroughly refine our operational capabilities and aim to further increase production capacity while achieving industry-leading cost competitiveness.\n\nIn terms of technological development , our current main product , the 2170 cell , has been leading the industry in performance as well as environmental impact. We will also lead the industry in the development of the 4680 cell , which is expected to become the standard size for next-generation use. With regard to further investment in the future , we intend to clarify the direction to take after we are certain that we can further improve our operational capabilities and demonstrate our competitiveness.\n\nFor non-automotive applications , we will expand our power storage system business. Our system is already highly appreciated for supporting the stable operation of data centers with a high degree of reliability. It has actually become a mission-critical system with the increasing importance of data protection in step with the development of the digital society. Going forward , as we see advances in the use of renewable energy globally , we will continue to take up challenges in the area of living-related infrastructure  such  as  our  home-use  power  storage system that provides a stable supply of electricity. In Panasonic Energy , we will thoroughly improve battery performance , reliability , and cost competitiveness while providing solutions to environmental issues and contributing to the development of social infrastructure.",

        "page_content": "## ' Lifestyle ' area\n\nThe third example is the ' Lifestyle ' area in the newly formed Panasonic Corporation. Here , our aim is to create new value toward reaching an ' ideal society ' with affluence both in matter and mind , in advance of global trends.\n\nThe indoor air quality and air-conditioning business is one of the growth pillars of the new Panasonic Corporation. Our strength in this area is that we possess wide-ranging technologies that improve air quality with minimum environmental  impact.  These  include  not  only  our  unique technologies related to sterilization , such as ' Ziaino ' and ' nanoe ,' but also moisture control , which is the key to preventing  viruses , and  highly  efficient  heat-exchange technologies. Against the background of the spread of COVID-19 , interest in air quality is increasing globally , and we expect to see even higher demand for products that integrate intelligent air quality technology and air-conditioning technology. In the new Panasonic Corporation , our aim is to create new and unique Panasonic value. One example is providing ' healthy and comfortable air. ' This will be achieved by integrating advanced technologies , which had been independently established in Appliances Company and Life Solutions Company , and forming them into a unified product or system. As the first case of this\n\napproach , in  March  2021 , we  launched  an  integrated air-conditioning/indoor air quality system in China. This product enables comfortable control of humidity according to the temperature of the ambient environment. Going forward , we will accelerate the introduction of large-scale types of such products for non-residential use , aiming to expand our solutions-type business.\n\nIn our consumer electronics business , with the establishment of China and Northeast Asia Company in 2019 , we are gaining new types of strengths in China , such as speedy product development and cost competitiveness. Going forward , we will expand these strengths globally , starting in Japan , to enhance competitiveness.\n\nIn overseas B2B business , we have succeeded in developing our wiring device business overseas by leveraging our strong manufacturing capabilities. We have been expanding in such markets as Asia , India , and Turkey , mainly for residential use. Going forward , we aim to expand this business to non-residential use such as buildings and retail shops , in cooperation with the indoor air quality and air-conditioning business. Here , we will leverage the strengths we have built up so far , including the distribution channels we have cultivated and the trustworthy reputation we have nurtured through our brand among customers in these countries.\n\n## Putting our Management Philosophy into action and aiming to become a valued company needed by society\n\nWith the idea that ' A company is a public entity of society ' as the basis of our management , Panasonic has grown as a company , together with our stakeholders. Through our business activities , we have made contributions to the development of society and solutions to societal issues , utilizing the various management resources entrusted to us by society. This way of thinking has not changed even today , as time has passed and society has developed. Rather , as various societal issues become more serious on a global scale and the international community aims to build a sustainable society , by such means as achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) , management based on our original mission will become even more important.\n\nI  believe  that  squarely  addressing  various  societal issues , including global environmental issues , and taking up the challenge of making a greater contribution to the development of society and the resolution of pressing issues will also lead to further improvement of business competitiveness. Management to increase corporate sustainability through contributions to achieving a sustainable society can also be described as ESG management. From\n\nPanasonic ' s perspective , this is precisely about implementing our management philosophy.\n\nBased on this way of thinking , Panasonic will strive to help reach an ' ideal society ' so that our children , grandchildren , and beyond can live with affluence both in matter and mind. And we will aim to become a valued company needed by society , thus enhancing corporate value from the perspective of stakeholders as well as enterprise value from financial aspects. I would like to ask for your continued support of Panasonic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The use of the word ' connected ' in our new company name reflects our intention to provide further added value to customers by ' connecting ' technologies. For example , customer supply chains (the gemba for manufacturing , logistics , and retail) are plagued by labor shortages , but operational processes are growing increasingly complex in order to swiftly meet the diversifying needs of consumers. To address our customers ' management issues , we endeavor to optimize operational frontlines and improve productivity by connecting software and the latest technology to robust hardware and also by incorporating the knowledge and know-how we have accumulated from manufacturing into our services and solutions.

'\n\nWe will focus our resources on fields that require solutions to social issues. For example , reducing manpower to alleviate labor shortages in factories , improving the reliability and safety of information and telecommunication infrastructure to cope with data explosions in an IoT-driven society , and accelerating the shift to environmentally compatible vehicles designed for a mobility society.\n\nWe intend to bring together the capabilities and knowledge we have honed thus far in developing device technologies to deliver characteristically distinct value with competitive devices based on our proprietary materials and process technologies , as well as with systems with competitive devices at the core. In particular , we will work together with our customers to expand the domains through which we can make contributions to society , based on our three core businesses: FA solutions , electronic materials , and capacitors.\n\nFurthermore , as part of our contribution towards solving global environmental issues , we will aim to achieve carbon neutrality in our production activities and actively take steps to reduce our environmental footprint by further improving product performance.\n\nAs a true partner that our customers keep coming back to , we will continue to help bring about a sustainable and prosperous society by acutely responding more than ever before to changes in society with a sense of speed and a strong sense of mission.\n\nWebsite: https://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/industry.html",

Its vertical focus is manufacturing , retail , and logistics companies.\n\nBlue Yonder optimizes supply chains and inventory and labor management using its unique end-to-end platform , powered by leading AI/ML technology. Disruptions were caused by the global pandemic and port blockages such as those experienced at the Suez Canal in March 2021. However , by using Blue Yonder ' s solutions , customers were able to track inventory in real time , consider backup plans , and switch to alternative logistic routes and carriers.\n\nSince  supply  chain  efficiency  and  control  is  so mission-critical to the competitiveness of its customers , they seldom replace Blue Yonder ' s solutions because they are considered best-in-breed by Gartner and other leading analyst firms. Blue Yonder enjoys a strong and recurring business revenue model. Moreover , Blue Yonder has accumulated years of vertical and industry expertise with 3 , 000 global customers , which it has leveraged to develop new offerings and solutions using the power of AI/ML.\n\nTimeline of acquisition as a subsidiary\n\nApril 2021\n\n## Acquisition\n\nExpansion of autonomous SCM globally\n\nJuly 2020\n\nNovember 2019\n\nEstablishment of joint venture\n\nCollaboration on SCM integrated solutions\n\n20%\n\n## investment\n\nExpansion of strategic partnership Joint go-to-market activities in Japan Development of joint solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanufacturers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlogistics companies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Towards an Autonomous Supply Chain\u2122\n\nPanasonic and Blue Yonder have their sights set on realizing the Autonomous Supply Chain\u2122.*\n\nAn Autonomous Supply Chain\u2122 eliminates wastefulness between and within companies and significantly saves resources across the entire supply chain. For instance , it has the potential to greatly reduce food waste and food losscurrently a challenge faced by society-by autonomously linking demand and inventory changes in the retail industry with food manufacturer production and stock purchasing. In addition , more efficient operations can help solve issues faced by management , such as workforce aging and the lack of successors.\n\nIn  working  towards  the  achievement  of  a  sustainable society , the two companies will first accelerate the development of solutions that combine their respective strengths and push ahead with the rollout of SCM solutions throughout the Panasonic Group.\n\n- *  Autonomous Supply Chain\u2122 refers to optimized operations achieved automatically  in  the  supply  chain , from  upstream  to  downstream , through autonomous linking of software with devices and sensors at the gemba (operational frontlines).\n\nBy strengthening our relationship with Blue Yonder thus far , we were able to confirm some positive signs in the area of value creation and strong affinity from the perspective of culture. After a series of discussions by the Board of Directors and management meetings , the decision was made to make Blue Yonder a wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nretailers\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are undertaking initiatives with an awareness of financial discipline under our capital allocation policy of generating cash needed for investments , structural reforms , and dividend payments from cash flow generated by businesses , divestitures , and the sale of assets.\n\nGuided by this basic approach to capital policy , with the overall objective of breaking away from a low-profitability structure during the three-year Mid-term strategy that started in fiscal year ended March 2020(fiscal 2020) , we continue to reform our business portfolio , enhance our management structure , and improve profitability in automotive business.\n\nFor our business portfolio reform , we are concentrating our resources in focus areas that we consider to be growth fields and working to reinforce our competitiveness and improve profitability through partner collaborations and other means. To enhance our management structure , we are reducing personnel costs and indirect operations , lowering fixed costs by mainly consolidating facilities , and rolling out radical reforms of businesses having loss-making structures. To improve profitability of automotive business , we are working to thoroughly strengthen our profitability structure and enhance competitiveness in each business , by focusing on areas where we have advantages in terms of customers and products.\n\n## Business operations during the COVID-19 crisis and future outlook\n\nIn fiscal 2021 , the global spread of COVID-19 infections seriously affected the movement of people and goods and triggered a sharp contraction in the global economy , primarily in the first half of the fiscal year. Our businesses were also heavily impacted and headed into the new fiscal year with uncertainties in the operating environment. Sales  declined  due  to  a  market  downturn  stemming mainly  from  outing  restrictions , while  sales  opportunity losses arose because parts procurement difficulties forced our plants to suspend operations or lower their operating rates.\n\nIn the first quarter , sales and profits were negatively affected in all business areas , mainly in Automotive and Connected Solutions which were severely affected by deteriorating conditions in the automotive and aviation industries.  Sales  decreased  significantly  in  real  terms after excluding the impacts of exchange rates and deconsolidation , while adjusted operating profit (profit generated by businesses) recorded a loss due to the impact of lower sales and other factors. In this challenging operating environment , as a measure aimed at improving profitability , we stepped up the pace of the fixed cost reduction initiatives under our Mid-term strategy that we have continued to drive forward as an internal project since last fiscal year. The spread of COVID-19 infections has also largely transformed working styles , so much so that working remotely has now become the norm. We therefore drastically reviewed the conventional way of using fixed costs for activities such as business trips , meetings , and exhibitions , and succeeded in thoroughly reducing them. We will continue with such efforts to further enhance our cost structure. On the other hand , on the business front , business opportunities reflecting changes in society are arising , and we are capturing such opportunities.\n\nAlthough sales in real terms continued to decrease from the same period in the previous year in the second quarter , there was a noticeable recovery in sales in each business , notably Automotive and Appliances segments. In addition to the Mid-term strategy initiatives we had continued to implement in order to enhance our management structure , such as reducing fixed costs and dealing",

        "page_content": "with businesses having loss-making structures , the benefits of thoroughgoing cost reductions began to materialize , which helped adjusted operating profit turned to an increase from the same period in the previous year. In the second half too , as the economic environment continued to recover , we controlled the level of fixed costs by steadily pushing ahead with measures for enhancing our management structure. We recorded an increase in both sales and profit due to contributions to profit improvements from businesses responding to changes in society , including air-conditioning and indoor air quality , public health-related services , automotive batteries for EVs , and information and communication technology.\n\nIn  full-year  results , sales  decreased  largely  due  to the impact of COVID-19. Operating profit and net profit decreased due mainly to the impact of one-time gains in other income/loss recorded in the previous fiscal year. However , adjusted operating profit increased to 307.2 billion yen and the adjusted operating profit margin improved to 4.6% from 3.8% last year.\n\nIn terms of enhancing our management structure-one of the initiatives in the Mid-term strategy-we made profit contributions of 60 billion yen through fixed-cost reductions , with employees vigorously promoting the measures identified within the Company. And we achieved our midterm target of 100 billion yen ahead of schedule , reflecting progress made towards improving profitability in the businesses that have loss-making structures , including a return to profit in the TV business. In particular , fixed costs overall decreased by approximately 180 billion yen from the previous year , partly reflecting the impact of lower sales and lower production caused by COVID-19. As for our business portfolio reform , we established a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corporation in the automotive prismatic battery business , set the direction for the semiconductor and solar businesses , made a strategic equity investment of acquiring a 20% stake in Blue Yonder as an investment for growth , and ramped up automotive battery business production capacity at our North America factory. Moreover , in terms of profitability improvement of the automotive business , adjusted operating profit turned profitable after recording a heavy loss in the previous fiscal year through productivity improvements and rationalization of materials. We have made steady progress on our Mid-term strategy initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom the viewpoint of return on invested capital , ROE has held steady at more than 10% over the medium term , averaging 11.7% for the last five years , but it dropped to 7.2% in fiscal 2021 owing to a decline in net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders and the continued accumulation of stockholders ' equity. For fiscal 2022 we forecast ROE of 8.0% , the same level as the cost of stockholder ' s equity , but we will aim to steadily achieve at least 10% by continuing to advance initiatives aimed at improving profitability.\n\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 is likely to remain in some businesses in fiscal 2022 , we will look to tap business growth opportunities mainly in the areas of 5G , IoT , and air-conditioning and indoor air quality. We will also aim to drive sales and profit growth by staying the course to enhance our management structure. In particular , we will implement tight cost controls according to the circumstances of each business to ensure that fixed costs do not return to previous levels as sales and production activity recovers. In this way we will work on perpetuating the cost reduction benefits realized the year prior. We forecast adjusted operating profit (profit generated by businesses) of 390 billion yen and an adjusted operating profit margin of over 5% , higher than in fiscal 2020 , prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\n## Financial initiatives in an uncertain operating environment (financing , cash flow generation , shareholder returns)\n\nThe  spread  of  COVID-19  infections  through  the  start of fiscal 2021 also significantly affected our finances. Given that there was no visibility on how much of an impact  COVID-19  would  have  going  forward , share prices plunged in the stock markets and there was major upheaval in direct financing markets , including instability  in  commercial  paper  and  other  short-term  money markets. In light of this situation , we used global financial networks to summarize the state of our cash , both over and short , and based on that information we started considering the measures we would need to take. Our finances were also greatly affected during past financial crises , such as the global financial crisis in 2008. Based on our experiences at that time , we ran simulations of the impact on our finances and formulated risk scenarios envisaging a decline in cash. As a measure for preparing for this possibility , we made it our top priority to secure liquidity on hand.\n\nSpecifically , we secured cash on hand in excess of 1 , 000 billion yen. And we strengthened our finance structure by securing other means of financing , in addition to the commitment line contracts we already have with financial institutions. We also lengthened the duration of short-term funds by issuing domestic unsecured straight bonds worth 200 billion yen in December 2020.\n\nFree cash flow in fiscal 2021 was 680.6 billion yen , reflecting  improvements  in  profit  and  working  capital , business transfers as part of our business portfolio reform , and the sale of shares held. We have also exe-",

For example , we made a strategic equity investment of acquiring a 20% stake in Blue Yonder. As a result , our financial stability has steadily improved with net cash turning positive and stockholders ' equity also increasing to 2 , 594 billion yen as of the end of fiscal 2021 through the accumulation of net profit.\n\nI believe the aforementioned disciplined financial management  and  progress  on  improving  profitability  have been evaluated favorably by credit rating agencies.\n\nAs for returning profits to shareholders , because of the decline in net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders in fiscal 2021 , it is with much regret that we have had to lower the annual dividend by 10 yen year on year to 20 yen in line with our dividend policy of basically distributing profits according to consolidated results. In fiscal 2022 we will continue with efforts from the latter half of last year to improve earnings so that we can return profits to shareholders.\n\n## Dividends (Dividends declared per share)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making necessary investments to capture growth opportunities\n\nAs part of Mid-term strategy Panasonic has continued to roll out initiatives with the aim of breaking away from a low-profitability structure. Through these efforts , over the past two years we have pursued co-creation with external partners in order to reform our business portfolio , and we have implemented concrete measures one after the other with a focus on improving profitability , including measures for those businesses having loss-making structures. Meanwhile , so that we might enhance the competitiveness of the entire Panasonic Group and achieve medium- to long-term growth , it is crucial that we accurately identify and never miss growth opportunities and make investments in a well-focused manner in accordance with business conditions.\n\nIn the Gemba (operational frontlines) Process business-which we consider to be an area of focus-shifting to solutions business and driving growth in recurring business have been a pressing issue. Toward this aim , we have been deepening our strategic partnership with Blue Yonder through setting up a joint venture in 2019 and acquiring a 20% equity stake in the company in 2020.",

        "page_content": "To further accelerate this initiative , we made the decision to acquire Blue Yonder as a wholly-owned subsidiary for a total acquisition price of approximately 750 billion yen. This move will enable us to quicken the pace of Gemba process innovation and reinforce operational capabilities in our own supply chain.\n\nAt the same time , it is extremely vital that we are able to maintain a sound financial position even after the deal is closed , in spite of the temporary financial impact from the acquisition and the recording of sizeable intangible assets and goodwill. To that end , from the perspective of financial stability that we emphasize in our basic approach to capital policy , we especially made sure that the acquisition would align with our capital allocation policy , and we also examined the impact it would have on our credit rating. Our capital allocation policy defines our approach to the generation and allocation of cash for the purpose of shifting management resources towards sustainable growth under our Mid-term strategy. Guided by this approach , in addition to the generation of operating cash flow , through the optimization of our business portfolio and the sale of assets , we were able to generate cash flow of about 2 , 200 billion yen , including a reduction in lease liabilities through divestitures. As a result , after using the necessary capital mainly for investments , dividends , and structural reforms , we have around 1 , 000 billion yen of excess cash , which means that the amount required for this acquisition is within the range of cash generated. We also carefully examined the acquisition ' s impact on our credit rating. In order to stably maintain our credit rating after the acquisition and ensure that we still have the capacity to make investments in the future , we are considering the use of hybrid financing in which a certain level of equity value is recognized for credit rating purposes.\n\nUp  ahead , after  Blue  Yonder  has  been  made  a wholly-owned subsidiary , we will steadily carry out a PMI (post-merger integration) and set our sights on enhancing the company ' s business value and generating synergy effects. We will endeavor to strengthen the Gemba Process business-a focus area for Panasonic-and by extension , further  boost  the  competitive  edge  of  the entire Group and improve its financial position.\n\n## Transition to a holding company system\n\nThe Panasonic Group has made a decision to transition to a new group structure from April 2022. The current Panasonic Corporation will serve as a holding company and seven operating companies will be placed under its umbrella. Each operating company will be empowered to make decisions concerning business matters. By taking autonomous management to the next level like this , we will speed up overall management and enhance the competitiveness of each business.\n\nAt the same time , it is also important that the operating companies are disciplined in their use of capital. Each operating company will carry out management that is conscious of capital costs and strive to generate a certain level of return on the capital they have been allocated. Operating\n\ncompanies can invest the cash generated in excess of capital costs to enhance their own competitiveness within their authority based on the Group ' s approach to autonomous management. Subsequently , this will further drive growth and improve the corporate value of the entire Group.\n\nMoreover , it is even more important that each operating  company , as  an  independent  business  entity , is directly accountable to the capital markets as ' a public entity of society. ' They are expected to gain further understanding of their respective businesses by holding strategy and performance briefings in an effort to communicate more proactively.\n\n## Putting our management philosophy into action and aiming to enhance corporate value\n\nWe have long undertaken business activities based on the management philosophy that ' A company is a public entity of society. ' In other words , we believe our raison d ' \u00eatre is to continually push ahead with efforts to provide solutions to various social issues through our business activities and grow together with society and stakeholders. It is also really important that we deepen our dialogue with stakeholders regarding these kinds of activities.\n\nCurrently , the  environment  surrounding  corporate management  is  changing  significantly.  Companies  are expected to make high-level contributions to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , an agenda the international community has its sights set on achieving , mainly in the area of climate change. And calls from investors within and outside of Japan for companies to disclose and discuss ESG information are growing stronger as ESG investing is rapidly increasing worldwide.\n\nUnder these circumstances , contributing to the SDGs and undertaking ESG initiatives are precisely about implementing our management philosophy. The entire Panasonic Group , under the leadership of CEO Yuki Kusumi , is united in advancing initiatives toward solving global environmental issues through its business activities. These initiatives will not only improve the sustainability of society , but they will enhance our corporate value from the perspective of stakeholders as well as enterprise value from financial aspects , and lead to the long-term , sustained development of the Company.\n\nAs for dialogue with the capital markets , we intend to actively engage in dialogue with our shareholders and investors through the disclosure of information in an integrated manner incorporating our business and management activities as well as ESG. In addition , we plan to hold briefings focusing on ESG topics.\n\nFor Panasonic to become a valued company needed by society and in order to enhance our enterprise value , we must return to the basics of , and put into practice , our management philosophy. We must also endeavor to gain the capital markets ' understanding of our initiatives and make best use of their valuable opinions to improve our management approach.\n\nI look forward to your continued support of Panasonic going forward.",

' This policy is also consistent in how we approach R&D (research and development). I intend to offer my support from a technological perspective to build the pillars of businesses that can help bring about a society characterized by sustainability and well-being.\n\nIn April 2022 , the Panasonic Group will transition to an operating company system. While each operating company will focus their efforts on research topics that synchronize with the idea of making each business more ' specialized and sharpened ,' Panasonic Holdings Corporation (hereinafter , ' the holding company ' ) will pursue R&D from a medium- to long-term perspective to contribute considerably to society as a group and reinforce the common foundational  technology  that  underpins  each  operating company. I intend to support those operating companies that are going to develop a dynamic new business and I will also provide support from technological perspectives to the Group ' s overall portfolio management.\n\nFurthermore , according to the roles of operating companies and of the holding company , I intend to clarify what will continue and what will be changed going forward in terms of how R&D should be , when compared to the Group ' s previous Company System.\n\nBuilding the pillars of tomorrow ' s Panasonic businesses with GX and DX , aiming to achieve a society characterized by sustainability and well-being\n\n## Tatsuo Ogawa\n\nExecutive Officer Group Chief Technology Officer (Group CTO)\n\nTechnology  administration  and  management  at  the holding company will become extremely important up ahead and I am keenly aware that these are my roles as Group CTO.\n\n## R&D outlook\n\nIn offering my support from a technological perspective to build the pillars of businesses so that we can envision a society characterized by sustainability and well-being , I especially intend to tackle head-on initiatives related to green transformation (GX) and digital transformation (DX).\n\nIn terms of GX , since 2010 we have set our sights on becoming  the  No.1  Green  Innovation  Company  in  the Electronics Industry. Not only do we adopt measures to conserve energy in our own operations , but we have long been engaged in the business of mainly fuel cells and storage batteries , of which the latter contributes greatly to the electrification of vehicles. Moreover , in May 2021 we committed to the target of zero CO2 emissions (carbon neutral) at all operating companies by 2030. Going forward , we will work towards realizing the Panasonic Environment Vision 2050 (please refer to ' Message from the Environmental Compliance  Administrator ' ) , which  mainly  outlines  our response to climate change , by designing energy-saving products in order to reduce the amount of energy used , and also by research and development related to energy technology such as battery , hydrogen , and so on , in order to further increase and make use of the energy created.",

        "page_content": "As for DX , we will continue offering contributions by maintaining the connection with customers through products and services even after shipping with the use of IoT technology and AI. For example , the building of a digital platform that collects digital data-based information about how customers use home appliances as a framework for better understanding the day-to-day lifestyles of customers is almost complete. We intend to utilize the information we accumulate to offer personalized functions with which users can customize IoT-connected home appliance settings , as well as voice-push notification service informing the user that the appliance has completed an operation. In addition to day-to-day lifestyle settings , we hope to expand our IoT and AI capabilities to business and mobility settings. For instance , smart cameras installed in retail stores or facial recognition entry/exit systems.\n\nWe are also working to uncover issues by gauging the situation of every user based on information acquired from IoT devices and sensors and then offering improvement measures to create an optimal condition for each user. This will enable us to provide value based on our understanding of users. We are also launching a new service model combining software and people based on the value we provide , instead of the previous concept of enriching people ' s lives with hardware.\n\n## Converting the diversity of Panasonic into value\n\nPanasonic operates a variety of businesses and we deal with customers in all of our business fields. In the areas\n\nof devices , home appliances , housing , services , and solutions , we hope to establish a unique position by converting the interactions we have with various customers into value. To that end , we need to change the very way we  engage  in  technological  development  by  switching from our mainstay product design approach of mass production and mass consumption to a context design approach under which individual customers can identify and express value. We hope to work on creating value together with customers and continually make contributions to customers in a better way even after they have received our products.\n\nFurthermore , in addition to our diverse business lineup , we will look to draw on our strengths of trust and confidence forged thus far and break away from the conventional notion of vertical integration whereby the Company would carry out all of the work and the roles to take charge of the horizontal division of labor. Instead , we will seek to play a hub-like role in a network-type project best suited to the social contributions we aim to deliver.\n\nAlso , as society shifts from mass production and mass consumption to one that is more recycling oriented , we will have to make changes to our R&D portfolio from the viewpoints of ESG and sustainability.\n\nWe hope to understand what it is that people essentially need in their lives and place importance on the perspective  of  how  technology  can  better  assist  people rather than being at the forefront of everything in place of humans. With this in mind , we intend to embrace a wide variety of challenges going forward.\n\n## Initiatives on intellectual property\n\nIn solving the complex problems currently plaguing the global environment , an unprecedented level of diversity is required in terms of the resources required to deliver solutions , including technology , human resources , and intellectual property. Through intellectual property we aim to realize co-creation by building appropriate relationships with stakeholders and we are therefore promoting the merging of these various resources. By setting a policy that these initiatives will lead to solving global environmental issues and in doing so , boosting our business competitiveness , we are stepping up efforts to strengthen relationships and collaborate with customers and partners by utilizing intellectual property.\n\nMore specifically , in the field of automotive batteries we are accelerating collaboration and pushing ahead with the building of supply chains as we work towards solving environmental issues by fusing the strengths of our partner companies with the technologies we have developed that balance high quality/reliability with low costs , including related intellectual property.\n\nThrough these kinds of initiatives we intend to work hand in hand with partner companies to help solve environmental issues and promote activities even in the area of intellectual property to ensure that our irreplaceable planet remains plentiful and clean.",

It ' s digital, it ' s our value.\n\n## Hajime Tamaoki\n\nExecutive Officer Group Chief Information Officer (Group CIO)\n\nUnder a new organizational structure , Panasonic is currently propelling initiatives to exhaustively strengthen its competitiveness  by  making  each  business  more ' specialized and sharpened. ' The business environment nowadays is entirely dependent on digital technology and it would be no exaggeration to say that IT is indeed a key pillar of corporate management and the driver of differentiation. Panasonic too must ramp up its Group-wide efforts in the area of digital transformation (DX). However , much of our IT-which a successful DX hinges upon-is unfortunately outdated and still consists of mainly individually optimized or old legacy systems , so it is absolutely essential that we shore up our overall IT framework. Accordingly , in May 2021 we launched in earnest our so-called Panasonic Transformation (PX) project to achieve a DX at the Company.\n\n## Transformation framework\n\nThe word ' transform ' basically refers to a change in the true nature of something. As part of the PX , we believe we need to promote genuine transformation on three layers and we have already decided what needs reinforcing on each layer and have started taking concrete action.\n\nAt  the  top  is  the  transformation  of  business  or  IT itself. In the middle is the transformation of our operating model needed to deliver it. At the bottom is the most critical and most challenging layer-the transformation of culture that underpins the accomplishment of the two aforementioned transformations. Properly advancing all of these transformations will be crucial. For example , if nothing other than cloud computing installation on the top layer is implemented , changes are unlikely to become entrenched and things will revert back to the old ways of doing things. So in this sense , the transformations on these three layers need to be implemented collectively. To that end , all employees in departments , not just the Information Systems Department , involved in the PX as a Panasonic Group-wide transformation project under the\n\nownership of CEO Kusumi must work together to drive the project forward.\n\n## Transformation framework\n\n## IT transformation\n\nRenewal of infrastructure and business information systems , digitization of processes and services , etc.\n\n## Operating model transformation\n\nOrganizational structure , delivery mechanisms , relationship with partner companies , cost optimization , etc.\n\n## Culture transformation\n\nPromotion of DEI* , open and flat work environment , breaking out of silos , eliminating inward-looking jobs\n\n* Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\n## IT transformation (IT strategy)\n\nHaving been subjected to business reorganizations over the years , our IT systems have undergone numerous integrations and separations , while those in charge of information  systems  have  followed  suit  and  successively added new functions on top of old platforms in order to meet worksite requests for completing certain tasks with IT technology. As a result , we have ended up with a disjointed collection of individually optimized systems that are unable to agilely respond to the pace of business and management. But rebuilding everything will require a vast amount of time and money. That is why in the PX , the prerequisite for transforming IT itself will rest on supporting each Panasonic business to become ' specialized and sharpened ' and making business operations more efficient , and to achieve that , we have selected four optimal programs: (1) modernization of legacy systems; (2) maintenance of master data; (3) use of cloud computing; and (4) SCM streamlining and improvement. We are currently assigning concrete themes to these programs , launching\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition , we are working closely with business divisions and employees at the gemba (operational frontlines) to simplify and standardize business processes with a ' back-to-basics ' approach that is essential to IT implementation.\n\n## Operating model transformation (organizational transformation)\n\nTo overhaul the IT supply chain framework that efficiently delivers outputs under the aforementioned IT strategy , we will revamp not only our Information Systems Department , but also all aspects of management resources that encompass it , such as people , goods , and capital. Even though we have carried out large-scale IT innovation projects before , the fact that we are delving deep into this layer is the biggest thing that sets the PX apart from prior projects. As we work towards transforming management , the gemba , and processes , we intend to push ahead with seven projects , including the following: mechanism of incorporating IT into the management agenda; personnel management reforms; vendor governance and commercial flow innovation; and transformation of IT subsidiaries as a core of service delivery. We must pay particular attention to the point that ' changing how to do things is the same as turning to become more ' Agile ' . ' Here , the use of the word agile does not simply refer to the method of IT developmentit means switching to an agile working style that can pave the way towards organizational transformation. We will make sure that this transformation drives an acceleration in management and business by emphasizing the following key points: eliminating inward-looking works and shifting thoroughly to a customer perspective; frequently delivering small results instead of a big result over a long term; and flexibly responding to changes rather than executing tasks as planned. We have also linked these activities to the third layer (culture transformation) , launched an agile center modelled on our Operational Excellence Company , and commenced trials on a small scale. Based on the outcome of these activities , we intend to gradually have the entire Panasonic Group adopt more agile working styles and culture.\n\n## Culture transformation\n\nThe transformation framework (PX) is supported from the ground up by changes in organizational culture , the mindsets of individuals , and working styles. We believe these sustained transformations are the very reason why we can accomplish the PX for the first time. Accordingly , we have continued to put into practice throughout the Group the plan of One Panasonic IT (breaking out of silos) , open and flat work environment , a zero-tolerance policy (ensuring psychological safety at work) , and the elimination of inward-looking jobs. Moreover , for the benefit of not just the Information Systems Department , but also for all of the people involved in developing the IT and systems for driving the PX project forward together , for the first time in 13 years we renewed the mission statement of\n\nthe Information Systems Department that was formulated in 2008. The department ' s vision has been defined as ' Bring happiness to life. Bring happiness to work. It ' s digital , it ' s our value. ' We consider both life and work are\n\nso important to us all , including our customers , so  we  are  committed to deliver even more happiness to people ' s day-to-day lives with digital technology and our own endeavors. It is my wish for everyone in the Panasonic Group to enthusiastically pursue transformation under the PX project to turn Panasonic into a radiant company that makes contributions to society as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Two-year roadmap and a further step towards ' genuine DX '\n\nWe are formulating a new three-year mid-term plan starting in April 2022. For the PX too , we view the current scenario as the first iteration of the project , or PX1.0 , which will first shore up our basic footings , much like the seismic retrofitting process. After we have properly consolidated a foundation , we intend to redefine new strategies and value in each business and ensure they are consistent with the new IT strategy for PX2.0 , which will evolve and grow into a business model transformation and new value creation , driven by cutting-edge digital technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Prepare the Company DX agenda\n- Build promotion teams\n- Create momentum for change (raise atmosphere in the Panasonic Group by renewing mission statement , etc.)\n\nFrom October 2021\n\nFrom October 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Build solid foundation for two years\n- \u00b7  Legacy modernization\n- \u00b7  Master data maintenance\n- \u00b7  Cloud implementation\n- \u00b7  Streamlining and optimization of SCM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Utilize AI to strengthen operations (Blue Yonder solutions)\n- Provide services closer to the lifestyles of individual customers\n- Drastically reduce lead time of product development operations\n\n## Aiming to further strengthen security measures\n\nWe fully recognize the importance of security measures when undertaking corporate activities such as the DX project discussed above. Alongside countermeasures for addressing a recent case of unauthorized access to one of our file servers , we will endeavor to further strengthen our security measures. Security measures based on a zero-trust network have been also discussed at Group management meetings and a decision has been made to strengthen our approach in fiscal year ending March 2023 (fiscal 2023) by earmarking a security investment budget that is more than double that of previous years. Given the responsibility of the Panasonic Group to protect sensitive customer data , the Company will continue to steadily work on building a safe and secure remote working environment for employees together with a zero-trust network.",

Based on this ' people-come-first ' thinking , our vision is to become ' The Best Place to Work where diverse talents work at their best. ' As we set our sights on bringing about an ' ideal society ' with affluence both in matter and mind , we intend to push ahead with our human resources strategies designed to develop people , organizations , and corporate culture , whilst also spearheading challenges in operating divisions.\n\n## Environment surrounding human resources and type of employees we seek to develop\n\nThe  environment  surrounding  human  resources  has changed dramatically in recent years , and will most likely continue to evolve going forward. It is expected that the worldwide decline in the working-age population as a percentage of overall population will persist , but at the same time , technology capable of replacing labor , such as AI and robotics , is evolving dramatically. Furthermore , an era in which more people will likely live to the age of 100 is fast approaching with life expectancies in mainly developed countries continuing to increase. As such , prolonged careers and diversified personal values toward working are constantly progressing. And some of these environmental changes have intensified all at once as a result of the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn the midst of such dramatic changes in the operating environment , the Panasonic Group will transition to an operating company system in April 2022. Under this new Group structure , we will thoroughly implement a style of autonomous management whereby each business confronts social and environmental issues on a 10-year time horizon , manages  their  respective  businesses  with  a view to resolving such issues , and works persistently to\n\n## Spearheading the challenges of operating divisions with people , organizations , and corporate culture that respect diversity\n\n## Shigeki Mishima\n\nExecutive Officer Group Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) In charge of DEI (Diversity , Equity & Inclusion)\n\nPromotion\n\nstrengthen their competitive edge.\n\nAccordingly , we ask that every employee proactively takes on the challenge of making contributions to society and fully demonstrates their respective capabilities. So that we can continue to be an organization where employees grow and play active roles , I believe it is crucial more than anything else that we build mutually benefiting relationships between the Company and its employees. This should entail the employees autonomously developing their  own  career  by  combining  the  Company ' s  future direction with their own challenges and the Company providing opportunities for such challenges and fully supporting their endeavors.\n\n## Building the systems and frameworks best suited for the needs of respective industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe aim of the new Group structure from April 2022 is to have each operating company thoroughly engage in autonomous management and build a business structure best suited to their respective industry , customers , and competition. Accordingly , each operating company will go about building optimal systems and frameworks for the industry in which they do business , particularly with",

Meanwhile , the  operating  companies will be supported by Panasonic Holdings Corporation in terms of a Group-wide human resources strategy and by Panasonic Operational Excellence in terms of efficiency and sophistication of strategy execution.\n\n## Group-wide strategy\n\n## Development of management executives\n\nFor the sustained development of each operating company , a diverse pool of managers that can drive business forward is absolutely essential. To that end , we are working to create a pipeline of successors over the medium to long term. Each operating company is responsible for promoting the development of senior management and successor candidates , but for the nurturing of the next generation of operating company presidents-some of the most important management postings in the Group-we are currently promoting the development of a diverse pool of management executives irrespective of nationality , work history , gender , age , or other attributes based on a policy of fast-tracking and ' the right person for the right job ,' * 1 all the while paying particular attention to the following values as a Group-wide approach.\n\n- (1)  Provide career opportunities at a stage earlier than when such opportunities were afforded to oneself in order to develop leaders better than oneself\n- (2) Provide extremely challenging roles\n- (3) Secure a diverse candidate pool\n\nOther components that make up the Group ' s common platform include the assessment of management executives and executive candidates , the monitoring process for training progress , and the discussion/determination process concerning the selection and appointment of executive candidates by the Group Talent Management Committee.\n\nAs for training sessions for executive candidates , we are currently preparing optimum programs to be hosted within and outside of the Company. We also continue to run the two programs we launched in fiscal year ended March 2021 (fiscal 2021): Launching Executive Leaders* 2 and Creating Executive  Leaders* 3 .  Moreover , in  fiscal  2022  we  are endeavoring to enhance the content of training by organizing the Learning Program for Newly Appointed Panasonic Group Executive Officers as well as the Panasonic Group Business Philosophy and Management Workshop.\n\nThese systems for developing management executives are now delivering results from the perspective of ' the right person for the right job. ' There have been more cases that the human resources we have hired from outside the Company play active roles as a leader of business management or of a certain function. We have also standardized how we assess human resources in the Group\n\nbased on the following considerations: Competencies , Traits & Drivers , Performance , and Experience & Skills. To facilitate the process , we have developed assessment tools and already assessed hundreds of executive candidates. We have also finished formulating future candidate selection and career development plans. These career development plans have been reviewed by the Group Talent Management Committee and reflected into our new Group structure as October 1 , 2021.\n\n## Basic process for the development of management executives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promotion of DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion)\n\nThe Panasonic Group has thus far been a pioneer in society in terms of introducing various working styles , including telecommuting , and rolling out various systems for childcare , nursing care , and for the benefit of employees who identify as LGBTQ. And in this day and age of a rapidly evolving social environment in which values are growing increasingly diversified , continuing to replicate the initiatives we have implemented thus far will not be sufficient enough going forward. In October 2021 we formulated the Panasonic Group DEI (Diversity , Equity & Inclusion) Policy by incorporating ' Equity ,' our views on seeking fairness in providing opportunities for each person , into our existing policy on diversity & inclusion and embarked on a new challenge of articulating the position of the new policy as a Group strategy. By leveraging the diverse opinions of a diverse workforce in the management of the Company , we will seek to generate greater value and continue to make contributions to society.\n\n- *1  Nominating a person that is most qualified for the position from within or outside the Company (the right person for the right job).\n- *2  Training that aims to have participants comprehensively leverage their competency to think and act in a way that is conducive to change and put management principles into action.\n- *3  Training that aims to have participants equip themselves with self-awareness of the management skills to adopt a customer-oriented approach , think strategically , and execute reforms by leveraging management literacy.",

        "page_content": "## Messages from Outside Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## -  For what reasons did you accept the position of outside director at Panasonic and what do you think is your role on the Board of Directors?\n\nTo be honest , I was in two minds about accepting the position of outside director partly because the timing of when I was offered the role coincided with my appointment as a director of Uzabase. On the other hand , I have felt that interest in society about sustainability is growing , particularly the awareness among business leaders. This got me thinking about the social significance of corporations and the purpose of Uzabase.\n\nAt Panasonic , which is about to change , if I can play a part in contributing value to society , I can make a big impact on society. This also represents a rather big challenge for me personally. Considering the significance of this endeavor , I decided to accept the offer.\n\nYuki Kusumi was appointed Panasonic ' s new Group CEO this year-the first change in Group CEO position took place in a while. At the timing of the top management ' s rejuvenation , my opinions from the viewpoints of child-rearing generation , which may be different from those of highly experienced outside directors , could be of some help. And given my experience thus far at an IT startup , I believe one of my roles at Panasonic , a manufacturing company , is to bring simple questions and a new way of thinking to the Board based on a completely different culture and basic assumptions.\n\n## - What is your impression of the Company?\n\nMy impression is that the Company is certainly in the thick of major changes. It is no easy feat for a corporation with some 240 , 000 employees to make changes , but that is the very reason why I think Panasonic can have an enormous impact on society when those changes materialize. That ' s why it is very important that the Company changes\n\n## Contributing to reform by realizing DEI\n\n## Shinobu Matsui\n\nOutside Director\n\nDirector , Uzabase , Inc. After working as an accounting auditor and consulting manager of international taxation , Matsui joined the company and served as COO , etc. as an executive officer. Appointed outside director of Panasonic in June 2021.\n\nfor the better , as the impact brought by the changes is so huge. For this reason , I think the Company ' s basic business philosophy* that a company is a public entity of society is a really great premise for change. If Panasonic can really achieve a situation in which all 240 , 000 employees are always aware of earnestly seeking to contribute value to society in their day-to-day work , I believe it can definitely create a lot of positives for society and fulfil its corporate social responsibilities.\n\n*The Basic Business Philosophy\n\nhttps://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/management/philosophy.html\n\n## - What are your expectations of the Company?\n\nI believe there are some tasks only Panasonic is capable of achieving to help bring about society ' s vision of a sustainable planet. Those environmental initiatives outlined in the Panasonic Environment Vision 2050 are surely the ones that only Panasonic can accomplish , so I certainly want to see the Company vigorously push forward and achieve its targets.\n\nI also think it is important for Panasonic to thoroughly promote diversity , equity , and inclusion (DEI). So that every employee in its diverse workforce can fully unleash their potential , I think the Company needs to instigate a major change to drastically overhaul its existing organizational culture because simply switching systems and the like is not good enough. Finding out which direction to take is impossible without recognizing the issues at hand , but Panasonic has a solid understanding of the gap between its vision for DEI and the status quo , so all it needs to do now is work on bridging that gap. I see this as a positive. Going forward , I want to see the Company leverage its experience and expertise to realize DEI , and I hope the active participation of a diverse workforce generated from that will translate into more value for society.",

        "page_content": "Yoshinobu Tsutsui Outside Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHiroko Ota Outside Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management philosophy\n\nPanasonic has a management philosophy to be proud of from the time of the Company ' s founder. It incorporates long-term perspectives and concepts rooted in the Japanese business principle of sanpo-yoshi (three-way satisfaction for seller , buyer , and society) , and even has direct ties to modern-day ESG issues. Constant communication of this philosophy by the CEO is most important if it is to be realized in all of the Company ' s global business operations. I am confident that the way our new Group CEO , Yuki Kusumi , has gone about instilling an awareness of this philosophy since taking office will create a firm foundation for enhancing the Company ' s corporate value.\n\n## Governance concerning nomination and compensation\n\nWhen nominating the new CEO , in addition to excellent decision-making skills and a sense of responsibility as a leader , among other factors , I attached particular importance to the candidate ' s ability to globally communicate the Company ' s philosophy and strategy , as well as visionary foresight to calmly take stock of the ever-changing operating environment. On these points , Group CEO Kusumi possesses unquestionable leadership potential and I believe he is the right person to front the management team and live up to the expectations of investors by enhancing medium- to long-term corporate value.\n\n## Environment\n\nPanasonic must place ESG issues , especially those relating to the environment , at the very center of its medium- to long-term strategy. As a member of the global business community , the Company is expected to play an extremely significant role in contributing to the well-being of various stakeholders and society as a whole. I believe that tackling environmental issues from a broad-ranging scope is in itself the Company ' s business calling and the most important medium- to long-term strategy for enhancing corporate value.\n\n## Governance concerning nomination and compensation\n\nWhoever is at the top of the new structure must possess a certain degree of toughness and composure to entrust management operations to each operating company and sternly ask them to be accountable for their business results. I believe our new Group CEO , Yuki Kusumi , has the toughness and flexibility required for the job. I expect he will lead the Group ' s transformation up ahead with a considerable sense of speed and create businesses boasting overwhelming profitability.\n\n## Governance in the organization\n\nHanding over authority and responsibility to each operating company will certainly reinforce business operations as part of Group management , but at the same time , it is important that the business portfolio is optimized so that the Group as a whole is geared up for growth. For that to happen , governance of a more robust nature is required. Risks must be controlled in light of the Group ' s overall management strategy and risk awareness must be shared with all employees of each operating company in every corner of the workplace. In other words , the Group must enhance both inward and outward forces.\n\n## Innovation (digital transformation , etc.)\n\nThe Company has thus far undertaken initiatives geared towards enhancing its technological capabilities and powers of innovation. However , disruptive innovation based on discontinuous concepts that break from the past is driving today ' s digital transformation. I hope the Company can foster a flexible organizational culture that is welcoming of new ideas and different ways of thinking without being bound by continuity and strengths from days gone by.",

In the midst of destructive environmental changes and future unpredictability and increasing complexity , the burdens that future management executives will have to bear are growing heavier. For this reason , it is important to develop a group of outstanding CxO candidates to tackle and solve various issues.\n\n## Governance concerning nomination and compensation\n\nIn Panasonic ' s case , each operating company is a corporate entity of roughly the same size and facing the same level of strategic difficulty as other listed global companies. Moreover , we are now in an era of ESG and sustainability management , which demands that business leaders are even more proficient. In that sense , we need to develop a better pool of human resources with an eye to the future 10 or 20 years from now. The Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee and departments executing business are therefore working as a team to address this challenge.\n\n## Innovation (digital transformation , etc.)\n\nWhen looking ahead to a post-COVID-19 operating environment , it is increasingly likely that innovation stemming from digital transformation (DX) efforts pursued thus far , as well as innovation with origins in the so-called ' green transformation ' (GX) in connection with environmental issues , will newly wield disruptive influences. I intend to be supportive of the management reforms undertaken by the new Group CEO and management team going forward in order for the Group to exploit the disruptive changes generated by DX and GX and turn them into drivers of growth.\n\n## Innovation (digital transformation , etc.)\n\nTo generate innovation , management executives must discuss the goals associated with solving social issues , but at the same time , they must take risks and provide a setting in which younger employees can play an active role. I expect the Company to generate innovation in the supply chain field , in particular , by solving the numerous issues that arise in the course of working together with Blue Yonder to build a platform and utilize data in order to give tangible shape to solutions that can transform supply chains.\n\n## Environment\n\nCarbon neutrality is not something we can achieve by executing one major plan. Instead , every employee at all worksites must come up with ideas and put them into practice. In terms of renewable energy , the development of new technology that is long-lasting is crucial , and above all , it is important that we break away from the concept of saving energy and make improvements to the way we go about reducing the amount of ' energy used ' by , for example , setting a bold reduction target of one third and comprehensively visualizing the energy we currently consume.\n\n## Governance in the organization\n\nWith the holding company focusing its attention on dealing with compliance issues and risks , it is important that the operating companies steadily take on board external opinions , including those of outside directors at Board of Directors meetings and those of external experts by way of advisory board systems.",

In particular , there is presently no time to waste in responding to climate change. I believe it is crucial that the Company works towards achieving its stated goal of carbon neutrality whilst keeping in mind the ideas of placing a sustainability strategy at the core of its management strategy , adopting the initiatives for addressing climate change at worksites and linking them to the management philosophy , promoting such initiatives at full speed from the outset , and collaborating even with competitors.\n\n## Diversity\n\nIn sustainability management , harnessing the power of diversity to invigorate the organization and accelerate business activities is key. Rather than gradually encouraging a change in mindset , I definitely want to see the Company give tangible shape to its management that understands personalities , provides opportunities , and leverages the individuality of all employees by taking bold measures that trigger changes in behavior.\n\n## Management philosophy\n\nTo achieve a management philosophy that forms the very basis of the Company ' s activities , it must be incorporated into daily tasks and worksite operations at all Group bases around the world. Also , if the practical implementation of the management philosophy fails to contribute to both the benefit of society and profitable growth of the Company , it is unlikely it will enhance corporate value. I would like to see the entire Company pull together as a team and go the extra mile to implement a management philosophy that is in step with the current times.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Structure and Initiatives\n\n## Compensation\n\nThe  Company ' s  remuneration  system  for  Directors comprises  a  fixed  remuneration  which  is  the ' basic remuneration ,' a  short-term  incentive  which  is  the ' performance-based  remuneration ,' and  a  long-term incentive which is the ' restricted stock as remuneration ,' based on the duties of Directors. The ratios between the basic remuneration , the performance-based remuneration (when standard values were achieved) , and the restricted stock compensation are set at 1:0.75:0.25 generally. Outside Directors and A&SB Members receive only a fixed compensation or the ' basic remuneration ' in the form of monthly monetary remuneration.\n\nThe optional Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee , majority-staffed and chaired by independent Outside Directors , deliberates on the appropriateness of the Company ' s policy and system for determining remuneration of Directors and reports the results to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors makes a resolution on the policy for determining the remuneration based on the report. The outline is provided below.\n\n## Basic remuneration\n\nThe Company determines the amounts of fixed basic remuneration , which is fixed compensation , based on the roles of recipients , taking also into account the management environment , their responsibilities and the remuneration trends of other companies.\n\n## Performance-based remuneration\n\nThe ' performance-based remuneration ' is a short-term incentive and is provided to boost motivation to improve business  performance , and  its  amount  is  determined based on a single-year performance evaluation of the entire Company and a specific business of which a Director is in charge. The ' performance-based remuneration ' is designed in a way that the amount of payment will increase according to the results. The payment rate of the basic remuneration ranges from 0% to 150% (when the standard value is achieved: 75%). The performance is measured using a combination of key management indicators which the Company should continue to attach importance to , such as adjusted operating profit (Note) , net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders and operating cash flows. Specifically , the performance of Directors is evaluated based on the comparison between the results of each of such indicators in the previous fiscal year and numerical targets of the fiscal year in which they are evaluated.\n\n(Note) A management indicator for Panasonic calculated by subtracting Cost of sales and Selling , general and administrative expenses from Net sales.\n\n## Restricted stock compensation system\n\nRestricted stock compensation is a long-term incentive and is a type of stock compensation in which the restriction of transfer of shares is lifted subject to Directors serv-\n\ning the Company for a specified period of time , and is allocated with the aim of providing an incentive to continuously improve corporate value and promote further value sharing with the Company ' s shareholders. The ratio of the incentive option to the overall remuneration package is designed to increase as the position of the recipient Director gets higher. In addition , the amount for each recipient is set based on overall considerations of various factors , such as duties of each Director and the balance with monetary remuneration.\n\n## Method for determining amounts of remuneration\n\nRemuneration  for  Directors  is  determined  within  the framework of the maximum total amounts of remuneration for Directors which was determined by resolution of a general meeting of shareholders. As to the amounts of basic remuneration and performance-based remuneration to be paid and the number of shares to be allocated to each recipient , the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee examines whether these amounts and number are appropriate in light of the policy for determining the remuneration , and reports the results to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has left the decision-making  on  the  remuneration  solely  to  Representative  Director , President  of  the  Company  who objectively  comprehends  and  supervises  overall  business execution of the Panasonic Group. As Representative Director , President of the Company makes decisions as to basic remuneration , performance-based remuneration , and restricted stock compensation to each recipient in accordance with the results of deliberation at the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee , the Board of Directors believes his decision is in line with the policy for determining remuneration. Five members of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee , Outside Director Hiroko Ota (Chair) , Outside Director Kazuhiko Toyama , Outside Director Yoshinobu Tsutsui , Director and Chairman of the Board Shusaku Nagae , and Representative Director , President Kazuhiro Tsuga , held a meeting to discuss the remuneration for fiscal 2021. As a result , Representative Director , President Kazuhiro Tsuga determined the details of the remuneration based on the results of the discussion.

        "page_content": "## Message from the Environmental Compliance Administrator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs climate change continues to wreak greater havoc worldwide , all of the countries attending the COP26 summit in November 2021 pledged to step up their efforts on limiting  the  global  average  temperature  increase  to  1.5\u02daC above  pre-industrial  levels-as  set  out  under  the  Paris Agreement-and work towards achieving ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets.\n\nEver  since  the  founding  of  the  Panasonic  Group , we have gone about solving social issues in line with our management philosophy of contributing to the development of people ' s lives and society through our business activities. In 2017 we formulated the Panasonic Environment Vision 2050 and we continue to actively work towards solving climate change issues mainly in the fields of energy and resources.\n\nIn the Environment Vision 2050 , we set a target of expanding ' energy created ' to exceed the amount of ' energy used ' by 2050 in all of our business activities , including those that fall under Scope 3. In other words , the Panasonic Group , through business development and expansion , will contribute to solving climate change issues by adopting measures in the energy field to curb CO2 emissions.\n\nIn order to realize our vision as soon as possible , in May 2021 we announced the milestone target of net-zero CO2 emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) at all operating companies by 2030. As a first step , we will work towards reaching carbon neutrality at Panasonic.\n\nMore specifically , we will make thoroughgoing use of energy-saving measures and effective use of renewable energy generation systems , while accelerating the procurement of renewable energy at our own sites. One example of this is that Panasonic Energy (Wuxi) Co. , Ltd. in China realized a zero-CO2 model factory which became our fourth manufacturing site in March 2021 through the installation of state-of-the-art energy-saving technology and the effective use of renewable energy. In addition , at our fuel cell factory in Kusatsu (Shiga Prefecture) we are focusing on hydrogen as a new source of carbon-free energy; thus , we are promoting an ' RE100 ' solution (solution for business operation with 100% renewable energy) to cover all of the electricity used in the factory ' s manufacturing processes with a mix of pure hydrogen fuel cells , solar power generation , and\n\n## Contributing to solving climate change issues in the fields of energy and resources\n\n## Hirotoshi Uehara\n\nDirector , Quality & Environment Division\n\nstorage batteries.\n\nMoreover , we will push ahead with the continuous development of energy-saving products in an effort to lower CO2 emissions (Scope 3) generated by the products we manufacture and sell. On top of this , we will look to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions at our customers and in society in general by creating clean energy with the use of hydrogen , developing automotive batteries that cater to the growing shift towards EVs , and offering energy-saving products and services and renewable energy-powered solutions.\n\nWe will harness these initiatives in a bid to make bigger contributions towards reducing emissions of our B2B and B2G customers and seek to deliver reductions that outweigh our own emissions in Scopes 1 , 2 , and 3 , all of which we consider to be our responsibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFiscal 2021 figures\n\nMeanwhile , as part of our efforts in the resources field , we are taking steps to lower CO2 emissions across the lifecycle of our products by incorporating our views on a circular economy in a bid to achieve sustainable growth without relying on the consumption of resources. For example , as part of our efforts to create circular economy businesses , we  are  currently  trialing  a  bicycle  sharing  service  with IoT-linked electrically-assisted bicycles with power-saving smart lock at Tsunashima Sustainable Smart Town (SST). We are also continuing to develop materials that have little impact on the environment. We successfully developed the processing technology to mix into resin a high concentration-70% to be precise-of cellulose fibers made from natural materials , as well as the molding technology to turn that resin into products.\n\nThe Panasonic Group , through these kinds of business activities , is committed to helping lower GHG emissions in society at large and solving the issues of climate change.",

We therefore intend to reduce these so-called Scope 3 emissions by pursuing greater energy efficiency.\n\nAlso , in terms of quantifying our contributions to reducing  emissions , which  is  something  the  International Electrotechnical Commission is currently discussing , we will aim to further strengthen our proposals to B2B and B2G customers regarding how to curb their CO2 emissions  through  our  products  and  services  and  seek  to deliver reductions that outweigh our own emissions by the year 2050.\n\nWe intend to accelerate the pace of initiatives designed to curtail not only our own CO2 emissions , but also those of our customers and society as a whole.\n\nOur approach to reducing CO2 emissions in the various industries in which we do business will have an impact on accelerating the global shift towards carbon neutrality. We refer to these reduction contributions as ' Panasonic GREEN IMPACT ,' which we aim to expand throughout the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

By  making these factories leading models and by providing the accumulated know-how to other factories around the world , we will steadily propel manufacturing activities that do not emit CO2.\n\n## Panasonic Energy (Wuxi)\n\nIn March 2020 , Panasonic Energy (Wuxi) effectively reduced to zero its emissions of around 44 , 000 tons by promoting production activities that use minimum energy , installing photovoltaic power generation systems , procuring I-REC certified energy , and utilizing carbon credits trading to offset emissions of fossil fuel-derived CO2 and a rooftop-leasing scheme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Resources-related initiatives\n\n## Creation of circular economy businesses\n\nIn order to effectively utilize resources and maximize customer value , we are working to create circular economy businesses , such as sharing services , products as a service , repair/maintenance , refurbishing , and remanufacturing.\n\n## IoT-linked electrically-assisted bicycles with power-saving smart lock\n\nFor one of our sharing services , we are testing an optimal management system for bicycle operations by gauging demand for IoT-linked electrically-assisted bicycles with power-saving smart lock and collecting and analyzing data mainly on areas of movement and travel distances at Tsunashima Sustainable Smart Town (SST).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hydrogen energy\n\nWith our sights set on realizing a carbon-free society , the Panasonic Group is pursuing the development of fuel cell technology using hydrogen as a new source of energy. At the Kusatsu Factory-our fuel cell plant-full-scale operations powered by 100% renewable energy sources will come online from April 2022.\n\n## Kusatsu Factory , Smart Energy System BD\n\nWith a mix of hydrogen fuel cells , solar power , and storage batteries , plus the creation of its own renewable energy , the factory is promoting an RE100 solution with the use of 100% renewable energy to cover all of the electricity used in its manufacturing processes. Through repeated substantiation , the Kusatsu Factory will seek to further enhance this project as a RE100 solution business.\n\n## Evolution of recycling-oriented manufacturing\n\nWe continue to develop materials that have less of an impact on the environment. As a way of reducing the amount of resin used in our products , we are developing and commercializing a composite polypropylene (PP) resin that contains plant-derived cellulose fiber as an additive.\n\n## Reusable cups made with cellulose fibers\n\nWe have developed the processing technology to mix plant-based cellulose fibers into resin at a concentration of up to 70% (previously 55%) , as well as the molding technology to turn the resin into products such as reusable cups , which we have now started selling.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives regarding People , Organizations , and Corporate Culture\n\nFor the purpose of boosting self-motivation , a readiness to take on challenges , and greater participation by each and every employee in a safe and secure workplace , we continue to undertake initiatives from the following points of view: self-determined career formation , promoting DEI , and creating safe and secure workplaces.\n\n## Self-determined career formation\n\nThe Panasonic Group encourages its employees to seize the initiative and take on challenges and we have a number of systems that support the self-motivated endeavors of employees. For example , in Japan we offer job transfers within the Group and external working experience (secondment to external start-ups , etc.) , as well as in-company multitasking  (offering  concurrent  postings  within  the Company).  Approximately  1 , 000  to  2 , 000  employees every year put their hand up for these programs , and around 300-500 actually taking part in a new challenge. Even after we transition to an operating company system , we intend to keep running and further developing the system of job transfers within the Group across all operating companies as a Group-wide common program.\n\nOne  other  Group-wide  initiative  is  the ' A  Better Dialogue ' project , which supports every employee ' s personal growth and challenges by enhancing the quality and quantity of dialogue with their respective managers. In addition to one-on-one meetings that bring out the aspirations of each and every employee , this project is comprised of three other components: development of individual career and capabilities , goal setting & management , and competency review. Since the Company-wide launch of this initiative in 2019 , satisfaction levels of one-on-one meetings have risen every year to roughly 77% in Japan in fiscal year ending March 2022 (fiscal 2022). \u5b9f\u614b\u628a\u63e1\u00b7\u7d4c\u55b6\u5e79\u90e8\u306e\u2f8f\u52d5\u5909\u2fb0\u3001\n\n## A Better Dialogue (ABD)\n\nengagement as an indicator of employee self-motivation , employee  enablement , and  respect  for  the  individual. The results are shared in the workplace and utilized in the development of human resources and organizations. Accordingly , the results of the survey are improving in terms of the number of favorable responses we receive.\n\n## Promoting DEI (Diversity , Equity & Inclusion)\n\nWe  are  currently  promoting  DEI  from  three  perspectives based on the Panasonic Group DEI Policy. The first is ' top management commitment. ' This means management members themselves are committed to promoting DEI and do so by incorporating it into business strategies. Starting in 2022 , we plan to accelerate the pace of our strategic initiatives by convening Group DEI Promotion Council meetings , for  example.  Furthermore , we  are  actively expressing our support for , and providing assistance to , various movements in society. For instance , the 30% Club Japan , a global campaign that aims to raise the proportion of women in critical decision-making roles in business , and Equality Act Japan , a signatory campaign that calls on the Japanese government to enact legislation protecting the LGBT community from discrimination. We utilize our support of these programs in Group initiatives.\n\n## Promoting DEI from three perspectives\n\n## Creating an inclusive work environment \u5b9f\u614b\u628a\u63e1\u00b7\u7d4c\u55b6\u5e79\u90e8\u306e\u2f8f\u52d5\u5909\u2fb0\u3001 \u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7b56\u5b9a\u3001\u7d4c\u55b6\u6226\u7565\u3078\u306e\u7e54\u308a\u8fbc\u307f\u3001 \u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u7b56\u5b9a\u3001\u7d4c\u55b6\u6226\u7565\u3078\u306e\u7e54\u308a\u8fbc\u307f\u3001\n\n\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30eb-\u30b7\u30d6\u306a\u8077\u5834\u74b0\u5883\u3065\u304f\u308a\n\n\u7d99\u7d9a\u7684\u306a\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb-\u30b8 \u7b49\n\n\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30eb-\u30b7\u30d6\u306a\u8077\u5834\u74b0\u5883\u3065\u304f\u308a\n\n\u30a2\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30b7\u30e3\u30b9\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec-\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3001\n\n\u7d44\u7e54\u958b\u767a\u306a\u3069\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7d44\u7e54\u00b7\u2fb5\u2f1f\u8ab2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe second perspective is ' creating an inclusive work environment. ' It is about building a management and organizational environment where diverse individualities are valued and fully utilized. In October 2021 we hosted the Group DEI Forum. This event featured a live video feed  broadcasted  to  around  6 , 700  participants , along with  the  streaming  of  pre-recorded  videos.  Each  participant ' s understanding of , and identification with , DEI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup DEI Forum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvery year we conduct the Employee Opinion Survey (EOS) targeting all Group employees as an initiative for conducting a fixed-point observation of the awareness levels of every employee concerning mainly employee",

Moreover , we continue to roll out unconscious bias training sessions in each geographical region in which we have a business presence. In Japan we are training ambassadors* at all of our business sites in a bid to continuously expand these sessions to every organization manager and employee in the Group.\n\nThe third one is ' support for unique individuals. ' We are developing a support system and improving HR management systems and frameworks , among other measures , in an effort to provide support so that each person can make full use of their diverse individuality to have opportunities to grow. For example , in North America we support groups of women , ex-servicemen , people who  identify  as  LGBTQ , millennials , and  people  with non-white ethnic backgrounds , which is driving the hiring , retainment , and employment of a more diverse workforce. In Europe we are rolling out a framework designed to support the empowerment of women mainly with a HR development program called Women in Leadership (WIL). And in Japan too we are engaged in activities to facilitate networking according to the various attributes of employees. This includes people with a disability , foreign nationals , women , and those who identify as LGBTQ.\n\nIn order to measure the results and progress of these initiatives , we intend to emphasize the positive response rate  in  the  aforementioned  Employee  Opinion  Survey (EOS). In the EOS , the scores in the category of respecting for the individual have improved in recent years , but by steadily propelling DEI initiatives up ahead , we will aim to lift the scores in other categories , particularly employee engagement and employee enablement , from around the global average at present to some of the highest levels in the world.\n\nTrainers that run training sessions in the workplace to educate employees so that employees can be alert for the appearance of unconscious bias. Following an in-house application process , employees who have undergone the prescribed training are then internally certified as an ' ambassador. '\n\n## Favorable response rate in Employee Opinion Survey (EOS) (Panasonic Group)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating safe and secure workplaces\n\nSafety and compliance are the major premises of business management. When it comes to occupational health and safety , we aim to create workplace environments in which employees can work safely and with peace of mind amid growing diversification among the type of people working on the manufacturing sites and how they are employed. We continuously promote equipment safety measures by training employees and making them aware of the Equipment Safety Standards , we guarantee safety during nonstationary operations , and we thoroughly manage the chemical substances we use. As for employee health , as an activity geared towards realizing health management , the Company , labor unions , and health insurance organizations have joined forces to encourage and roll out so-called ' Healthy Panasonic Actions. ' We are raising  awareness  about  such  actions  and  providing opportunities for employees to engage in them , based on the recognition that in particular , adopting appropriate lifestyle habits can boost the health and performance of employees. On top of this , we periodically check the stress levels of individuals and organizations and urge each workplace to make improvements.\n\nAs part of our response to COVID-19 , we were quick to roll out workplace vaccinations in a bid to minimize the risk of infection at work or at home. Thanks to an education campaign led by the CEO and infectious disease experts , approximately 112 , 000 vaccinations have been administered throughout the Panasonic Group.\n\nAlso , with regard to compliance , we are encouraging employees to ensure that they have a correct understanding of relevant laws and regulations pertaining to their business and region and that they know about our global hotline ' EARS ' and how it can be used to detect issues from an early stage and prevent incidents from occurring. We are also stepping up awareness activities aimed at eradicating various forms of harassment in the workplace.\n\nWe are also continuously promoting the diversification of workstyles at our work sites. In Japan we have long encouraged the use of a work-from-home system. Given that COVID-19 has prompted us to adopt new workstyles leveraging the use of IT and digital technology , in April 2021 we set up a remote work system as a new option. The system abolished the premise that employees must always report to work. At this point in time , approximately 15 , 000 people are utilizing this system. At the same time , from the perspective of maintaining the health of employees and boosting their motivation , we are taking extra steps to set up a system for accurately gauging the working hours of employees working remotely and running training sessions to improve the communication skills of organization managers.\n\nAlso , on the issue of human rights , we comply with international norms. But above all , we are strengthening our stance on the prohibition of forced labor at corporations , the prohibition of child labor , the elimination of discrimination , the freedom of association , and the acknowledgement of the right to collective bargaining.",

        "page_content": "## Responsible Procurement Activities\n\nPanasonic currently does business with around 10 , 000 suppliers worldwide , roughly 60% of which are located in Japan and China. Industry-wise , 37% of them supply machined parts. We aim to establish fair , equitable , and sustainable supply chains by realizing co-existence and mutual prosperity with suppliers who can share our values on fulfilling social responsibilities regarding not just economic relationships , but also the environment , CSR , and society. Fulfilling our social responsibilities together with our suppliers is in itself the practical implementation of our management philosophy , and we consider the establishment of sustainable supply chains to be a key initiative if we are to steadily undertake procurement activities in the future and guarantee excellent product quality and competitive prices in order to deliver product value that is acceptable to our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Procurement policy\n\nDriven by the concept that , based on relationships of mutual trust and through diligent study and cooperation , our suppliers are invaluable partners in creating the values our customers demand , Panasonic ' s Procurement Policy revolves around the following three points.\n\n## 1. Implementation of global procurement activities\n\nThe Company globally establishes partnerships with suppliers to respond to production activities on a global scale , and works to create the functions and values our customers demand based on relationships of mutual trust and through diligent studies and cooperation.\n\n## 2. Implementation of CSR procurement\n\nComplying with laws and regulations , social norms , and corporate ethics , the Company promotes procurement activities together with suppliers that fulfill their social responsibilities , such as human rights , labor , safety and health , global environmental conservation , and information security.\n\n## 3.  Procurement activities working closely with suppliers\n\nIn order to achieve product values expected by customers , the Company serves as the contact point of suppliers with respect to information , such as the market trends of materials and goods , new technologies , new materials , and new processes , and works to ensure and maintain the quality of purchased goods , realize competitive prices , and respond to market changes.\n\n## Panasonic Supply Chain CSR Promotion Guidelines\n\nIn March 2016 , the Panasonic Group released the first edition of its Supply Chain CSR Promotion Guidelines (hereafter , ' CSR Guidelines ' ) , a set of CSR requirements the Group requests its suppliers to comply with. The CSR Guidelines reference international benchmarks and standard views in the industry. The CSR Guidelines also communicate the Panasonic Group ' s approach to CSR procurement whilst taking into account the CSR requirements of NGOs and client companies. The second edition was released in July 2018. The Panasonic Group requests all of its suppliers to comply with the CSR Guidelines when commencing transactions.\n\nThe CSR Guidelines prescribe the following.\n\n- 1)   Labor  rights: Prohibition of forced labor or child labor , appropriate  working  hours , decent  wages , humane treatment , elimination of discrimination , and freedom of association\n- 2)  Occupational health and safety: Training to ensure workplace safety and emergency preparedness , safety measures for machinery and equipment , and occupational health and safety rules for facilities\n- 3)   Environment: Compliance with the latest edition of Panasonic ' s Green Procurement Standards\n- 4)   Ethics: Prohibition of corruption and bribery , and promotion of fair business and responsible mineral procurement\n- 5)   Information  security: Prevention of information leaks and protection against computer and network threats\n- 6)  Product quality and safety: Creation of a product quality  management  system , provision  of  accurate product and service data , and maintenance of product safety\n- 7)  Contributions to society: Contributions to society and local communities\n- 8) Management systems",

        "page_content": "## CSR self-assessments\n\nIn  fiscal  year  ended  March  2016  (fiscal  2016)  we started requesting that our suppliers complete a CSR self-assessment based on our CSR Guidelines regarding how they address issues concerning human rights , health and safety , the environment , and ethics. The CSR self-assessment includes items for confirming that the supplier does not engage in child labor or forced labor practices. Panasonic asks its suppliers to hire workers in accordance with the laws and regulations of each country and that workers are not forced to work against their own volition. We prioritize self-assessments in regions where CSR risks are greater; in fiscal 2021 we requested the completion of the  self-assessment  from  new  suppliers  and  approximately 1 , 500 major existing suppliers with whom we continue to do business. If any issues are identified in the CSR self-assessment , we use various methods to urge the supplier in question to make improvements. Also , if necessary , we conduct on-site audits and encourage the supplier to redress the issue. By doing so , we are promoting fair , impartial , and sustainable business transactions. Similarly , up until fiscal 2020 we had visited around 100 companies to conduct on-site audits centering on suppliers in Malaysia and China where risks were considered high in terms of human rights , labor , and the environment. If a supplier is unable to rectify legal violations or other important issues like the prohibition of child labor or forced labor , or in cases where no improvements to other issues can be seen despite ongoing efforts , we will consider the suspension of business transactions. However , given that we consider co-existence and mutual prosperity with our suppliers to be part of our social responsibility , our basic approach is to seek to resolve issues through a process of continual guidance if less urgent issues have been identified.\n\nThe results of CSR self-assessments are also recorded on a common platform and shared throughout the Group. This not only strengthens Group-wide governance , but also lets each business division utilize the results when selecting suppliers.\n\n## Clean procurement\n\nWe are also endeavoring to forge relationships with suppliers  based  on  higher  standards  of  moderation  and ethics by , for example , issuing a Clean Procurement Declaration-which prohibits any employee from accepting money , gifts , entertainment , or meals from suppliersand establishing a global hotline.\n\n## Responsible minerals procurement\n\nPanasonic recognizes that the issue of conflict minerals-such as tin , tantalum , tungsten , gold , and cobaltis a matter of grave concern for society , given the risk that they become the source of funds for armed insurgents in conflict-torn regions and the various risks of child labor and other human rights abuses , harsh working\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconditions , environmental destruction , and corruption in high-risk regions. In order to promote the responsible sourcing of minerals , we participate in the Responsible Minerals Trade Working Group of the Japan Electronics  and  Information  Technology  Industries  Association (JEITA) to raise awareness and improve the efficiency of surveys. Furthermore , since July 2017 we have been a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) , through which we deploy industry-wide initiatives.\n\nMoreover , Panasonic  continues  to  implement  initiatives in line with the Due Diligence Guidance of the Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development (OECD). The Company requires all related suppliers to provide information on smelters/refineries through the supply chain , and aims to procure minerals from smelters/refineries that present no issues. In fiscal 2021 the Company surveyed around 3 , 270 suppliers concerning conflict minerals and collected responses from 95% of them. The Company has confirmed that none of the minerals it sourced from them is financing armed forces either directly or indirectly. There are also concerns about cobalt , which is used in lithium-ion batteries and other products , owing to human rights issues such as child labor at mining sites. Panasonic continually conducts initiatives such as cobalt supply chain surveys and identification and investigation of smelters/refineries. In fiscal 2021 , we conducted cobalt surveys for 474 suppliers and collected responses from 90% of those surveyed.\n\n## Environmental initiatives\n\nPanasonic asks its suppliers to actively engage in global environmental conservation and environmental management and also deliver their goods in accordance with its green procurement policy. We ask our suppliers to reduce their environmental impact by establishing environmental management systems , ensuring comprehensive chemical substance management , lowering GHG emissions , promoting the recycling of resources and water , engaging in biodiversity conservation , sharing results of collaborations (ECO-VC Activity) , and urging upstream suppliers in the supply chain to do the same.\n\nThe ECO-VC Activity recognizes outstanding initiatives and ideas aimed at generating added value. Panasonic , in its procurement activities , works closely with suppliers from the development stage to not only streamline costs , but also reduce CO2 emissions , minimize the total resources used , and utilize recycled resources. The Activity receives around 700 applications on average every year. Through partnerships with suppliers , the Company is helping to mitigate climate change by contributing to the reduction in CO2 emissions.\n\nPanasonic continues to promote responsible procurement and fulfill its social responsibilities together with suppliers. At the same time , by establishing stable and sustainable supply chains , the Company will continue to underpin enhancements in corporate value in the future.",

This was despite increased domestic sales in products such as air purifiers and increased overseas sales in products such as mounting machines at Process Automation , power storage systems for information- and communication-infrastructure as well as industrial-use motors.\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased due to fixed cost reductions for management structure enhancement as well as increased sales for businesses such as air-conditioning and indoor air quality , automotive batteries and information- and communication-infrastructure , which capture business opportunities reflecting changes in society from a medium- to long-term perspective. Operating profit , however , decreased due largely to the impact of gain from business transfer in the previous year in addition to sales decline.\n\nNote:  Adjusted operating profit: sales - cost of sales - SG&A\n\nNet profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders declined as a result of lower operating profit and the dropout of the year-earlier improvement in corporate income taxes owing to tax benefits associated with the reorganization of subsidiaries. As a result , ROE ended the year at 7.2%.\n\nThe Panasonic Group concentrated on development of new technologies and new products to underpin its future based on the growth strategies for the major business fields.

In fiscal 2021 the main capital investments have been made  in  production  facilities  for lithium-ion batteries for automotive use , in production facilities for electronic components and control equipments.\n\nNote:  The figures for ' Capital investment ' are amounts on an accrual basis for property , plant and equipment and intangible assets. (Excludes increases due to business combinations)\n\n' Depreciation and Amortization ' include depreciation of property , plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets.\n\nFree cash flow improved significantly year on year to 680.6 billion yen , mainly due to cash flows from investing activity in the form of proceeds from the establishment of a joint venture in the automotive prismatic battery business as well as transfer of assets.\n\nNote:  Lease receivables collected as a result of application of finance lease accounting as lessor-based on product supply contracts determined to contain leases-are included in cash flows from investing activities. (Lease receivables collected amounted to 6.8 billion yen in fiscal 2021 , 37.2 billion yen in fiscal 2020 , 167.3 billion yen in fiscal 2019 , and 19.3 billion yen in fiscal 2018.)\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31 , 2021 increased by 576.7 billion yen due primarily to the improvement in free cash flow.\n\nInterest-bearing  debt  decreased by 23.9 billion yen. This is due to the repayment of Commercial Paper (CP) and other factors despite the issuance of unsecured straight bonds.\n\nNote:  Interest-bearing debt includes lease liabilities (257.9 billion yen at March 31 , 2021 , 266.9 billion yen at March 31 , 2020).\n\nPanasonic ' s policy is to provide a stable , sustained dividend based on a target consolidated payout ratio of approximately 30%. In fiscal 2021 , Net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stock holders decreased. Reflecting these operating results , in view of this basic policy as well as its current financial position , the annual dividend was set at 20 yen per share for fiscal 2021.\n\nNote:  The dividend payout ratio is not calculated in fiscal years when net income attributable to Panasonic Corporation is negative.",

Total CO2 emissions in fiscal 2021 amounted to 2.11 million tons , while the volume of emissions per net sales had decreased 27% compared to the fiscal year ended March 2014.\n\n## For details:\n\nhttps://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/ sustainability/eco/co2/site.html\n\nOwing to the solar photovoltaic systems newly adopted at our business sites in Japan and Malaysia and the commencement of full-scale operations of existing photovoltaic systems , the amount of in-house renewable energy adoption in this fiscal year reached 35 , 000 MWh. We are steadily making progress towards the fiscal 2022 target of 40 , 000 MWh.\n\n## For details:\n\nhttps://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/ sustainability/eco/co2/site.html\n\nAs part of our recycling-oriented manufacturing approach , we are working to reduce the input of virgin resources and expand our use of recycled resources. In fiscal 2021 we used 15.2 kt of recycled resin in our products by tackling such issues as compatibility with features required for certain components used and the securing of a stable supply. We have now used a total of 28.6 kt since fiscal 2020 and we are making steady progress towards our target of 42 kt or more for the three-year period through fiscal 2022.\n\n## For details:",

The factory waste recycling rate in fiscal 2021 was 98.7% , which was below the target of at least 99%. We will step up our initiatives on recycling waste plastic in an effort to maintain and improve our factory waste recycling rate.\n\n## For details:\n\nhttps://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/ sustainability/eco/resource/\n\nrecycling\\_oriented\\_manufacturing.html\n\nPromoting diversity is one of our key management initiatives and we are cognizant of the fact that there is a pressing need to appoint more women to managerial or responsible positions. As a result of various initiatives , both the number of women in managerial positions and the percentage of women in positions of responsibility are rising year on year at Panasonic.\n\nIn addition to above , in 2021 Panasonic signed on with ' 30% Club Japan ' which aims to raise the proportion of women in the board of directors and other critical decision-making bodies in business. With these efforts , Panasonic aims to further boost diversity in the Group.\n\n## For details:\n\nhttps://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/\n\nsustainability/pdf/sdb2021e-employee.pdf\n\nWe ensure that the Board of Directors possesses a broad cross-section of knowledge , experience , and capabilities as a whole and endeavor to optimize the number of Board members so that the Board ' s functions can be demonstrated effectively and efficiently. Also , to enhance the Board ' s objectivity and neutrality and to strengthen its supervisory function , we adhere to an outside directors ratio of at least one third. As of June 30, 2021 , the Board comprises 13 directors , 46.2% of which hail from outside of the Company.\n\n## For details:\n\nhttps://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/ management/governance.html",

        "page_content": "## Fiscal 2021 Operating Results\n\nSales (Years ended March 31)\n\nSales decreased by 4% to 2 , 494.4 billion yen from a year ago. This is due mainly to the impact of deteriorating market conditions during the first half as well as the impact of streamlining in product lines for TVs and digital cameras , despite continued steady sales in products such as room air-conditioners , refrigerators and washing machines in Japan and China , and other regions saw signs of recovery.\n\nOperating profit increased 48.6 billion yen to 104.3 billion yen from a year ago , as a result of the effect of improved profitability outside Japan and reductions in fixed cost and sales promotion expenses , in addition to solid performance of domestic businesses , especially of the home appliances business.\n\nSales decreased by 21% to 1 , 507.3 billion yen from a year ago , because , in addition to the deconsolidation of the housing related businesses , sales of wiring devices and lighting fixtures decreased in the domestic non-residential market , while overseas sales also declined due to lockdowns in India and Malaysia , despite strong performance of the IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) business.\n\nOperating profit decreased 110.9 billion yen to 69.2 billion yen from a year ago , due to impact of decreased sales resulting from weak overall demand , the recording of restructuring expenses , and the recording of the gain from business transfer of the housing related businesses in the previous fiscal year , despite favorable effects of higher profit from sales in the IAQ business and fixed-cost reduction.\n\nSales decreased by 21% to 818.2 billion yen from a year ago , declining overall because strong sales in the process automation business fell short of offsetting the adverse impact on other businesses of the market downturn caused by the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe segment recorded an operating loss of 20.0 billion yen , 112.0 billion yen down from a year ago , mainly because of the impact of declined sales in such businesses as avionics , the recognition of impairment losses , and the recording of the gain from business transfer of the security systems business in the previous fiscal year.\n\nSales decreased by 10% to 1 , 339.4 billion yen from a year ago. Both the automotive solutions business and the automotive batteries business saw a decline in sales on a full year basis as a result of a significant decrease in automotive production in the first half of the fiscal year due to the spread of COVID-19 , despite a rapid recovery in demand thereafter.\n\nThe segment recorded an operating profit of 10.9 billion yen , 57.5 billion yen up from a year ago , in spite of decreased sales due to the spread of COVID-19 , mainly because the automotive solutions business saw an increase in profit as a result of substantial reduction in fixed costs; the automotive batteries business also saw an increase in profit because of the rationalization of materials for cylindrical lithium-ion batteries and gains from establishment of prismatic lithium-ion batteries joint venture. Furthermore , the automotive cylindrical battery business recorded a profit on a full year basis for the first time since the establishment of the North America factory for batteries.\n\nSales decreased by 2% to 1 , 255.5 billion yen from a year ago. In the main business , sales of industrial motors expanded due to the recovery in demand for production facilities , and sales of capacitors and power storage systems for data centers were strong due to the expansion of data communication demand. Sales of automotive components also recovered in the second half , following the adverse impact of the spread of COVID-19 in the first half of the fiscal year. However , overall sales declined mainly due to the effects of the transfer of the semiconductor business.\n\nOperating profit increased 61.6 billion yen to 66.2 billion yen from a year ago , mainly due to a rebound from the recording of restructuring expenses in the previous fiscal year , in addition to increases in sales and profit of industrial motors , power storage systems , capacitors , etc. , and efforts to reduce fixed costs and promote the rationalization of materials.\n\nOperating Profit (Years ended March 31)\n\n- Adjusted operating profit (reference)\n- \u00b7 Operating profit/sales ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Company ' s financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) until the fiscal year ended March 2016.\n- 2.   In order to be consistent with generally accepted financial reporting practices in Japan , operating profit , a non-GAAP measure , is presented as net sales less cost of sales and selling , general and administrative expenses. The Company believes that this is useful to investors in comparing the Company ' s financial results with those of other Japanese companies. See the Company ' s annual securities report and financial announcements for the details.\n- 3.  The figures for ' Capital investment ' are amounts on an accrual basis for property , plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n- 4. ' Depreciation and amortization ' include depreciation of property , plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets.\n- 5. ' Dividends declared per share ' reflect those declared by Panasonic in each fiscal year and consist of interim dividends paid during the fiscal year and year-end dividends paid after the fiscal year-end.\n- 6.   Exchange rate is the average rate for the fiscal year.\n- 7. ' Diluted net income (loss) attributable to Panasonic Corporation per common share ' from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2014 has been omitted because the Company did not have potential common shares that were outstanding for the period.\n- 8.   Effective from the beginning of fiscal 2013 , investments and depreciation expenses in molding dies are included in ' Capital investment ' and ' Depreciation ,' respectively. Accordingly , the amounts of 'Capital investment' and 'Depreciation and amortization' for fiscal 2012 are changed.\n- 9.   Payout ratios have not been presented for those fiscal years in which the Company incurred a net loss attributable to Panasonic Corporation.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\nPanasonic Corporation and subsidiaries Fiscal year ended March 2021\n\n## Operating Results\n\n## Business Overview\n\nDuring the year ended March 31 , 2021 (fiscal 2021) under review , the global economy saw a decline in consumption and investment due to the prolonged impact of COVID-19. Despite the economic measures taken in various countries and the recovery of share prices , the economic outlook remained difficult to predict , given the growing uncertainties over the political and financial circumstances as well as the risk of trade stagnation. Japan was also affected by these global conditions to no small extent.\n\nUnder such a management environment , the Company has been capturing opportunities reflecting changes in society brought about by COVID-19 and promoting measures for solutions. At the same time , initiatives such as reducing fixed costs have been taken in line with business conditions. In addition , based on the Mid-term strategy started from fiscal 2020 , the Company has steadily continued to promote business portfolio reform and enhance its management structure to break away from a low-profitability structure.\n\nMore specifically , with regard to the investment for growth in the Gemba (operational frontlines) Process business , the Company made a strategic equity investment obtaining 20% of the voting rights in Blue Yonder Holding , Inc. ( ' Blue Yonder ' ) , a U.S.-based specialized supply chain software provider , in July 2020 (Note 1) . Furthermore , in the automotive prismatic battery business , Prime Planet Energy & Solutions , Inc. which is a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corporation , has started its operation since April 1 , 2020. The joint venture is working to develop highly competitive batteries that have excellent quality , performance and cost effectiveness , and to provide a stable supply of batteries. In addition , as a means for improving profitability , the Company has pushed ahead with individual business portfolio reforms with a particular focus on geographical regions and products. For example , the Company has made a decision to transfer shares in its lighting device businesses in Europe and North America.\n\nTo enhance its management structure , the Company has made significant progress on reducing fixed costs , so much so that it achieved the medium-term target of 100.0 billion yen ahead of schedule in fiscal 2021. Also , as a measure for dealing\n\nFinancial Results\n\n(Billions of yen)\n\nwith businesses that have loss-making structures , the Company completed the transfer of its semiconductor business to Nuvoton Technology Corporation , a Taiwan-based semiconductor company in September 2020. Also , in the solar business , for the purpose of optimization in the development and production capability , the Company ceased its U.S. production of photovoltaic cells and modules at the plant in Buffalo (New York , U.S.) in June 2020. The withdrawal was completed in September 2020. Additionally , the Company announced in February 2021 to withdraw from its in-house photovoltaic production for residential , public and industrial-usage during fiscal 2022 (Note 2) .\n\n- Notes 1.  At the Board of Directors ' meeting held on April 23 , 2021 , the Company resolved to acquire additional 80% of the shares of Blue Yonder to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary.\n- 2.  The Company will continue the sales of photovoltaic modules under the Panasonic brand in Japan by subcontracting production to its manufacturing partners. For the global market outside Japan , the Company will also continue to sell outsourced photovoltaic modules as it has been doing in North America and other regions.\n\n## Net Sales\n\n\u0313\n\nThe Company s consolidated group sales for fiscal 2021 decreased by 11% to 6 , 698.8 billion yen from a year ago. Domestic sales decreased due mainly to the impact of the spread of COVID-19 as well as the impact of deconsolidation in housing related businesses , despite increased sales in products such as air purifiers. Overseas sales decreased due largely to the impact of the spread of COVID-19 , despite increased sales in products such as mounting machines at Process Automation , power storage systems for information- and communication-infrastructure as well as industrial-use motors.\n\n## Overview by Geographic Region\n\nBy geographic region , overall sales in Japan decreased by 14% to 3 , 113.3 billion yen. Sales overseas decreased by 8% to 3 , 881.5 billion yen. In real terms , excluding the impact of exchange rates , sales decreased by 7% year on year. In North and South America , sales totaled 1 , 117.1 billion yen , a year-on-year decrease of 20% in real terms. In Europe ,\n\n|                                                               |                                                               | 3/2020    | 3/2021    | vs. 3/2020 %/amount   | vs. 3/2020 %/amount   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Net sales                                                     | Net sales                                                     | 7 , 490.6 | 6 , 698.8 | 89%                   | -791.8                |\n| Adjusted operating profit                                     | Adjusted operating profit                                     | 286.7     | 307.2     | 107%                  | +20.5                 |\n| Operating profit                                              | Operating profit                                              | 293.8     | 258.6     | 88%                   | -35.2                 |\n| Profit before income taxes                                    | Profit before income taxes                                    | 291.1     | 260.8     | 90%                   | -30.3                 |\n| Net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders | Net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders | 225.7     | 165.1     | 73%                   | -60.6                 |\n| ROE                                                           | ROE                                                           | 11.5%     | 7.2%      | -                     | -4.3%                 |\n| Exchange rates                                                | 1 USD                                                         | 109 yen   | 106 yen   |                       |                       |\n| Exchange rates                                                | 1 EUR                                                         | 121 yen   | 124 yen   |                       |                       |\n| Exchange rates                                                | 1 RMB                                                         | 15.6 yen  | 15.7 yen  |                       |                       |",

        "page_content": "## Financial and Corporate Information\n\n## Financial Review\n\n## Profit before Income Taxes\n\nFinance income decreased from 31.4 billion yen the previous fiscal year to 20.8 billion yen. Finance expenses decreased from 34.1 billion yen the previous fiscal year to 18.6 billion yen. As a result , profit before income taxes was 260.8 billion yen , compared to 291.1 billion yen the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Financial Conditions and Liquidity\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Panasonic Group ' s basic policy is to generate necessary funds for its business activities through its own efforts.  The  generated  funds  are  utilized  efficiently through internal Group finance operations. In cases when it becomes necessary to secure funds for purposes such as for working capital or business investments , corporate financing is secured from an external source by appropriate means after due consideration of the Group ' s financial standing and financial market conditions.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31 , 2021 were 1 , 593.2 billion yen , increased by 576.7 billion yen compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. During fiscal 2021 , the Group raised working capital , etc. , mainly by  issuing  Commercial  Papers  (CPs).  The  Group  has secured cash and cash equivalents over one trillion yen as a reserve for risks of aggravating financial economy environments , etc. The Group issues the unsecured straight bonds of 200.0 billion yen in December 2020 and allots redemption flows from the CPs to ensure medium- to long-term financing. As a result , the balance of unsecured straight bonds was 880.0 billion yen , the balance of unsecured USD-denominated straight bonds was USD 2.5 bil-\n\n## Net Profit Attributable to Panasonic Corporation Stockholders\n\nIncome taxes were 76.9 billion yen , compared to 51.0 billion yen a year ago. As a result , net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders totaled 165.1 billion yen , compared to 225.7 billion yen a year ago. Also , net profit attributable to Panasonic Corporation stockholders per share was 70.75 yen , against 96.76 yen the previous fiscal year.\n\nlion as of March 31 , 2021.\n\nInterest-bearing debt decreased to 1 , 447.4 billion yen as of March 31 , 2021 from 1 , 471.3 billion yen at the end of the previous fiscal year. This is due to the repayments of Commercial Paper (CP) and other factors despite the issuance of unsecured straight bonds. Panasonic entered into three-year commitment line agreements (Note) with several banks in June 2018 to prepare for financing risk in the precarious financial and economic environment. The upper limit for unsecured borrowing based on the agreements is a total of 700.0 billion yen , but there is no borrowing under this agreement.\n\nNote:  Commitment line agreements: contracts made with financial institutions to secure financing subject to pre-agreed limits on the time period and commitment line. The contract dated June 2018 recently expired and was therefore renewed in June 2021 for a total of 600.0 billion yen.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nThe Company recognizes the importance of increasing free cash flow by strengthening business profitability and developing businesses over the medium- to long-term. The Company also works simultaneously to create cash flows through continuous reductions of working capital , revisions of asset holdings and other measures.\n\n<!-- image -->",
