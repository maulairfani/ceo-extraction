In doing so, it builds on the disclosures we adopted in 2019/20 in response to new statutory requirements and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.\n\n## Progress through the pandemic\n\nWe can look back on 2020/21 as a year of unprecedented challenge in which SSE delivered on its purpose and consolidated its position as a driving force behind the transition to net zero. In the face of a global pandemic we played our part in 'keeping the lights on', supporting the secure supply of electricity that was needed in the fight against coronavirus. We worked to keep our employees safe and adapted to new ways of working through successive lockdowns without drawing on government support schemes such as furlough or rates relief. I am grateful for the commitment shown by our employees throughout this difficult period. It is thanks to their effort that we have stayed true to our purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow.\n\nThe momentum that has been building behind SSE's strategic evolution in recent years gathered pace in 2020/21. The strategic milestones referred to elsewhere in this report, which include delivery on our capex and disposals programmes, have set us up for continued progress. Growing societal expectations on climate action, and signals of a more supportive policy environment in the UK through the Ten Point Plan and the Energy White Paper, combined with the Climate Action Plan in Ireland and a growing appetite for clean energy internationally, provide an exciting platform for growth at home and abroad.\n\nThe business and operating models described on pages 10 to 13 \uf150 show the clear strategic logic of the Group's structure and business mix. From the synergies of our asset-rich core renewables and networks businesses providing the foundations of an investment-led decarbonised economy; to the well-located sites we have for lowercarbon thermal assets that will provide the system flexibility needed in the transition to net zero; and customer businesses providing valuable routes to market and solutions for\n\nconsumers, we are powering change and creating value for shareholders throughout the net zero value chain.\n\nIn addition to coronavirus, 2020/21 presented other challenges for SSE to deal with, including Brexit and the resulting uncertainty over an Emissions Trading System agreement, as well as adverse weather which tested the resilience of our distribution networks.\n\nWe also sought agreement with Ofgem on a fair transmission price control settlement that needed to balance low costs for consumers with delivering net zero. In our view we managed to get that balance broadly right in terms of the overall investment levels in the settlement, but we had to agree to disagree on some of the technical financial parameters. Put simply, we do not believe they are commensurate with the level of investment risk. We asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to review this, but in the meantime we set about delivering the projects in our ambitious RIIO-T2 business plan.\n\nOur financial performance for the year showed how our robust business mix and the quality of our assets helped limit the impact of coronavirus on SSE, although clearly we were not entirely immune. Our results reflected a period of significant operational delivery and strategic progress. We are well set financially for the future with world-class assets, a strong financial position and valuable growth options. Looking ahead, the opportunities presented by the transition to net zero put us in a strong position to create lasting value for shareholders.\n\n## Purpose and strategic focus\n\nThrough delivery of our purpose we are directly addressing the pressing issue of the transition to net zero and reflecting society's shifting priorities on climate change. It is a purpose that has proved resilient over the past year and as we\n\nemerge from the pandemic it takes on even greater importance, resonating with the public momentum that has grown behind a green economic recovery.\n\nMeeting this purpose through a net zerofocused strategy of developing, building, operating and investing in electricity infrastructure and businesses ensures we are fully contributing to that green recovery. And we are putting our money where our mouth is, too, by taking more than \u00a310bn of low-carbon projects to financial close since March 2020. The drive to decarbonise and electrify the economy presents opportunities for us and creates value for our immediate stakeholders and society more widely as investment stimulates the economy, creates green jobs and helps regions often far away from traditional financial centres.\n\nMany of the key Board deliberations in 2020/21 outlined from page 108 \uf150 related to achieving the best outcomes for our businesses, with progress made on growing our renewables pipeline at home and abroad, securing fair price control settlements for our regulated electricity networks and advancing lower-carbon thermal technologies.\n\nThose decisions, their implementation by the executive management team and execution by our highly-skilled employees have all contributed to the strategic progress which, as described in the Chief Executive's review on page 6 \uf150 , is transforming the energy sector.\n\n## Global goals, local consequences\n\nWe place our strategy firmly within a wider global context, with delivery measured against goals that are set out on page 14 \uf150 and directly aligned to four of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals on: climate action; affordable and clean energy; industry, innovation and infrastructure; and decent work and economic growth.",

It is a purpose that has proved resilient over the past year and as we emerge from the pandemic it takes on even greater importance.'\n\nThe focus on strategic delivery was sharpened in October 2020 with the Board's commitment to an ambition to achieve net zero emissions (both direct and indirect) across all of our operations by 2050. This was further underlined when SSE was asked to be a Principal Partner at COP26, which aligns with our well-established Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials and decarbonising strategy.\n\nWe see COP26 as an important opportunity to accelerate climate policy further as countries take the practical steps required to deliver on increasing levels of ambition. Also this year we became signatories to the Race to Zero campaign and signed up to a science-based target aligned to the 2016 Paris Agreement, which seeks a well-below 2\u00b0C global warming trajectory while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAchieving net zero will mean some fundamental changes right across our economy and society. This change will create an abundance of opportunities for increased efficiency and economic prosperity, but is unlikely to benefit everyone equally. Without active intervention by and collaboration between regulators, governments, companies and others, there is a risk that the benefits of the energy transition are concentrated in some groups and that the costs unfairly impact others. We are alive to this risk and committed to fully playing our part in mitigating it.\n\nWe became the first company, to our knowledge, to publish a Just Transition strategy ( see page 45 \uf150 ) outlining the\n\nkey principles we will apply. But we can't do it alone. We are actively seeking to collaborate on our strategy and we believe it is to the benefit of both the Company and its shareholders if there is enhanced engagement on climate-related matters. That is why the Board is proposing an enabling resolution to its 2021 Annual General Meeting that establishes a framework for an annual vote on SSE's Net Zero Transition report at future AGMs. We look forward to discussing this with shareholders and stakeholders in due course.\n\nStretching carbon targets. Investment in clean infrastructure. Economic contribution through the payment of Fair Tax and support of supply chains. Job creation and payment of the Living Wage. These are all examples of our purpose at work and our strategy in action. Together they build a compelling picture of SSE's ESG commitment and reflect a healthy business culture that is informed by the needs of our stakeholders.\n\n## A healthy business culture\n\nThe transparency of the disclosures made in this report speaks to a culture we describe simply as 'Doing the Right Thing'. It is this ethos that runs beneath our purpose, vision and strategy, and it is guided by a long-established set of core values, defined as Safety, Service, Efficiency, Sustainability, Excellence and Teamwork. Given the sometimes hazardous nature of our operations, Safety is regarded as our No. 1 value and promotion and measurement of it is given the highest priority right across the Group.\n\nThe values also form the basis of a code of ethical business conduct that considers the interests of all of SSE's stakeholders, and the importance of respectful relationships with them. The code, in the form of a 'Doing the Right Thing Guide' was updated and republished in 2020 to help employees when faced with difficult ethical judgements.\n\nHaving succeeded Richard Gillingwater as Chair on 1 April 2021, I am grateful to him for leaving behind a Board of the size, stature and technical expertise that befits SSE's place in a highly complex, critical sector. We must now be alert to the societal changes that will surely come in a post-pandemic world. This will mean working with my fellow Directors in adapting our strategies and evolving our governance structures to ensure we continue to be successful in promoting SSE's long-term success.\n\n## Working with stakeholders\n\nA key function of this Annual Report is to aid understanding of how my fellow Directors and I have exercised our duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the long-term success of SSE with consideration to the views of all stakeholders.\n\nSustainable businesses do not operate in a vacuum; they create prosperity, they meet wider societal needs and they maintain trusted relationships with stakeholders. With this in mind, we are clear that SSE's strategy is actively meeting our social contract and our purpose is one that is ultimately seeking profitable solutions to the problems faced by people and our planet.\n\nWhile Section 172 and our stakeholder interactions have been a long-standing feature of SSE's corporate reporting, our disclosure on material stakeholder issues is elevated further for 2020/21 with a standalone Section 172 Statement on page 92 \uf150 . This statement, the accompanying Non-Financial Reporting matrix, on page 93 \uf150 , and the Sustainability Report 2021 combine to demonstrate the totality of economic, social and environmental value created by SSE in 2020/21.\n\nThis Strategic Report and the associated Section 172 Statement on page 92 \uf150 have been approved by the Board in line with the Companies Act 2006. As always, we welcome feedback on the report or the matters covered within it as we continue to take the Company forward, power positive change and build a better world of energy.\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair, SSE plc 25 May 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW\n\n## POWERING CHANGE ON THE ROAD TO NET ZERO\n\nSSE's Chief Executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, leads development of SSE's strategy and its execution, as agreed by the Board. He chairs the Group Executive Committee, and is the lead Executive Director for central functions such as human resources, sustainability, corporate affairs and strategy. He provides his reflections on a year of unprecedented challenge and outlines the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.\n\n## Safety is more important to SSE than ever\u2026\n\nThe social and economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic is a reminder, should we need it, that the most important job we all have as SSE employees is to take care of our colleagues, customers and communities. Every SSE employee is empowered with the safety 'licence': if it's not safe, we don't do it.\n\nAfter achieving our best ever year of safety performance in 2019/20, we built on this in 2020/21, further reducing our Total Recordable Incident Rate. In simple terms, that means fewer people were hurt - 47 down from 55 the previous year - and 271 'safe days' achieved where no injury, environmental breach, serious road traffic accident or high-potential incident occurred. In a year when the world was reevaluating its own safety policies, our well practised procedures proved adaptable for safe working during the pandemic.\n\n## Our employees played their part in fighting coronavirus\u2026\n\nDuring what has been a very uncertain year, we've continued to be guided by our purpose: to provide energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. This twin focus on the present and the future has characterised 2020/21 for SSE.\n\nVery early on in the pandemic we were clear that our first priority was to support the safe and reliable supply of electricity to those who needed it, particularly those tackling coronavirus on the front lines and I am very proud of my colleagues right across the business, but particularly those working out in the field, for the flexibility, resilience and hard work that has enabled us to do this.\n\nTo support employees through the pandemic we implemented measures to enable homeworking for non-operational\n\nstaff and adopted a 'flexible first' approach to help people balance radically altered work and home life patterns, including offering additional paid leave for those with caring responsibilities.\n\n## We're leading the debate on driving a green recovery\u2026\n\nAt the same time, we recognised that there would be a need to drive economic recovery from the impacts of coronavirus, and that investment in low-carbon infrastructure could deliver a 'win-win'; helping to tackle climate change while creating jobs and stimulating economies.\n\nIn May, we published our ' Greenprint for building a cleaner, more resilient economy' , which formed the basis for a year of constructive engagement with government, the regulator and industry bodies. We were therefore pleased to see the Government signal its climate action intentions in the form of the Prime Minister's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, including the ambition for enough offshore wind to power every home by 2030, and the long-awaited Energy White Paper.\n\n## And we are putting our money where our mouth is\u2026\n\nWe set out in June our plans to invest \u00a37.5bn over a five-year period, predominantly in low-carbon infrastructure, and have made great progress on each of our flagship renewables projects. At Dogger Bank, we are building the world's largest offshore wind farm with our joint venture partners Equinor (40%), as well as Eni (20%).\n\nThe potential for Dogger Bank to create jobs and reinvigorate the north east was underlined by GE's decision to invest in a new turbine blade factory in Teesside - on the strength of the significant orders from Dogger Bank. Construction work is well under way at Seagreen, Scotland's largest\n\noffshore wind farm and the world's deepest, and at Viking, which will be one of Europe's highest-yielding onshore wind farms. Taken together these projects have already created well in excess of 1,000 skilled, green jobs and will continue to do so.\n\n## There are growth opportunities for us internationally\u2026\n\nWe have a strong track record as a renewables developer in the UK and Ireland, and an enviable pipeline of future projects that will enable us to meet our target of trebling our renewables output by 2030. However, we see more opportunities for growth in renewables and have set out our aspiration to reach a run rate of at least 1GW of new assets a year during the second half of the decade.\n\nPart of that will entail identifying options to bring our expertise to international markets where we see value, and we took a first step towards that when we announced plans to form a 50/50 joint venture partnership with Acciona S.A., a leading Spanish renewables developer, to enter the emerging Spanish and Portuguese offshore wind markets. We are also partnering with CIP and Danish energy company Andel Holding on the tender process in Denmark to develop the 800-1,000MW Thor wind farm off the country's west coast.\n\n## We're building a 'Transmission Network for Net Zero'\u2026\n\nIt's clear that the UK Government's offshore wind ambitions can only be realised if there is sufficient investment in the transmission network to connect it all and transport the output to where it's needed. As we now enter the RIIO-T2 price control period, we are already getting on with delivering the network upgrades required to enable delivery of net zero. While we appealed Ofgem's final determination to the CMA on a narrow range of technical points, we are absolutely committed to delivering on our plan and see a strong case for additional",

That means distribution networks have a critical role to play and the next price control period between 2023 and 2028, RIIO-ED2, is key to unlocking the strategic, anticipatory investment required to deliver the resilience, flexibility and responsiveness we will need.\n\nWe've consulted extensively with all stakeholders to build a robust and compelling business plan and are excited about the role we can play in the transformation journey that lies ahead.\n\n## Refocusing thermal generation for a net zero world\u2026\n\nAs variable renewable electricity increasingly dominates the electricity systems in the UK and Ireland, SSE Thermal's fleet played an important role last year securing electricity supplies for homes and businesses when the wind did not blow and the sun did not shine.\n\nGas-fired electricity will continue to have a role to play for some years yet in any credible net zero pathway, but we don't envisage running any of the fleet unabated into the 2030s and have a clear ambition to decarbonise through pioneering carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen technologies.\n\nSSE Thermal's generation plant are located in places of strategic importance to the electricity system with good proximity to industrial clusters and access to transport\n\n'Our vision is to be a leading energy company in a net zero world. Our core renewables and networks businesses, as well as our complementary businesses in thermal, distributed energy and customer solutions, all have important roles to play in delivering that vision.'\n\nand storage infrastructure. Examples of this can be seen in Aberdeenshire and in the Humber where, with Equinor, we have plans to jointly develop pioneering power stations with CCS technology, and what could be the world's first major 100% hydrogenfuelled plant.\n\nConstruction of Keadby 2, meanwhile, is progressing well and it will be the most efficient gas plant in Europe providing a much-needed capacity boost and displacing less carbon efficient generation on the system; however, we are clear this will be the last unabated CCGT plant we build and we are already looking at options for hydrogen blending there.\n\n## Disposals have sharpened the focus on our net zero vision\u2026\n\nOur vision is to be a leading energy company in a net zero world. Our core renewables and networks businesses, as well as our complementary businesses in thermal, distributed energy and customer solutions, all have important roles to play in delivering that vision. Our business mix is very deliberate, highly effective, fully focused and well set to prosper on the journey to decarbonisation.\n\nWe've made great progress with our \u00a32bn disposals programme, recycling capital from non-core assets less aligned with our vision that will help to fund growth opportunities in our core businesses and sharpen our net zero focus.\n\nThat programme continues, with agreement reached in April to sell our Contracting business and the prospective\n\nsale of our stake in SGN set to be our next material disposal ( see page 16 \uf150 ).\n\n## What we do matters and we're privileged to do it\u2026\n\nAbove all, developments this year underline the importance of our work to provide energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. We are delighted to be a Principal Partner of the UK Government as it prepares to host world leaders at the pivotal COP26 UN climate summit being held in Glasgow in November.\n\nWith the eyes of the world on the UK, it is a reminder that the work we are doing to decarbonise our economy and tackle climate change is vitally important - and our role in this puts us in a privileged position.\n\nWe are working hard to showcase the best the UK has to offer and engaging with a wide range of stakeholders to share our experience on the decarbonisation journey so far. There is a long way to go to deliver net zero in the next three decades - but with our clear strategic focus and expertise in low-carbon assets and infrastructure, we are extremely well placed to play an important part in this effort and create long-term value for shareholders and society along the way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlistair Phillips-Davies Chief Executive 25 May 2021",

These 2030 targets provide important interim milestones on the journey to net zero in 2050. Good progress was made in 2020/21 towards the achievement of these aspirations.\n\n## Cut carbon intensity by 60%\n\n## Treble renewable energy output\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE made important strategic progress in 2020/21 towards achievement of its science-based 2030 goal to cut by 60% the carbon intensity of electricity generated.\n\nWith construction under way on three large-scale wind farms and the rationalisation of SSE's higher-carbon activities, SSE's transition to net zero continues apace.\n\nSSE's last coal plant ceased operation on 31 March 2020, meaning that 2020/21 represented the first year since 2005 that SSE's generation fleet contained no electricity output from coal. Carbon intensity of electricity generated in the year was the lowest since SSE's records began. Nevertheless, more carbon reduction progress is still to be made and SSE is progressing plans with Equinor to develop carbon capture and storage generation plant at Keadby in Humberside and Peterhead in northeast Scotland, as well as what could be the world's first hydrogen-fired power station at Keadby.\n\nIn the short term, the carbon intensity of electricity generated by SSE reduced by around 11% compared to the previous year, a decrease of over 16% from the 2017/18 baseline. Year-to-year variation is to be expected based on external factors, however the long-term trajectory is clear.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGood progress made in 2020/21 on the development and construction of wind farms, despite the operational challenges posed by coronavirus, gives SSE confidence that it will exceed its target of trebling renewable energy output by 2030 compared to a 2017/18 baseline.\n\nFinal investment decisions taken on projects in early 2020/21, and ongoing construction, mean SSE is now building more offshore wind than any other company in the world. SSE reached a final investment decision (FID) on Dogger Bank A and B offshore wind farms (with Dogger Bank C aiming to reach financial close later this calendar year), Seagreen, and Viking in Shetland. These projects will be, respectively, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, the largest offshore wind farm in Scotland and one of the highest-yielding onshore wind farms in Europe. Further progress was made on several other renewable projects over the year, see pages 17 and 19 \uf150 for further detail.\n\nWhile renewable energy output decreased between 2019/20 and 2020/21, from 11,442GWh to 10,242GWh, due to unfavourable weather conditions across both wind and hydro, 2020/21 represented an increase of 4% compared to the 2017/18 baseline.",

The stake equated to 92MW of capacity.\n- \u00b7 Also in September, SSE agreed to sell its 33% equity share in meter asset provider MapleCo to Equitix, receiving a total consideration of \u00a395m.\n- \u00b7 In October, SSE entered into an agreement to sell its 50% share in energy-from-waste ventures Multifuel\n\nEnergy Limited (MEL1) and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (MEL2) to European Diversified Infrastructure Fund III, an infrastructure fund managed by First Sentier Investors, for a total cash consideration of \u00a3995m.\n\n- \u00b7 In December, the Company agreed to sell all of its interests in its portfolio of gas exploration and production (E&P) assets to Viaro Energy via its subsidiary RockRose Energy Limited for a total consideration of \u00a3120m. This transaction, subject to regulatory approval and partner consent, is expected to be complete by the end of the 2021 calendar year.\n- \u00b7 And the 2020/21 financial year opened with the sale of SSE's Contracting business to Aurelius Group on 1 April at an enterprise value of \u00a327.5m. As part of this transaction some 2,000 former SSE employees were transferred over to a new contracting business that is expected to have good growth prospects.\n\nCash proceeds from these transactions will total over \u00a31.5bn, representing considerable progress. SSE's next material disposal will be the future divestment of SSE's 33.3% non-operating financial interest\n\nin SGN. In light of market developments, and in consideration of the RIIO-G2 price control referral to the CMA, in March 2021 SSE stated its intention to divest all of its equity stake in SGN. It now expects to commence a formal sale process in mid-summer 2021, with the intention of having an agreed sale by the end of the calendar year.\n\nThe progress of the disposals programme underlines SSE's commitment to achieving its vision of being a leading energy company in a net zero world. It leaves the Group's business mix more focused on developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity assets and businesses needed in the transition to net zero, with the proceeds helping directly to support investment in these assets.\n\nCASH PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSALS AGREED SINCE THE START OF 2020/21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a31.5bn",

SSE has engaged with key officials in the UK, Ireland and European Commission to showcase the benefits of putting renewables at the heart of net zero. This has involved constructive engagement on barriers to reaching the UK's 40GW offshore wind by 2030 target, urging the Irish Government to re-commit to delivering 1GW of new offshore wind by 2025 in the Irish Sea, and discussions on the European Offshore Renewable Strategy.\n\nConstruction is under way for what will be the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank and SSE has used its position as a leader in the offshore wind sector to support the development of a UK supply\n\nchain, create substantial local jobs and maximise UK supply chain opportunities.\n\nIn September 2020, SSE Renewables announced that the Dogger Bank joint venture would become the first offshore wind farm in the world to install the innovative 13MW GE Haliade-X turbines. Six months later, Dogger Bank was the anchor project for GE's new blade manufacturing plant in Teesside, creating 750 new green jobs. Aberdeen's North Star Renewables was also awarded contracts worth an estimated \u00a3270m to design and deliver the service vessel fleet for Dogger Bank.\n\nCoire Glas, the UK's largest planned pumped hydro storage scheme, was granted revised consent by the Scottish Government in October 2020, marking another step towards helping Scotland and the UK deliver their net zero ambitions. In February 2021, a study by independent researchers from Imperial College London found that just 4.5GW of new long duration pumped hydro storage with 90GWh of storage could save up to \u00a3690m per year in energy system costs by 2050.\n\nIn the Energy White Paper, the UK Government stated that long-duration storage technologies like pumped hydro\n\nstorage would play an essential role in decarbonising the UK's electricity supply by integrating renewable energy and maintaining security of supply.\n\nWith many countries setting out increasingly ambitious climate change targets, the market for renewables globally is growing rapidly and SSE continues to develop options for exporting its long-held renewables expertise to new geographies. In February 2021, SSE Renewables and Acciona S.A., a leading Spanish renewable energy developer, owner and operator, announced plans to form a 50/50 joint venture to enter the emerging Spanish and Portuguese offshore wind markets.\n\nMeanwhile, SSE Renewables is partnering with CIP and Danish energy company Andel Holding on the tender process in Denmark to develop the 800-1,000MW Thor wind farm off the country's west coast. Elsewhere, North West Europe and North America have wind potential onshore and offshore, whilst Japanese offshore wind is of interest, too.\n\nEmerging international options present undoubted opportunities to diversify SSE's pipeline; however, capital discipline will continue to guide investment decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the next decade, Britain wants to quadruple its offshore wind capacity to 40GW, enough to power every home, and boost jobs in the sector.\n\nMeanwhile, SSE has engaged positively with stakeholders in Westminster and Holyrood regarding the role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in reaching net zero and is actively participating in the UK Government's process to develop pilot projects within industrial clusters. The UK Government wants to see four CCS clusters in the UK by 2030 and intends to work with industry to generate 5GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030.\n\nSSE has put forward the case that CCS and hydrogen can provide vital flexible lowcarbon power to help balance a renewablesled system in the transition to net zero, bridging emerging capacity gaps this decade as coal and older gas stations come to the end of their lives, and enabling wider decarbonisation and economic growth in key industrial regions across the UK.\n\nMeanwhile SSE has called for an acceleration of the decarbonisation of transport and promotion of EV take-up by ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030. It therefore welcomed the UK Government's decision in December 2020 to set a 2030 end date, backed up by a \u00a32.8bn support package for the automotive sector. Since this announcement, a number of leading car manufacturers have confirmed they will be fully electric by 2030.\n\nThis increased ambition opens further opportunities for SSE Enterprise and SSEN Distribution, which are facilitating the electrification of transport and heat at the heart of their business plans. Distribution networks will have a critical role in accommodating the charging points required for EVs that can make the UK's net zero ambition a reality.\n\n'The publication of SSE's Greenprint for building a cleaner, more resilient economy formed the basis of constructive engagement with political stakeholders.'",

Through SSE Renewables, in 2020/21 SSE continued its established approach to partnering to capitalise on the significant development opportunities ahead related to net zero.\n\nIn December, SSE entered into an agreement to sell a 10% stake in the first two phases of Dogger Bank wind farm to Eni for an equity consideration of \u00a3202.5m, subject to adjustments for interest on closing - with the proceeds to be used to enable delivery of its low-carbon growth plans. This transaction leaves a Dogger Bank A and B ownership structure of SSE 40%, Equinor 40% and Eni 20%.\n\nThe rationale for strategic partnering of this nature is strong. SSE is well placed to\n\nmanage development risk; but selling down stakes to retain typically 30-40% equity interest in a project and working with equity partners for construction, and/or operation, brings a number of benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 It allows SSE to secure developer premiums and realise value at the earliest opportunity.\n- \u00b7 It reduces overall risk and financial exposure on large-scale projects.\n- \u00b7 It avoids a large increase in net debt that is not earning.\n- \u00b7 It enables SSE to bring in partners with complementary skills and access new markets and technologies.\n- \u00b7 It appeals to the different risk appetites of different partners at different stages of the project cycle.\n\nThis approach to partnering and financing in Renewables provides further optionality to ensure SSE's enviable development pipeline is optimised. Delivering the current pipeline will add, on average, over 500MW of renewables capacity each year to 2030.\n\nIn addition, with upcoming seabed auctions and the work being done to identify opportunities to expand the portfolio internationally, SSE has clear aspirations\n\nto reach a run rate of at least 1GW of new assets a year during the second half of this decade, which will support government ambitions on net zero.\n\nSSE also reiterated that it will consider extending the partnering approach to stakes in its core SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution businesses over the medium term, should it consider that the released capital could facilitate the realisation of greater growth opportunities across its core businesses.\n\nThese would be minority stakes, enabling SSE to retain the lead role in relation to governance and also operational control. And any partnership would only be entered into if it was deemed to be in the interests of customers, the electricity system as a whole, and shareholders to do so.\n\nSSE ASPIRES TO REACH A YEARLY RUN RATE OF NEW ASSETS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE DECADE OF AT LEAST\n\n1GW\n\n<!-- image -->",

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the carbon emissions associated with this progressively. And progress is being made on that front: in 2020/21, carbon emissions associated with SSE's thermal fleet reached the lowest level since SSE records began.\n\nWhile some companies simply choose to sell their unabated plant, that does nothing to address the underlying challenge of finding low-carbon ways to generate electricity flexibly.\n\nAchieving net zero cost-effectively will require a transition from unabated to ultra low-carbon gas-fired generation. This is expected to involve carbon capture and storage (CCS) and, in the longer\n\nterm, widespread use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel to hydrocarbons. Both technologies have been identified as necessary for meeting net zero by the Committee on Climate Change and in National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios.\n\nIn terms of SSE's thermal plant, with the exception of Keadby 2, Marchwood and Great Island, SSE cannot envisage any of the fleet running into the 2030s unabated. Instead, the focus is on developing the flexible but ultra low-carbon solutions needed in a net zero world, capitalising on both SSE's considerable engineering capabilities and the excellent locations of SSE's sites close to emerging transport and storage infrastructure.\n\nIn April 2021, SSE announced a new partnership with Equinor to jointly develop two first-of-a-kind power stations in North Lincolnshire: Keadby CCS and Keadby Hydrogen, which could be the world's first 100% hydrogen-fuelled power station. And in May, SSE and Equinor announced a similar partnership to develop a further cutting-edge CCS power station at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. These would be key projects in the Humber and northeast Scotland clusters, and are well located to underpin emerging transport and\n\nstorage infrastructure, which in can in turn support broader industrial decarbonisation.\n\nThe announcement followed significant steps forward in the development of SSE's own plans for the projects through 2020/21, with progress made on applications for development consents for both Keadby CCS and Peterhead CCS.\n\nUltimately these projects will require supportive policy mechanisms to be put in place and the UK Government has set out a framework for delivering investment within industrial clusters which is expected to progress at pace during 2021/22. With initial successful clusters and capture projects expected to be identified by November, SSE, alongside others in the industry, is continuing to engage on its projects with the UK Government as it looks to demonstrate international leadership through its domestic decarbonisation agenda ahead of COP26.\n\n'Dispatchable power is a fundamental requirement of a renewables-led system.\"",

The plan, A Network for Net Zero , covers the period from April 2021 to March 2026. Similarly, SSEN Distribution is building a business plan to submit to Ofgem for RIIO-ED2, the next electricity distribution price control period, which will run from 2023-2028.\n\nIn order to develop its objectives, SSEN Transmission worked closely with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocacy agencies such as Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland, to ensure delivery of a responsible and sustainable business plan that was reflective of the current and future needs of customers and GB consumers.\n\nThis was led by a thorough action plan and set out how SSEN Transmission plans to engage with stakeholders. It described key engagement principles and mapped the multiple stakeholders that use or have an interest in the business' strategy and objectives, such as but not limited to generation customers, the supply chain, consumer groups, and communities who host SSEN Transmission's infrastructure.\n\nBased on feedback received, the final plan aimed to support both the UK and Scottish Governments' net zero emissions targets and meet the needs and expectations expressed by stakeholders through five clear, ambitious goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Transport the renewable electricity that powers 10m homes.\n- \u00b7 Aim for 100% transmission network reliability for homes and businesses.\n- \u00b7 Every connection delivered on time.\n- \u00b7 One third reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n- \u00b7 \u00a3100m in efficiency savings from innovation.\n\nIn delivering this plan, SSEN Transmission recognises the importance of creating benefit to society through a Just Transition. While its first priority is safely to deliver a robust, efficient and reliable network to customers in the North of Scotland. In delivering this essential service, SSEN Transmission also has a responsibility to customers, employees, communities and shareholders to ensure this need is met in the most responsible way possible.\n\nIn February 2021, SSEN Distribution published its Blueprint for RIIO-ED2, Shaping a sustainable energy future .\n\nThis document helped provide stakeholders with a solid platform of understanding from which it could explore specific challenges, topics, or regional issues that may be of interest. A microsite was also developed, while a variety of events were held with stakeholders, both at a local and a national level.\n\nThe development of SSEN's ED2 plan has been a continuous conversation and it will oversee a critical period as the network responds to dramatic increases in electric vehicles and electric heat demand in line with government policy. Working with consultants Regen and local stakeholders, SSEN Distribution projections show an 'in area' increase of EVs and heat pumps from circa 30K each today to 5m and 2.5m respectively by 2050. Stakeholders' views are critical and with the draft business plan submitted this summer, there will be further in-depth consultation to fine tune the plan over the remainder of 2021.\n\nSSEN TRANSMISSION'S RIIO/hyphen.caseT2 BUSINESS PLAN AIMS FOR EFFICIENCY SAVINGS OF\n\n\u00a3100m\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is now a need to move from ambition to action.\n\nSSE is proud to be a Principal Partner of COP26. It will be the most important climate summit since COP21 and critical for global action on climate change. In September 2020, China joined a growing number of countries in adopting a midcentury net zero goal, and Joe Biden's electoral victory ensured that the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, with his climate envoy, John Kerry, calling COP26 the 'last best chance' to avert a climate catastrophe. If the summit is to be a success, these declarations must be translated into deliverable climate action plans.\n\nLate 2020 saw a significant number of energy and climate policy announcements in both the UK and Ireland. In November,\n\nthe UK Prime Minister published his Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution setting out plans to quadruple the UK's offshore wind capacity and deliver 5GW of hydrogen production capacity by 2030. This was followed in December by the Energy White Paper which set the direction of travel for UK energy policy, and subsequently, the publication of the Climate Change Committee's Sixth Carbon Budget analysis.\n\nIn the US, the Biden Administration has committed to a Plan for Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice which proposes ensuring the US achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net zero emissions no later than 2050. There have also been significant policy developments in the European Union, including the pathway to climate neutrality by 2050. Last year, the European Commission published strategies on energy system integration, hydrogen\n\nand offshore renewable energy. And in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a political agreement was reached on a \u20ac672.5bn Recovery and Resilience Fund, of which a minimum of 37% should support climate objectives.\n\nSSE finds itself firmly on the right side of the climate argument, with a net zero-focused strategy that is playing a major role in decarbonising the economy and creating lasting value for shareholders and society.\n\nChief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies and Group Energy and Commercial Director Martin Pibworth mark SSE's Principal Partnership of COP26.\n\n<!-- image -->",

According to 2021 data from the European Fund and Asset Management Association, in Europe, net assets in ESG funds grew to \u20ac1.2 trillion in 2020, up 37.1% from 2019 and compared to a 4.8% increase for non-ESG funds. Renewable energy funds saw the highest growth - 604% - since 2016.\n\nIt appears that coronavirus has redirected the focus of investors and led to greater scrutiny of businesses' ESG credentials. Understandably, there has been heightened\n\ninvestor focus on social factors such as employee welfare, supply chain issues and the wider societal benefits generated by job creation.\n\nIn the UK, European Union and US, rhetoric around a green recovery has been backed up by credible policy changes, or comprehensive stimulus plans with a climate focus. Amid an increase in capital flow to ESG funds, fund managers are taking increasingly proactive stances on climate risk.\n\nThis is significant at a time when the European Union is seeking to implement the EU Taxonomy to direct capital flows towards green activities and scale up sustainable investment. In November 2020, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the UK would also create\n\n## Innovation and technology\n\n## TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM\n\nAdvances in technology, larger turbine capacities and efficient financing have made wind power one of the cheapest forms of power generation in many countries.\n\nSSE Renewables is showcasing such technologies on projects like its Dogger Bank joint venture where the groundbreaking 13MW GE Haliade-X turbine, the most powerful offshore wind turbine in operation today, is being debuted.\n\nThe key role for flexible low-carbon thermal generation in the transition to net zero is also becoming clear due to its ability to decarbonise multiple sectors. The Prime Minister's Ten Point Plan included a commitment to deploy two carbon capture clusters by the mid-2020s, and a further two clusters by 2030.\n\nThermal power stations with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology or fired by hydrogen will be a cost-effective way of meeting growing peak and seasonal electricity demands. The UK can be a global leader in low-carbon thermal with its existing gas infrastructure and skills and making use of its potential storage capacity in the North Sea.\n\nAdditionally, fast reductions in battery costs are improving the outlook for EVs. Rapid innovation in battery storage technology has seen costs plummet almost 90% since 2010.\n\nIn electricity networks, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology is increasing the capacity, cost effectiveness and distances covered by transmission infrastructure, which is, in turn, improving the viability of offshore and remote sources of renewables.\n\na new green investment taxonomy and become the first country in the world to make TCFD-aligned disclosures fully mandatory across the economy by 2025.\n\nSSE has reported in line with the TCFD framework since 2020 ( see pages 40 and 41 \uf150 ) and looks forward to disclosing material issues that align with the UK's proposed green taxonomy when the requirements are known.\n\nNET ASSETS IN EUROPEAN ESG FUNDS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u20ac1.2tr\n\nIn all of this, SSE applies an innovation strategy that has at its core a philosophy of partnering with sector specialists in order to gain access to the technologies, experience and skills that its individual businesses need to help them accelerate projects in support of net zero.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Welcome efforts by the UK Government to address market design continue against the backdrop of events in 2020/21, which demonstrate the rapid pace at which the sector is evolving.\n\nIn February 2021, the Crown Estate announced the results of Offshore Wind Leasing Round 4 with six proposed new offshore wind projects in England and Wales. The successful bids represented record high levels for seabed, signalling the attractiveness of UK offshore development. While unsuccessful in this round, SSE continues to hold the largest offshore wind development pipeline in the UK and Republic of Ireland at 7GW - and the value of these options is now clearer than ever.\n\nThe UK's target for 40GW of offshore wind by 2030 is a challenge that will require an equally ambitious approach to seabed auctions. Both RenewableUK and WindEurope have shared their concerns regarding the auction process, noting\n\nthat insufficient sites were made available to meet demand while the record high bids involved will result in greater costs for developers and ultimately consumers. High demand is driven in part by oil majors seeking to diversify their portfolios, with more than 55% of Round 4 capacity won by oil major-backed consortia.\n\nIf consumers and developers alike are to reap the benefits of the booming offshore wind market, then a coordinated approach to developing the required amount of offshore grid infrastructure will be crucial. In August 2020, BEIS and Ofgem initiated the Offshore Transmission Network Review with workstreams reviewing near-, medium- and long-term opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes provisions for cooperation in the development of offshore energy, with a focus on the North Sea, while the European Commission has proposed a framework under the revised TEN-E Regulation for long-term offshore grid planning, involving regulators and the Member States in each sea basin.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSEN Transmission, meanwhile, was greatly encouraged by the broad support for its stakeholder-led business plan throughout Ofgem's consultative process on its Draft Determinations for RIIO-T2 and cautiously welcomed Ofgem's movement on a number of fronts in its Final Determination in December 2020. There are, however, till some concerns.\n\nWhile the bulk of the price control settlement matched SSEN Transmission's ambition, the financial parameters did not. An appeal was lodged - echoed by the rest of the industry and now progressing with the CMA - that is technical in nature, centring on the cost of equity, which does not reflect market conditions, and the flawed outperformance wedge as well as exposure to under recovery of TNUoS and loss of appeals rights.\n\nFurther afield, widespread blackouts in Texas in early 2021 exposed vulnerabilities of outdated market systems and sparked a conversation regarding what can happen with low levels of regulation and resilience. A failure to prepare for severe weather events and adequately invest in critical infrastructure highlighted the importance of anticipatory investment, system planning and the value of necessary regulation.",

Changes in rainfall and wind patterns can determine the output levels of SSE Renewables' generation assets. Extreme weather events can also impact the resilience of SSEN's electricity networks and lead to variations in energy demand which affect SSE's customer businesses.\n\nThe interconnectivity of international commodity markets and national energy systems - particularly between GB, Ireland and continental Europe - adds an additional layer of complexity to the impact of weather events on wholesale energy prices and SSE's earnings.\n\nWhile it is vital that governments and businesses act to mitigate the impact of climate change, both must simultaneously implement climate adaptation strategies as climate-related events become increasingly frequent.\n\nEvents in Texas in February 2021 demonstrated the vulnerability of energy systems to extreme weather and the importance of investment in infrastructure to boost resilience in the face of a changing climate. In the same month, SSE's teams in\n\nthe North of Scotland region contended with some of the worst weather conditions in over a decade which brought significant localised challenges.\n\nSSE has established crisis management and business continuity plans in place to help mitigate the impact of severe weather events that pose a risk to critical national energy infrastructure.\n\nSSE's expert teams closely monitor meteorological events which enables rapid response and early mobilisation when required to support energy consumers and ultimately strategic business goals. This work includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Predicting how forecast temperatures might affect energy demand and whether daily temperature fluctuations will require a response from generation assets.\n- \u00b7 Weather forecasting to inform the purchasing decisions of SSE's energy portfolio managers, improving procurement operations.\n- \u00b7 Determining short-, medium- and long-term wind forecasts and electricity output from renewables assets.\n- \u00b7 Gauging how rainfall patterns will impact hydro-electric generation output and storage capacity.\n- \u00b7 Forecasting extreme and unseasonal weather such as high winds, snow and rainfall that could affect the resilience of distribution and transmission infrastructure.\n\n## Climate adaptation\n\nThe issue of climate adaptation has been at the heart of the UK Government's advocacy policies for COP26 and SSE welcomed the UK's Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC in December 2020. Additionally, in February 2021, the European Commission published the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change as part of the EU Green Deal.\n\nFor SSE, boosting resilience and assessing climate adaptation requirements is an essential aspect of its sustainability work. SSE is particularly supportive of the Commission's proposals to use better data to inform necessary climate adaptation preparations and the recognition of climate adaptation as a priority for a green-led recovery from coronavirus.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The relationship with key stakeholders is two-way, with SSE relying on a range of inputs, in return for which value is generated. An overview of the reciprocal nature of SSE's relationship with its stakeholders is illustrated by the business model framework on pages 10 to 11 \uf150 and set out in detail on the following pages.\n\n## Energy customers\n\nWe engage to support an accessible low-carbon energy system that represents value for customers' money.\n\n## Input to SSE:\n\nCustomer priorities and expectations.\n\n## Value created:\n\nReliable and inclusive provision of services.\n\n## Suppliers, contractors and partners\n\nWe engage to support the greatest all-round value from our investments.\n\n## Input to SSE:\n\nQuality goods and services and investment.\n\n## Value created:\n\nSustainable relationships, value creation and partnership expertise.",

        "page_content": "## Engagement methods, impact and influence\n\nSSE adopts a range of engagement methods to build constructive relationships and a dynamic, two-way dialogue that tracks priorities and understanding on specific stakeholder issues. These methods exist in a strategic framework that sees a combination of business-led and Board-level engagement and is reflective of legislative and regulatory requirements, characterised for example, by the dedicated stakeholder forums in SSE's networks businesses. Details of just some of the engagement methods deployed, and views captured during 2020/21 are covered on pages 30 to 31 \uf150 .\n\nA single metric cannot define the success or otherwise of a stakeholder relationship. However, by considering the size of the stakeholder group, extent of engagement and value returned - financial or nonfinancial - certain measurements can aid understanding of where further opportunities or risks exist. Examples of these measurements are provided on pages 11, 22 to 23 \uf150 and overleaf.\n\nThe full impact of SSE's approach results in stakeholder influence within, and validity of, business plans and supporting objectives. The framework set by the Board in which decision making takes place is explained on page 104 \uf150 , which confirms that consideration of SSE's purpose, vision, strategy and values, and its interconnectivity with stakeholders should drive appropriate outcomes. Situations will continue to exist where not every stakeholder interest can be addressed in full, however stakeholder regard continues to the fullest extent possible.\n\nWith stakeholder considerations longembedded in SSE's definition of a healthy business culture, evidencing the influence of stakeholder perspectives remains a focus across the Annual Report and SSE's Sustainability Report.\n\n## STRATEGY IN ACTION\n\nMulti-dimensional stakeholder engagement influences the direction of SSE's strategy and the choices it makes to create value for shareholders and society ( see pages 16 to 21 \uf150 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BOARD PRINCIPAL DECISION\n\nResponsible leadership and considered decision-making require the integration of stakeholder views and an understanding of stakeholder outcomes ( see pages 107 to 109, 124 and 127 \uf150 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION\n\nSSE works directly with its key stakeholders to understand and respond to material issues ( see pages 39, 45, 48, 51, 52, 53, 105 and 116 \uf150 ).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has meant that, in the face of a particularly challenging year, SSE continued to create and share considerable value with shareholders and society - from making a \u00a35.6bn contribution to the UK and Irish economies, to creating hundreds of new jobs since the start of April 2020, to cutting carbon emissions to its lowest level since measurements began in 2001.\n\nAs society emerges from the worst of the pandemic, there is a unique opportunity for a green and resilient economic recovery through investment in net zero, which is being pursued by both the UK and Irish governments.\n\nIn addition, SSE defines a further four SDGs as material to its business: SDG10 Reduced inequalities; SDG12 Responsible consumption and production; SDG14 Life below water; and SDG15 Life on land.\n\nSSE's Sustainability Report 2021 , the sister document to the Annual Report 2021, is structured entirely around SSE's contribution to these highly material, and material, SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aligning societal and business objectives through the SDGs\n\nThe UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework is the global blueprint for a sustainable future. SSE believes that all organisations - whether they are governments, businesses or civil society have a role to play in achieving them.\n\nSince 2019, SSE has aligned its business strategy to the SDGs most material to its business. SSE believes that this approach is good for its business and for society. It enables SSE to find profitable solutions to some of society's greatest challenges.\n\nThe SDGs SSE defines as 'highly material' to its business and to which it aligns its strategy and operations are: SDG13 Climate action; SDG7 Affordable and clean energy; SDG9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure; and SDG8 Decent work and economic growth. SSE's 2030 Goals for the company, which are linked to executive remuneration, are aligned to these highly material SDGs ( see pages 14 to 15 \uf150 ).\n\n<!-- image -->",

They also allow SSE assess its relative performance on sustainability issues.\n\nSSE is also a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), incorporating the Ten Principles of the UNGC into its approach to business, and aligning disclosures and KPIs in its Sustainability Report to international non-financial reporting standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and, from 2021, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\nSSE also actively engages with key investor ESG ratings agencies and investor-led initiatives, including S&P's Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), the water and carbon programmes in the CDP global disclosure framework, Workforce Disclosure\n\nConstruction begins at Keadby 2, Europe's most efficient gas plant\n\nSSE sets four 2030 Goals, aligned to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals\n\n2019\n\nSSE meets its 2020 carbon intensity reduction target early\n\nInitiative (WDI), Morgan Stanley Capital International, Vigeo Eiris, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the FTSE4Good Index.

SSE is continuing to monitor the dialogue around standardising nonfinancial reporting disclosures and will respond constructively when consensus emerges. In the meantime, it will seek to provide disclosures consistent with all the main standard-setting bodies.\n\n## More information\n\nGroup policies, guides, assurance\n\ndocuments and other reports can be found on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\nSSE's Non-Financial Information Statement is on page 93 \uf150 .\n\nSSE secures the most low-carbon contracts in the UK's third Contracts for Difference Allocation Round\n\n2021\n\nSSE meets TCFD reporting recommendations in full, ahead of the 2022 deadline\n\nSSE closes its last remaining coal power station\n\nTargets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative for the SSE Group and for SSEN Transmission ( page 39 \uf150 )\n\nSSE becomes first company, to its knowledge, to publish a Just Transition strategy ( page 45 \uf150 )\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'A long-term commitment to sustainability recognises the constant need to pre-empt and adapt to social and environmental impacts of business activity.

SSE's strategy is focused on supporting this transition in a way that creates and shares value with shareholders and society. SSE is committed to open and transparent disclosure to allow its stakeholders to assess properly its environmental performance.\n\n## Driving climate action\n\nSSE recognises the serious threat that climate change poses to the natural world and, therefore, to people and the economy. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the climate emergency has continued to dominate the public and political agenda over 2020/21.\n\n## Mandating climate-related financial disclosures in the UK\n\nIn November 2020, the UK Government announced that it would be mandating climate-related financial disclosures, and that from 2022 all publicly listed UK companies with a premium listing will be required to report in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\n\nThe TCFD recommendations set an important framework for understanding and analysing climate-related risks and\n\nopportunities, and SSE is committed to regular and transparent reporting to these requirements. The information in this Annual Report, along with disclosures in its Sustainability Report 2021, represents SSE's third TCFD disclosure. A summary table that highlights how SSE meets the TCFD recommendations and signposts to where additional information can be found is provided on pages 40 and 41 \uf150 .\n\nIn light of the upcoming mandated TCFD reporting, in February 2021, it was agreed that the Group Risk Committee will now govern SSE's TCFD processes and disclosures.\n\nAdditional information can be found in SSE's CDP Climate Change Programme submission, for which SSE received an 'A-' for its 2020 disclosure. All of these disclosures are available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## SSE's 2050 climate ambition\n\nWith the UK's net zero legislation in place since 2019 and Ireland's Climate Action Bill announced in March 2021, SSE believes its most significant contribution is to align with the Paris Agreement goal and aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest.\n\nIn October 2020, the SSE plc Board committed to the long-term ambition of achieving net zero carbon emissions across all its operations by 2050 at the latest, covering both SSE's direct and indirect emissions, or its scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time SSE joined the 'Race to Zero', a global campaign which aims to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions and investors to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions in SSE's value chain*\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Underpinning its 2050 ambition to be net zero, SSE has a series of 2030 sciencebased targets, aligned with the Paris Agreement. These targets set out SSE's medium-term emissions pathway, more detail is provided on page 39 \uf150 .\n\nThere are three elements to SSE's net zero plan: to reduce carbon in SSE's operations; to deliver low-carbon infrastructure in the energy sector (renewables, thermal and networks); and to support the value chain in the transition to net zero through electrification, suppliers and customers.\n\n## Advocating for climate action\n\nSSE believes that bold and decisive policymaking can unlock the kind of investment needed to deliver net zero ambitions, tackle climate change and help spur a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Its constructive approach to public advocacy in 2020/21 was typified by the publication of SSE's 'Greenprint' in May 2020. The objective of this document was to support the UK Government with practical proposals that could help stimulate economic activity and support jobs and investment. It was followed by a similar document in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nExtensive engagement followed the publication of these proposals, focusing on five core areas of policy development: a net zero power system; strategic investment in electricity networks; a clean industrial revolution; leading the charge on electric vehicles; and, green buildings for green jobs. Subsequently, SSE warmly welcomed the Prime Minister's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution published in November 2020.\n\nSSE is a Principal Partner of the UK's presidency of COP26 and will seek to use its decade-long experience of the transition to net zero as a practical example in support of further, accelerated international action.\n\n## Proposed climate resolution\n\nSSE believes that both the company and its investors will benefit from enhanced engagement on climate-related issues. Having worked closely with investor group Climate Action 100+ over 2020/21, SSE is therefore proposing an enabling resolution to its 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM) that will establish a framework for annual votes on its Net Zero Transition report at future AGMs. More information around the key considerations taken by the Board in agreeing the proposed climate resolution can be found on page 111 \uf150 .\n\n## Financing the net zero transition\n\nSSE understands that investors are increasingly looking for robust mechanisms through which they can ensure their investments are sustainable and take account of climate-related risks. As a result, SSE has deliberately pursued a strategy of issuing green bonds to finance its investment plans. In March 2021, it issued its fourth green bond in five years, reaffirming its position as the largest issuer of green bonds from the UK corporate sector. It remains the only UK corporate to offer up multiple green bonds and the latest issuance brings the total outstanding to \u00a32bn.\n\nFurthermore, in March SSE published a new framework through which it can issue its first sustainability-linked bond. Unlike a green bond, where proceeds are ringfenced for qualifying low-carbon investments, a sustainability-linked bond would set a coupon based on a commitment from the company to achieve strategic, sustainability-related KPIs.\n\n## SSE's key climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nSSE has assessed the climate impact on its operations from the physical risks of increased extreme weather events or changes in average weather trends to the potential transition risks from policy, technology or market change. SSE has identified the climate-related risks and opportunities that are most material to the business as a result of the potential impact they may have. SSE provides extensive detail in its Sustainability Report 2021, alongside detailed discussion around impacts and mitigation measures.\n\nThe key climate risks identified were the physical impacts of extreme or changing weather conditions on renewable and network operations; alongside transition risks related to renewable wholesale prices and the resilience of network assets to changing policy. The opportunities relate to the role that renewables, transmission, thermal and networks play in supporting the transition to net zero by 2050 at the latest.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the limited assurance opinion see sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## SSE's carbon emissions performance\n\nIn 2020/21, SSE's total carbon emissions consisted of 64% scope 1 emissions, 5% scope 2 emissions and 31% scope 3 emissions. SSE's total carbon emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) decreased by around 12% between 2019/20 and 2020/21. While carbon emissions reduced across all three scopes, the most material contributing factor to this decrease was a result of the change in the generation mix of SSE's thermal generation plant. Carbon emitted from the generation of electricity contributes 99% of SSE's scope 1 emissions.\n\n- 1.  The thermal generation mix changed in 2020/21 following the closure of SSE's final coal-fired power station, Fiddler's Ferry, in March 2020. This led to a corresponding reduction in the carbon emissions from SSE's thermal generation plant which meant that SSE's electricity generation emissions fell by 14% (from 8.21MtCO 2 e to 7.06MtCO 2 e); and\n- 2.  With no coal generation output less electricity was required to operate the thermal generation plant and as a result scope 2 emissions relating to electricity use in power stations reduced by around 45%.\n\nIn addition to the change in thermal generation mix, the carbon factors SSE used to calculate its emissions fell as a direct result of the decarbonisation of the GB electricity grid which impacted emissions associated with electricity\n\nconsumption in buildings and operations and the associated electricity network losses in both the transmission and distribution networks.\n\nThis means that SSE made good progress towards one of its key science-based targets to cut by 40% carbon emission associated with its scope 1 and 2 activity between 2017/18 and 2030. Between 2017/18 and 2020/21 those emissions have fallen by over 3MtCO 2 e (from 11.07MtCO 2 e to 7.64MtCO 2 e ), representing a 31% fall.\n\n## SSE's carbon intensity performance\n\nThe carbon intensity of SSE's generated electricity decreased to 255gCO 2 e/kWh in comparison to 288gCO 2 e/kWh the previous year.\n\nWhile SSE's carbon emissions from thermal generation fell between 2019/20 and 2020/21, thermal generation output was higher in 2020/21 than in the previous year, reflecting the important role thermal generation plays in providing flexible and dispatchable generation when renewable output is low on the electricity system.\n\nIn the same period, output from SSE's renewable generation portfolio fell to 9.7TWh in 2020/21, from 10.8TWh the previous year (inc. pumped storage and biomass). This was due to reduced wind and hydro output because of lower wind and rain.\n\n## GENERATION OUTPUT AND ELECTRICITY GENERATION CARBON EMISSIONS\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Overall, this means that SSE is making good progress towards its second key science-based target which is to cut the carbon intensity of electricity generation by 60% by 2030 from a 2017/18 baseline. Since 2017/18, SSE has reduced its carbon intensity by 16% from over 300gCO 2 e/kWh to 255gCO 2 e/kWh.\n\n## Science-based carbon targets\n\nIn April 2020, SSE set medium-term carbon targets, approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), aligned to the Paris Agreement and a 'well below two-degree' pathway. These targets are aligned to climate science and meet the strict SBTi criteria which requires that they cover scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Detail of these four carbon targets and where to find information on performance is outlined in the pull-out box.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the SBTi, SSE Group will review its targets in advance of the five-year review period or if there is\n\nCARBON INTENSITY OF SSE'S GENERATED ELECTRICITY\n\n255gCO 2 e/ kWh\n\nmaterial change to SSE's business activities that impacts its carbon emissions, or which ever happens first. This review of targets will be completed in accordance with the latest scientific evidence and criteria.\n\nIn August 2020, SSEN Transmission had its own series of carbon targets approved by the SBTi, making it the first electricity networks company globally to receive external accreditation for a sciencebased target in line with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. These carbon targets can be found in SSEN Transmission's Sustainability Report 2019/20.\n\nSSEN Distribution became the first UK Distribution Network Operator to commit publicly to setting science-based targets, in January 2021. It will announce its sciencebased targets as part of its upcoming draft business plan for RIIO-ED2 in July 2021.\n\nCARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION ACHIEVED FROM 2017/18 BASE YEAR\n\n16.4%\n\n(2017/18 base year: 305gCO 2 e/kWh)\n\n(2019/20: 288gCO 2 e/kWh)\n\n## WORKING WITH SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS TO CUT CARBON\n\nTo deliver carbon reductions from its scope 3 activity in its supply chain, SSE must work closely with its supply chain partners. One of SSE's SBTi-approved targets is to engage with 50% of suppliers (according to financial expenditure) to set their own science-based targets by 2024. Over 2020/21, SSE held 29 workshops with key suppliers to facilitate dialogue and knowledge-sharing around the setting of science-based carbon targets and the challenges and opportunities presented for various industries. SSE has been encouraged by the appetite for supplier engagement on climate-related issues and welcomes the proactive\n\nengagement from its supply chain. At 31 March 2021, 29% of SSE's suppliers (by value) had set their own sciencebased targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n29\n\nWorkshops held with key suppliers sharing knowledge on science-based carbon targets\n\n## SSE Group SBTi-approved carbon targets:\n\nReduce the carbon intensity of electricity generated by 60% by 2030, from 2017/28 baseline\n\nSee 'SSE's carbon intensity performance' section, on page 38 \uf150 .\n\nReduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 from a 2017/18 base year\n\nSee 'SSE's carbon emissions performance' section, on page 38 \uf150 .\n\nReduce absolute GHG emissions from use of products sold by 50% by 2034 from a 2017/18 base year\n\nSee SSE's Sustainability Report 2021 for progress \uf223 .\n\nEngage with 50% of suppliers by spend to set an SBT by 2024\n\nSee SSE's Sustainability Report 2021 for progress \uf223 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS AND PARTNERS\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH CONTINUED\n\n## Responsible resource use\n\nIt is understood that the consequence of human activity on the natural environment through consumption and the resulting habitat loss and species decline is as great a risk to people as climate change. In its transition to net zero, SSE seeks actively to manage its environmental footprint in a way that minimises adverse environmental impacts and, where possible, it seeks to add environmental value too.\n\n## Managing water use\n\nSSE depends on water in various ways across its operations, from use in electricity generation to an amenity in its buildings, and it seeks to use water in a sustainable way. None of SSE's thermal and hydroelectric generation assets impact on water stressed areas, as defined by the relevant environmental regulators.\n\nIn 2020/21, total water abstracted by SSE fell to 26,030 million m 3 from 27,757 million m 3 the previous year. This was largely due to a reduction in water passing through SSE's hydro-electric generation plant as a result of lower levels of rainfall compared to the previous year.\n\nThe vast majority (97%) of water abstracted in 2020/21 was used in SSE's hydro-electric generation operations. This water passes through turbines to generate electricity and is returned to the environment almost immediately. Total water abstracted is often used by SSE's stakeholders to judge its environmental impact and allow a comparison across businesses and sectors. SSE believes that this indicator taken in isolation can reflect negatively on hydroelectricity generators. To help stakeholders better understand a more proportionate environmental impact, SSE's abstraction volume excluding hydro-electric generation has also been provided in the table below.\n\nTotal water consumed also fell over this period, by almost 29%. This was due to a change in the generation mix and the different types of cooling water used by SSE's thermal generation activities.\n\n## SSE's energy consumption\n\nSSE acts to reduce energy use and thereby cut carbon from its assets through a combination of physical improvements and building user engagement. Between 2019/20 and 2020/21, the energy SSE purchased for use in its assets (offices, depots, power stations and data centres) fell by almost 30%, from 334GWh to 234GWh. This was largely as a result of a reduction in electricity used to operate SSE's thermal generation plant, as a result of the closure of SSE's last coal-fired power plant.\n\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic resulting in the majority of SSE's employees working from home, energy consumption in its facility managed offices didn't decrease as significantly as might be expected due to the need to continue to maintain buildings to meet heating and ventilation industry and government guidelines for the safe operation of buildings during the pandemic.\n\nDuring 2020/21, SSE also invested in a range of energy efficiency measures and in particular delivered a programme of LED lighting upgrades to depot sites. Over this period, SSE purchased 100% of its electricity for use in its facility managed offices from renewable sources, backed by renewable guarantees. In 2020/21, 39% of the electricity that SSE purchased for its assets was from renewable sources, up from 29% the previous year.\n\nSSE's 'Better Off' behaviour change campaign, alongside its investment of \u00a312.8m since 2011/12 in energy efficiency and building renewable generation programmes, has helped to reduce carbon emissions from energy used in its buildings. This investment programme has assisted in the delivery of a 42% reduction in carbon emissions since 2017/18.\n\nSSE is a member of the Climate Group's EP100 initiative to encourage businesses to improve energy productivity and has pledged to cut carbon from its offices and depots by 20% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline. SSE is also a member of the EV100 pledge to move to an electric vehicle fleet by 2030.\n\n## Managing air emissions\n\nIn 2020/21, SSE's thermal generation sites emitted 4,103 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (NOx), compared 6,080 tonnes the previous year - a reduction of 33%. In addition, emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) fell considerably by 44%, to 1,372 tonnes from 2,464 tonnes the previous year. Both of these reductions were as a result of the closure of SSE's last remaining coal-fired generation plant in March 2020.\n\nIn 2019/20, SSE's sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) emissions fell slightly to 295kg from 318kg the previous year. In 2020/21, SSE's electricity networks businesses reviewed the methodology used to report SF 6 data, therefore 2019/20 data has been restated.\n\nSF 6 is widely used by the electricity industry around the world due to its insulating properties and therefore its ability to keep people safe from electrical 'arcing'. You can read more about what SSE is doing to increase the use of alternative technologies in its Sustainability Report 2021.\n\n## Data assurance and environmental metrics\n\nWhere data has been externally and independently assured, this has been noted in the relevant tables. In all other areas, data is identified and disclosed according to SSE's internal processes and guided by environmental regulations where appropriate.",

SSE has a responsibility to influence those impacts as it transitions out of high-carbon activities at the same time as seizing the opportunities to increase value and share economic prosperity from the transition into a net zero world. A Just Transition to net zero will mean that the actions and investments required to decarbonise energy systems attract long-term public support and legitimacy.\n\n## GDP and tax contribution\n\nThe way that SSE invests in the decarbonisation of the UK and Irish economies contributes to society by adding economic value, supporting jobs and contributing to the public purse through tax revenues.\n\n## Contributing to UK and Irish GDP\n\nBy investing across the UK and Ireland, SSE supports thousands of jobs and contributes billions of pounds to these economies each year. SSE's \u00a37.5bn capex plan across the five years to FY25 is on track, with construction well under way at flagship SSE Renewables projects including Seagreen, Viking and the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank. The Company is therefore playing an important role in supporting the green economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSSE has commissioned professional services firm PwC to calculate the size of its economic contribution in the UK and Ireland each year since 2011/12. Over this 10 year period, the PwC analysis shows that SSE has contributed \u00a3100bn (in current prices) to the UK and Irish economies.\n\nThe 2020/21 PwC analysis showed that SSE contributed \u00a35.2bn to the UK economy and \u20ac439m to the Irish economy, supporting a total of 43,560 jobs across these countries. This compares to a \u00a35.7bn (\u00a37.7bn including SSE Energy Services) contribution to the UK economy and a \u20ac650m contribution to the Irish economy in 2019/20.\n\nThe PwC reports on SSE's economic contribution for 2020/21 and all previous years of analysis can be found on sse.com/ sustainability/reporting \uf295 .\n\n## 2020/21 UK and Irish GDP and tax contribution*\n\nIRELAND CONTRIBUTION TO GDP\n\n\u20ac439m 2019/20: \u20ac650m\n\nIRELAND JOBS SUPPORTED\n\n2,160 2019/20: 3,740\n\nTAX PAID IN IRELAND\n\n\u20ac20.4m\n\n2019/20: \u20ac18.1m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 2019/20 contribution excludes contribution from SSE Energy Services.\n\n## Paying a fair share of tax\n\nThe reliance on public services to keep people safe and support workers during the coronavirus pandemic demonstrates the importance of the social contract between companies and society to pay their fair share of tax. In 2014 SSE became the first FTSE 100 company to be accredited with the Fair Tax Mark, an independent standard for tax fairness and transparency. It has remained committed to paying its fair share of tax in the right place, at the right time, and providing open and transparent disclosure on its tax approach through its annual 'Talking Tax' report. Its latest report, 'Talking Tax 2020: Proud to pay our part', was published in November 2020.\n\nUK CONTRIBUTION TO GDP\n\n\u00a35.2bn 2019/20: \u00a35.7bn\n\nUK JOBS SUPPORTED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTAX PAID IN THE UK\n\n\u00a3379m 2019/20: \u00a3421.6m",

        "page_content": "## A BUSINESS FIRST: SSE'S STRATEGY FOR A JUST TRANSITION\n\nRoyal London Asset Management and Friends Provident Foundation submitted a question in advance of the 2020 AGM asking SSE to consider adopting a formal Just Transition strategy. SSE committed to doing so in its response and continued to engage with the investors as the strategy developed. The investors proved both influential and helpful in shaping SSE's thinking around the Just Transition and how it could best be formalised and communicated. Furthermore, direct engagement with a wide group of stakeholders including trade unions at a company and national level continues to support the development of the strategy and its priority actions.\n\nIn November 2020, SSE published its Just Transition strategy which outlines SSE's principles for integrating social impacts of delivering net zero. This strategy has been described as the world's first business strategy for a Just Transition.\n\nOngoing and constructive dialogue continues with a broad range of stakeholders. Active engagement has\n\nSSE is one of the UK's biggest taxpayers, ranking 16th in the PwC 2020 Total Tax Contribution survey of the 100 Group, published in December 2020, in terms of taxes borne. Over 2020/21, SSE paid \u00a3379m of tax in the UK, compared with \u00a3421.6m in the previous year. Information on why there was a reduction in taxes paid can be found on page 76 \uf150 .\n\nIn 2020/21 SSE also paid \u20ac20.4m of taxes in Ireland, compared to \u20ac18.1m the previous year. Ireland is the only country outside the UK in which it has any trading operations.\n\n## Employees\n\nA primary social impact of any company is made through the people it employs. SSE has a long-standing commitment to fair and decent work for the people that work for the company, whether that's directly or on SSE's behalf.\n\nalready taken place at 10 different stakeholder conferences, including four with the investor community, since November. SSE also supported the launch of the Investor Coalition for a Just Transition, led by the Grantham Institute alongside investors and trade unions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taking care of physical and mental health\n\nFrom March 2020, SSE's immediate safety and health priority was the management of the coronavirus crisis and associated risks. This demonstrated why a robust health and safety culture is so important for businesses, with SSE able to build on existing approaches to ensure that it took care of employees and was able to implement quickly new measures and provide new guidance.\n\nSSE's message to all employees is 'If it's not safe, we don't do it', with key aim that everyone who works for the Company or on its behalf gets home safe each day. SSE's safety performance over 2020/21 is provided in the Safety, Health and Environment Advisory Committee Report on pages 140 to 143 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION SHAREHOLDERS AND DEBT PROVIDERS\n\nSSE HAS PRESENTED ITS JUST TRANSITION STRATEGY AT\n\n10\n\nstakeholder conferences since November 2020\n\nSSE has emphasised the importance of parity of focus between mental and physical health, with initiatives including Mental Health First Aiders, employee assistance counselling, additional counselling through a partnership with Nuffield Health, and access to a range of wellbeing programmes, as well as muscular-skeletal treatments and a range of subsidised and participatory physical exercise programmes.\n\nIn response to the potential increase in stress levels and isolation as a result of the majority of employees working from home on a full-time basis, new initiatives were also introduced over 2020/21 for employees. This included online workout sessions, online learning on topics from mental health to resilience and coping with change, mindfulness conference calls and weekly virtual wellbeing cafes.",

        "page_content": "## A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH CONTINUED\n\nSSE also granted 10 days of emergency leave to help employees having to cope with caring responsibilities during the pandemic.\n\nEmployee absence levels over 2020/21 have been at a historic low, with an average of 5.9 days lost per head over the year, a 35% improvement from the year before. For 2021/22, SSE has set a target of 6.7 days lost per head, reflecting improvements and the impact of coronavirus in terms of suppressing other types of sickness absence, with flexibility and working from home seen as a key driver of the reduction in absence levels.\n\n## A growing and changing workforce\n\nProviding energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow has enabled SSE to grow its workforce through its core businesses during this challenging period and not draw on government coronavirus worker support schemes. The company has not made any coronavirus-related redundancies and has worked with trade union partners to ensure all employees are kept on normal pay.\n\nSSE's headcount grew from 12,133 at the end of 2019/20 to 12,489 at the end of 2020/21. 1,529 people joined SSE over the year (2019/20: 1,428) and retention of SSE's workforce also increased significantly during 2020/21 compared to 2019/20, from 88% to 92.1%, which has largely been attributed to the pandemic and consequential labour market instability. 95% of SSE employees are on permanent contracts, consistent with previous years.\n\nMajor SSE Renewables infrastructure projects in development and construction are driving a significant increase in recruitment, with core staffing in this business expected to grow by at least another 10% over 2020/21. Implementation of SSEN Transmission's RIIO-T2 business plan, 'A Network for Net Zero', is also expected to significantly increase headcount within this business.\n\nSSE's focus on its core networks and renewables businesses, supported by businesses complementary to that core, means that it is continuing with planned disposals of other non-core business areas. In 2019/20, this included the sale of SSE Energy Services which resulted in around 8,000 SSE employees moving to OVO Energy Services Ltd. On 1 April 2021,\n\nSSE announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Contracting business to the Aurelius investment group. This will mean around 1,900 employees will transfer to the new contracting business outside of SSE, where SSE believes the business will be better able to fulfil its potential for customers and employees.\n\n## Developing skills\n\nThe energy sector faces the challenge of maintaining traditional skills and capabilities, whilst also developing those needed for the transformation to net zero. To achieve this, SSE has developed training plans aligned to its strategic objectives; delivering inclusive, accessible, modern learning that builds capability, develops talent and skills, and supports long-term, rewarding careers.\n\nOver 2020/21, SSE invested \u00a315.8m in internal and external learning and development activities (2019/20: \u00a318.6m). The majority of this investment, \u00a39m, was to support 470 people in early career programmes, including apprenticeships, Technical Skills Trainees, graduates and employability programmes. Early career positions are valued by SSE and the wider industry, demonstrated by the continued support during a time of significant labour market uncertainty.\n\nSafety measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic paused non-critical training, condensed in-person courses, and increased virtual and digital delivery sessions. This resulted in a reduction in the average number of formal training hours per full-time SSE employee from 24.9 hours in 2019/20 to 9.0 hours in 2020/21. Additional support was provided by promoting an 'everyday learning' culture and an increase of self-led digital learning assets, with over 140 new items added to SSE's 'My Learning' portal. Formal training was reinforced with coaching conversations and mentoring. The self-led learning and informal arrangements are not captured in the average number of training hours per employee.\n\nSSE's HR and Strategy teams continue to work closely to identify company-wide core capabilities, as well as with each of SSE's businesses to determine specific skills, training, learning and recruitment needs. More information on SSE's learning and training programmes can be found in the Sustainability Report 2021.\n\n| DIRECT EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12,489                                                             |\n| 2019/20: 12,133                                                    |\n| EMPLOYEE GENDER SPLIT /parenleft.caseMALE/FEMALE/parenright.case   |\n| 9,190/3,299                                                        |\n| 2019/20: 9,088/3,045                                               |\n| EMPLOYEE GENDER SPLIT /parenleft.case% MALE/FEMALE/parenright.case |\n| 73.6/26.4                                                          |\n| 2019/20: 74.9/25.1                                                 |\n| CONTINGENT WORKER HEADCOUNT 1,950                                  |\n| 2019/20: 2,335                                                     |\n| EXTERNAL RECRUITMENT /parenleft.caseHEADCOUNT/parenright.case      |\n| 1,529                                                              |\n| 2019/20: 1,428                                                     |\n| TOTAL RETENTION/TURNOVER RATE /parenleft.case%/parenright.case     |\n| 92.1/7.9                                                           |\n| 2019/20: 88.0/12.0                                                 |\n| VOLUNTARY TURNOVER RATE /parenleft.case%/parenright.case           |\n| 3.6                                                                |\n| 2019/20: 6.5                                                       |\n| 10.7/7.7  2019/20: 11.1/8.4                                        |\n| EMPLOYEES ON PERMANENT CONTRACTS /parenleft.case%/parenright.case  |\n| 95.0                                                               |\n| 2019/20: 95.4                                                      |\n\n## EMPLOYEE STATISTICS FOR 2020/21*",

        "page_content": "## Reinforcing a healthy ethical culture\n\nAn organisation's culture is a key determinant of its long-term success. SSE's revised 'Doing the Right Thing: guide to good business ethics', published in early 2020/21 and available on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 , is SSE's code of conduct which supports the adoption of the right values, attitudes and behaviours to contribute to an ethical business culture at SSE. The guide applies to all SSE employees as well those that work on its behalf. It covers topics including fair competition, business separation, engagement with politicians and regulators, modern slavery, safeguarding the environment, managing data and cyber security. SSE also has mandatory ethics and compliance training modules which all employees are required to complete.\n\nFor the first time in 2019/20, SSE undertook a culture health-check to understand how employee sentiment, provided from the employee engagement survey, aligned with a range of additional metrics, such as employee turnover rates, sickness rates, safety metrics and wellbeing figures. This is reported to the Board biannually as a cultural dashboard. See pages 112 and 113 \uf150 for information on the Board's focus on SSE's workplace culture.\n\n## Speaking up against wrongdoing\n\nEmpowering people to speak up against wrongdoing is a central element of SSE's approach to good business ethics and doing the right thing. This can be done through an independent whistleblowing channel, called SafeCall, as well as through SSE's internal channels. The effectiveness of SSE's whistleblowing arrangements are reviewed twice yearly by the GEC and the Board.\n\nOver calendar year 2020, there were 66 reports of wrongdoing made through SSE's speak up channels, a decrease from 88 in 2019 which is understood to be driven by changes in working caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A breakdown of these reports, including how they were made, what they related to and the outcomes of investigation can be found in the Sustainability Report 2021.\n\n## Preventing bribery and corruption\n\nCorruption and criminality, including bribery, fraud and other financial crime, are unacceptable in all circumstances. SSE takes proactive steps to mitigate this risk occurring in its direct or supply chain operations.\n\nThis includes a robust approach to governance, mandatory training and an established policy framework. SSE's 'Doing the Right Thing' guide to ethical behaviour and its Group Corruption and Financial Crime Prevention Policy are available on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\nSSE's Anti-Corruption and Financial Crime Committee (ACFCC) reports into the Group Risk Committee and is chaired by SSE's Finance Director. It oversees work across the Company to strengthen controls and ensure a robust and proactive approach to the corruption and financial crime compliance program. The ACFCC is supported by the Anti-Financial Crime Steering Group and Crime Prevention and Investigation Steering Group.\n\nAt the end of 2020/21, 95% of SSE employees were certified in the company's 'Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Sanctions' eLearning module, 90% were certified in the 'Bribery and AntiCorruption' eLearning module and 93% were certified in the 'Fraud Awareness' eLearning module.\n\nOf the total 66 reports of potential wrongdoing made over calendar year 2020, 26% (17 reports) related to 'Dishonest behaviour' (2019: 25%) which includes reports relating to fraud, theft, integrity, corruption and bribery. All of these reports were investigated fully by appropriate areas of the business, with outputs reviewed by SSE's Group Security and Investigation Team prior to closure on the Whistleblowing Register. Of the 17 reports: two resulted in dismissals, one was subsequently investigated as a grievance; eight were investigated but with the case not proven; three resulted in an initial investigation establishing that there was insufficient evidence to proceed further; and three cases could not be investigated due to insufficient information to establish the nature, cause, location or otherwise of the allegation being provided.\n\n## Mitigating the risk of modern slavery\n\nModern slavery in any form is unacceptable in any circumstances. SSE undertakes steps to mitigate the risk of modern slavery in its direct and supply chain operations and in 2020/21 commissioned human rights experts Stronger Together to undertake a gap analysis of SSE's approach to preventing human rights violations and modern slavery against best practice.\n\nUsing the result of this process with Stronger Together, SSE has developed a new Modern Slavery Action Plan for 202123, focused on five key areas of focus: Tier 1 and beyond; Due diligence; Awareness and education; Response and doing the right thing; and Messaging and comms. This Action Plan is underpinned by robust governance, with the SSE Human Rights Steering Group now reporting directly to the Risk Committee, as well as to the GEC and to the Board annually.\n\nDetail on the gap analysis carried out by Stronger Together, SSE's Modern Slavery Action Plan and an update of SSE's activity over 2020/21 to mitigate the risk of human rights abuses within its direct and supply chain operations will be found within its Modern Slavery Statement 2021 which will be located on the sse.com \uf295 homepage.\n\n## Guaranteeing standards: a real Living Wage and Living Hours\n\nSSE has been a Living Wage accredited employer in the UK since 2013 and paid the Living Wage in Ireland since 2016, with 'Champion the real Living Wage' as one of the Company's 2030 Goals ( see page 15 \uf150 ). In late 2020/21, SSE gained accreditation as a Living Hours employer.\n\n## Leading workforce reporting\n\nSSE supports and encourages an investor-led approach to the standardisation of workforce disclosure to enable meaningful information to be reported and used to compare the approaches of different organisations. SSE has therefore been one of the leading companies providing detailed and open disclosure to the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI).\n\nSSE was shortlisted for the 'WDI award' and 'Contingent workforce data' award at the 2020 WDI Awards, with a special mention in the 'COVID-19 transparency', 'Workforce action' and 'Most transparent' categories.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH CONTINUED\n\nLiving Hours is a new accreditation from the Living Wage Foundation in the UK which recognises that people cannot earn a real Living Wage unless fair wages are also accompanied by secure and sufficient hours of work. SSE will work over 2021/22 to begin rolling this initiative out across its UK supply chain, as it has done with the Living Wage since 2014.\n\n## Listening to the employee voice\n\nThe core strand of SSE's employee voice strategy is the all-employee engagement survey. Typically these run annually, but were run more regularly during the coronavirus crisis period to capture employee sentiment on a number of key themes, including communication, strategy, leadership and wellbeing. This feedback has influenced employeefocused decisions on ways of working, communication and wellbeing. SSE's September 2020 employee engagement survey had a participation rate of 82% and an engagement score of 82%. This was 3% above the utilities sector benchmark and 8% above the UK benchmark.\n\nOver the past year, SSE has enhanced its employee voice strategy with the addition of exit surveys. The exit survey aligns to SSE's overall approach to gathering employee engagement insights through its employee engagement survey, and therefore allows a comparison of top/ bottom scoring answers for ex-employee sentiment on the company. The results are enabling SSE to gather meaningful and robust insights into why people leave the company, informing actions which aim to improve the employee experience.\n\nIn the context of the coronavirus pandemic, employee voice has been a particularly important consideration for the Board. Dame Sue Bruce DBE, SSE's non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, undertook enhanced direct engagement with colleagues, using virtual technologies and covering multiple Business Units and geographies. See pages 114 to 116 \uf150 .\n\n## LISTENING AND RESPONDING DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE's listening tools have been key in shaping the approach to employee support and Group-wide communications. A pulse survey conducted in May 2020 was the start point in identifying employees' concerns and priorities as the pandemic took hold. The research followed an overnight switch to a predominately working from home model, with those deemed critical workers continuing in their critical operational roles with enhanced health and safety measures in place.\n\nThe survey was completed by around 8,000 employees and set out clear requests for IT capability, increased health and wellbeing support, a desire to remain connected to SSE and anxiety over the future. In addition, clear guidelines on working arrangements were called for given the additional responsibilities that were being experienced by employees through home schooling and family care.\n\nTargeted actions were agreed and implemented, including: the ability to order\n\nthe necessary IT; the roll-out of Office 365 training including on its collaborative functionality; flexible working patterns and caring days; and the publication of a comprehensive health and wellbeing guide for employees to promote good physical and mental health, covering everything from healthy eating and exercise, to remote management and communications advice. In an effort to increase employee reach, the communication style has been a combination of written intranet articles, targeted emails, employee (including allcompany) calls and virtual contacts. The impact of SSE's response has in turn been assessed through additional employee focus groups including the programme of engagement conducted by the nonExecutive Director for Employee Engagement and a Great Place to Work pulse survey.\n\nIn May 2021, 400 days after the first day of the UK national lockdown, SSE also announced that it was providing employees with a \u00a3400/\u20ac450 thank you for their contribution through the pandemic.\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION EMPLOYEES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement with union partners\n\nEveryone that works for SSE has the fundamental right to freedom of association, including the right to join a trade union. In 2020/21, 53.9% of SSE's total direct workforce were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThe Joint Agreement, covering 46.9% of SSE employees, is the main collective bargained agreement for SSE employees. It is negotiated through the Joint Negotiating and Consultative Committee (the JNCC) which comprises SSE and its four recognised trade union partners: Unite, Unison, Prospect and the GMB. The full JNCC met eight times over 2020/21 to discuss terms, conditions and arrangements on employees' behalf.\n\nThere has been greater communication than ever between SSE and its union partners due to the coronavirus pandemic with weekly update calls held between senior managers and full-time officials and Joint Business Committees meeting on a monthly basis.",

        "page_content": "## Providing employee benefits\n\nSSE provides employees with a wide range of benefits, detailed on careers. sse.com/employee-benefits \uf295 . This includes flexible working arrangements, market-leading maternity benefits, allemployee shareplans, a holiday purchase scheme, cycle-to-work schemes and technology loans. In 2020/21, 98% of employees returned to work after maternity leave (84% in 2017, before SSE's current maternity benefits were introduced). A total of 73%/66% of UK/Ireland employees participated in the company's Share Incentive Plan and 46%/21% of UK/Ireland employees participated in the Sharesave programme (77%/38% and 24%/16% respectively in 2019/20).\n\n## Working towards inclusion and diversity\n\nSSE wants its business to be welcoming to all employees and to have a workplace culture that is inclusive to everyone. The company has therefore been implementing its 2017-2021 Inclusion Strategy, jointly developed with experts EAInclusion (previously called Equal Approach), which it refers to as its 'IN, ON and UP' approach. This strategy focuses on bringing all kinds of different people 'IN' to SSE, encouraging them to stay 'ON', and supporting them to progress 'UP' by ensuring processes, practices and policies are wholly inclusive.\n\nSignificant progress has been made in the key areas targeted by the strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 IN: Gender bias language reviews of all job adverts; inclusive hiring training for all hiring managers; open advertising of roles (78% of all roles in 2020/21); and flexible working offered in job adverts (89% of all roles in 2020/21);\n- \u00b7 ON: Roll-out of agile working practices; Inclusion and Diversity Working Groups in most businesses; six employee-led communities formed under the banner 'Belonging in SSE'; inclusion training for employees (95% of employees were certified at the end of 2020/21); and market-leading maternity benefits.\n- \u00b7 UP: Inclusion and diversity training for all; the creation of an Inclusive Leadership Development Programme (93 participants over 2020/21); greater focus on inclusion and diversity by the Board ( see page 127 \uf150 ).\n\n## Gender balance at senior levels\n\n2020/21\n\n| Gender split of:                                                                                    | Unit                           | target       | 2020/21        | 2019/20       | 2018/19       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Group Executive  Committee 1                                                                        | in group 3 (% female  shown in | -            | 6/2 (25%)      | 7/2   (22%)   | 7/2   (22%)   |\n| Group Executive  Committee 1  and  direct reports (excl.  admin employees) Group Executive          | in group 3 (% female  shown in | 30%   female |                | 48/12         |               |\n| Committee 1 , its  sub-committees   and Business   Unit Executive  Committees 2 Roles at \u00a370,000 or | in group 3 (% female  shown in | 25%   female | 39/13   (25%)  | (20%)         | 44/10   (19%) |\n| 1 April 2017)                                                                                       | brackets)                      |              | 67/26   (28%)  | 62/23   (27%) | 53/17   (24%) |\n|                                                                                                     | in group 3 (% female  shown in | 20%          | 518/100  (16%) | 524/108       | 477/91        |\n| above (indexed to                                                                                   | in group 3 (% female  shown in | female       |                | (17%)         | (16%)         |\n\n- 3 Data is correct as at 31 March in each financial year, with the exception of the 'Group Executive Committee, its sub-committees and Business Unit Executive Committees' in 2018/19 which is correct as at 1 April 2019. SSE's revised operating model was implemented on 1 April 2019 and was embedded throughout that financial year.\n\nIn SSE's 2020 employee engagement pulse survey, 84% of employees said they believe that their managers support diversity and inclusion, and recognise and respect the value of human difference. This is 7% above the utilities sector benchmark and 4% above the UK benchmark.\n\nFurther information on SSE's inclusion and diversity initiatives is detailed within SSE's Sustainability Report 2021.\n\n## Striving for gender balance\n\nSSE is concerned at the lack of diversity in the energy sector and specifically within the Company. For seven years it has focused on promoting greater gender balance at every level as part of its wider inclusion and diversity strategy. While there are signs of improvement, SSE operates in an environment where 69% of its job applicants are male, and delivering gender equality is proving to be a long-term challenge. This is therefore an area of increased focus for the Board and GEC.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, four of SSE's 11 Board members are women, meaning that SSE is one of 68 FTSE 100 companies that has met or exceeded the Hampton-Alexander Review target of 33% women on Boards. SSE was ranked 52nd out of FTSE 100 by Hampton Alexander in 2020, a move up from 65th in 2019. SSE is however still\n\nbelow its own internal target to have a three-year rolling average of 33% women on its Board, showing that this target will take time to reach despite good progress. More information about the diversity of the SSE Board and SSE's Board-level gender target is on page 121 \uf150 .\n\nIn 2018, in response to the HamptonAlexander Review and in recognition of the challenges of its recommendations for the Company due to a very small pipeline of women at the most senior levels, SSE established a series of broader supporting pathway targets for greater gender balance at senior levels to be reached by the end of 2020/21. As shown in the table on this page, there has been mixed progress towards these targets.\n\nThe Hampton-Alexander Review targets 33% female representation within the Group Executive Committee and its Direct Reports by 2020. SSE is fully supportive of this target, but has always understood that, with a low starting point, it would take SSE longer to reach this target. SSE now has 25% senior female representation at this level. This does not however achieve the Hampton-Alexander recommendation or SSE's own target of 30%. SSE's Board and GEC are fully committed to increasing gender balance at this level.",

        "page_content": "## A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH CONTINUED\n\nSSE surpassed its target to have 25% female representation on its GEC, its subcommittees and Business Unit Executive Committees, reaching 28% female representation at the end of 2020/21. Whilst this is positive, SSE intends to make further progress in this area.\n\nSSE has focused on ensuring it has effective inclusive recruitment processes. The percentage of women applying for and being offered senior roles in SSE has increased since 2018/19: from 10% female applications to 17% in 2020/21; and from 6% female offer rates to 18% in the same timeframe. Despite this, and alongside some wider restructuring of the business, the Company did not meet its target to have 20% women out of all people earning \u00a370,000 or above (indexed to 1 April 2017).\n\nSSE believes that important progress has been made on establishing a more inclusive culture through its 'IN, ON and UP' strategy, but knows much remains to be done and understands that the diversity of its senior leaders will take time to change.\n\nHaving completed a significant restructuring of the business portfolio, the Board and GEC are committed to agreeing a future set of ambitions and delivery plans that increase the overall gender diversity and wider difference across leadership and senior management positions, with clear initiatives in place to achieve this.\n\n## SSE's gender pay gap\n\nSSE has published its UK gender pay gap since 2016. SSE's UK median and mean gender pay gap as at 5 April 2021 were 18.3% and 16.5% respectively. This compares to 18.4% and 17.1% respectively as at 5 April 2020.\n\nWhilst SSE publishes its headline gender pay gap statistics within its Annual Report, further data and detailed information on the action SSE is taking to reduce its gender pay gap and promote gender diversity at every level of the organisation can be found within the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Creating an inclusive SSE for ethnic and racial diversity\n\nThe lived experiences of black and ethnic minorities received global focus over the course of 2020. SSE listened to its employees who shared their reactions to last year's Black Lives Matter movement and worked with them to design the best way the Company could offer support and help raise awareness for all.\n\nIn September 2020, SSE launched a new employee led 'Belonging in SSE Black and Ethnic Minority Community', one of a suite of new communities, the shared aims of which are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Bring people together - by encouraging open and constructive employee-led discussion, allowing people to connect, communicate and collaborate.\n- \u00b7 Access latest thinking - by employees sharing relevant and topical insights and knowledge, as well as external articles, studies and thinking.\n- \u00b7 Support each other - by offering peer to peer support and advice amongst those with similar lived experiences.\n- \u00b7 Educate each other - by shining a light on the realities of others who may be different to ourselves.\n\nAlongside this, SSE has encouraged employees to share their lived experiences in short 'By Colleague, For Colleague' personal stories on internal channels to increase shared understanding. This has been accompanied by senior leadership blogs sharing thoughts and experiences around inclusion and difference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consumers\n\nThe provision of energy to homes and businesses across GB and the island of Ireland is an essential service. SSE's relationship with the end consumer can be a direct one, as a supplier of energy or a distributor of electricity. While the relationship between SSE's electricity generation businesses and its Transmission business might be less direct, the interests of the end user are key. From driving down the costs of generating electricity from renewables, the careful balancing of consumer interests in the Transmission business plan to the creation of local flexible electricity grids that engage all users, SSE's businesses can do much to deliver value for consumers.\n\n## New challenges for energy affordability and vulnerability\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated the complex and transient nature of consumer vulnerability. Significant financial challenges have been brought to many of SSE's customers and it has shown how important it is to remain flexible, agile and continually evolve to meet customers' needs.\n\nSSEN Distribution serves over 3.8m customers and adapted its service provision quickly to support customers in 2020/21:\n\n- \u00b7 SSEN's industry-leading customer vulnerability mapping tool was enhanced in 2020/21 with the addition of a new social indicator showing levels of Universal Credit uptake to complement existing data on lowincome and long-term unemployment. The mapping tool was shared widely with partners to inform and support more accurate coronavirus responses.\n- \u00b7 A new joint Priority Services Register (PSR) Scotland website was launched in collaboration with Scottish Water and SP Energy Networks to offer a PSR one-stop-shop across Scotland, making it easier for partners to promote and customers to sign up.\n- \u00b7 A focus on energy efficiency continued, with the trebling of referrals from SSEN to energy efficiency agencies in Scotland and England.\n- \u00b7 SSEN Distribution's partnerships to support vulnerable customers helped 2,754 households in 2020/21. Furthermore, SSEN Distribution extended its energy adviser programme with Citizens Advice Scotland for a further 12 months and enhanced its Citizens Advice Hampshire and NHS Home and Well partnership to specifically target support for people coming out of hospital.",

It also creates opportunities for consumers to manage their energy, with the potential of reducing energy costs. SSE is concerned to ensure however, that these benefits of smart grids are shared widely. Currently access to smart services such as flexibility payments, time-of-use tariffs and electric vehicle tariffs, is limited to a relatively small group of early technology adopters. SSEN Distribution recognises that the benefits of a smarter energy system should be accessible to all and is an important component of achieving a Just Transition to net zero.\n\n'Smart and Fair?' is an ongoing research programme led by the Centre for Sustainable Energy and supported by SSEN Distribution which explores social justice in the future energy system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION ENERGY CUSTOMERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Phase 1 Report, published in September 2020, investigated how this can be achieved without leaving consumers behind. An analytical framework and methodology called a Capability Lens - was developed to measure the impact of changes to the energy system on a diverse group of customers. The research programme has made several recommendations to Ofgem, the UK Government, consumer advocates and energy practitioners (network companies and suppliers), with key findings adopted by the Just Transition Commission's final recommendations to the Scottish Government.\n\nPhase 2 will improve the analytical tools, pilot interventions to widen participation and analysis of the value of the smart energy market to a range of different stakeholders. It will determine whether the analytical framework can be used 'in reverse' to develop profiles of communities, types of smart energy offerings and model types of interventions that may be required.",

It therefore provided its strategic suppliers with the opportunity to review and provide comment on its new Sustainable Procurement Code and accompanying Supplier Guidance (both available on sse. com/sustainability/policies-assurances \uf295 ) ahead of publication.\n\nReaching out to SSE's strategic supply partners, input was requested on overarching themes, principles and specific requirements outlined in the documents. Ten suppliers provided detailed feedback\n\n## Suppliers\n\nSSE depends upon a sustainable, vibrant and varied supply chain to deliver its business strategy. Ensuring that its standards and values are supported and upheld by its suppliers and contractors is central to the social impact SSE makes.\n\n## Renewing SSE's sustainable procurement strategy\n\nThe ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Guidance was identified as the most appropriate framework to structure a renewed and invigorated approach to managing sustainability risks and opportunities in SSE's supply chain. Following an independent gap analysis against the ISO 20400 standard by supply chain experts Action Sustainability in early 2020, over the course of 2020/21 SSE has developed and begun implementation of a three-part plan designed to advance its approach to sustainable procurement to a mature state. Detail of this plan is provided in the Sustainability Report 2021.\n\nCore activities undertaken during 2020/21 to advance SSE's approach to sustainable procurement included:\n\n- \u00b7 An extensive assessment of social and environmental risks across all purchasing categories to identify where the most material risks lie and enabling proactive risk mitigation.\n\nwhich was subsequently integrated into the documents, with agreement to continue engagement on this topic to understand potential areas of collaboration to fulfil common sustainability goals.\n\n## DETAILED FEEDBACK FROM\n\n10\n\nstrategic suppliers helped shape SSE's Sustainable Procurement Code\n\n- \u00b7 Creation of advanced sustainabilityfocused pre-qualification and tender question sets and KPI measures, designed to target shared opportunities as well as risk.\n- \u00b7 Development of a new Sustainable Procurement Code and linked Supplier Guidance document (replacing SSE's Responsible Procurement Charter) which are aligned to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) material to SSE's business.\n- \u00b7 A proposal to work with supply chain partners on SSE's major projects to quantify and enhance the social value of SSE's major project investment.\n- \u00b7 Partnership with the Supply Chain Sustainability School to enable SSE and its supply chain to access high-quality training, wider resources and networks focused on sustainability.\n\n## Supporting local supply chains on offshore wind projects\n\nFor more than a decade, SSE has demonstrated its commitment to developing sustainable, domestic supply chains for its major infrastructure projects. SSE reached financial investment decisions on just under \u00a310bn of renewables projects in 2020/21, with SSE's share representing around \u00a34.5bn. The opportunities for supporting and creating UK supply chains and jobs as a result of these projects, in particular Seagreen and Dogger Bank offshore wind farms, has been a major strategic focus for the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS AND PARTNERS\n\nThe most significant development, in March 2021, was the announcement that GE Renewable Energy plans to open a new blade manufacturing plant on Teesside in the North East of England to support the growing offshore wind market in the UK and Europe and to produce blades for its Haliade-X turbine that will power Dogger Bank. The significant order of Haliade-X offshore wind turbines from Dogger Bank wind farm was a decisive factor in GE Renewable Energy's decision to greenlight the new manufacturing plant, delivering a long-term renewable energy jobs boost to the region. The blade factory is expected to create up to 750 direct and up to 1,500 indirect jobs locally.\n\n## Communities\n\nSSE's long-standing approach to community engagement and investment has enabled it to build strong relationships with communities in the areas where it operates.\n\n## Implementing responsible developer principles\n\nSSE's business strategy depends upon its ability to develop and execute major infrastructure projects from new electricity transmission lines to wind farms. The successful development of such projects requires good community relationships with the people who live near the projects.\n\nSSE's approach to community liaison has been built over the past 10 years with a Large Capital Project governance",

Feedback has demonstrated improved inclusion of communities who may have struggled to attend in-person events due to childcare, distance or work commitments.\n\nIn the future, the model is expected to develop further as stakeholders confirm they value some face-to-face engagement.

Over 2020/21, \u00a310.2m of community investment grants were administered by SSE Renewables to finance 980 projects across the UK and Ireland. Total fund payments between 2008 and 2050 are expected to be at least \u00a3250m, adjusted for inflation. This includes the Viking wind farm fund, with expected payments to the Shetland community over the lifetime of the wind farm totalling \u00a370m (nominal) - the largest UK community fund linked to renewable energy.\n\nIn addition to the SSE Renewables funds, SSEN Distribution operates the Resilient Communities Fund (RCF) which helps\n\n## PROVIDING EMERGENCY FUNDING IN A TIME OF NEED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE has supported communities quickly and flexibly throughout the pandemic. Early in 2020, SSE engaged communities near its renewable assets to understand how the community investment could best support them to respond to immediate challenges. Based on the communities' suggestion, emergency funding was made available with over \u00a32m provided in emergency grants to assist community responses throughout the pandemic. More than 250 communities were supported to manufacture PPE, retain community assets and to provide essential services for vulnerable residents.\n\nBeyond the granting of emergency funds, SSE's Community Investment Team engaged existing grant holders and determined how best to support them during the pandemic. The grant award\n\nperiod for over 100 existing grants was extended and additional funding was made available to 38 groups to help them respond to consequences of the pandemic, for example providing youth support services and training for the self-employed.\n\nSSE is now engaging with communities to ensure they are supported as they seek to stabilise and thrive during the recovery period.\n\nSSE HAS MADE MORE THAN\n\n## \u00a32m\n\navailable since March 2020 to support communities with their coronavirus pandemic response\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION NGOs, COMMUNITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncommunities to build resilience for emergency events and protect the welfare of vulnerable community members. Since 2015, the RCF has provided \u00a32.8m to 540 not-for-profit community groups and charities in SSEN's electricity distribution network areas in central southern England and the North of Scotland. Over 2020/21, the fund was used to support communities' responses to the coronavirus pandemic, with over \u00a3320k granted through the RCF and an additional \u00a340k granted to Citizens Advice Scotland and Citizens Advice Hampshire to help them transition to home working and develop their capacity and resilience to deliver the increased demand for remote services.",

This, combined with a resilient business model, helped the Group manage and minimise the human, operational and financial impacts of coronavirus and to meet its objective of supporting the reliable supply of electricity to those who needed it, particularly those tackling the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to coronavirus, SSE managed and assessed the potential risks associated with a number of other external factors throughout the year. Brexit gave rise to a high degree of economic, regulatory and political change. SSE was well prepared and the direct impacts were limited, but it continues to manage the resulting uncertainty over carbon pricing and the establishment of a standalone UK Emissions Trading System agreement.\n\nSSE also appealed to the CMA on a narrow range of technical points against Ofgem's final RIIO-T2 price control determination, seeking to balance affordability for energy consumers with the need to attract the investment needed for the transition to net zero.\n\nAgainst this backdrop SSE continued to deliver significant strategic progress through its disposals and capex programmes. The Group has been streamlined and \u00a31.5bn of proceeds have been announced through the sale of non-core assets and construction is under way on a number of predominantly low-carbon infrastructure projects including the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank.\n\nThe above factors, along with the likely longer-term impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK, Ireland and abroad and all other influencing factors formed the basis of the full review of SSE's Principal Risks that took place during the financial year.\n\n## Board considerations\n\nEffective identification, understanding and mitigation of Principal Risks underpins the Board's approach to setting strategic objectives for SSE and informing strategic decision making. The Board aims to consider all material influencing factors and key external trends in the energy market, including those relating to climate change, technological developments and capital flow and aims to do so in a way that reflects the expectations of SSE's key stakeholder groups.\n\nThese material influencing factors also have an impact on the nature and extent of risks the Board is willing to take in order to meet these objectives, and related mitigation strategies adopted by the Group. Material changes in the nature and potential impacts of SSE's Group Principal Risks are regularly assessed with appropriate mitigations implemented where necessary.\n\n## Overseeing risk\n\nThe Group Executive Committee and its sub-committees have responsibility for overseeing SSE's Principal Risks. During the third quarter of SSE's financial year, an assessment of each Principal Risk is completed by the assigned oversight committee. This assessment requires committee members to provide commentary on contextual changes to the risks and whether they consider them to have become more or less material during the year. In 20/21 this commentary covered both changes specifically related to coronavirus and those changes that are not related to the pandemic impacts. Consideration is also given to potential emerging risks and whether or not any of those identified have the potential to become a Principal Risk to the business in the medium- to long-term.\n\nThese responses are then consolidated into reports, one for each Principal Risk, which are presented back to the committees along with the results of provisional viability testing and analysis of relevant, current management information and\n\nkey information relating to Business Unit Principal Risks and Controls. These reports form the basis for the committees to discuss and confirm the risk trend (more, less or equally material), overall effectiveness of the risk control and monitoring environment, and whether any additional control improvement actions are required. This is an inclusive and iterative process that results in considered and objective outputs and a robust assessment of Principal Risks.\n\nThe outputs from these committee assessments are then presented to the Group Executive Committee for full review, with any emerging risks or additional material changes resulting from this being proposed to the Board.\n\n## 2020/21 review outcome\n\nFollowing the 2020/21 annual review process, the number of Principal Risks to the Group remains at 11 but there are two revisions of note.\n\nThe 'Large Capital Projects Quality' risk has been redefined and renamed 'Large Capital Projects Management'. This broadens the risk definition in response to changes in the operating environment and reflects the increase in value of SSE's Large Capital Projects portfolio over the next 10 years.\n\nThe emerging risk 'Joint Venture and Partner Management' previously identified during 2019/20 was retained by the Board. The importance of joint ventures and partner management continues to increase in SSE as its Business Units pursue their strategic and business objectives in association with other companies and organisations, in some cases in international markets. An additional review of this emerging risk will be undertaken by the Group Risk Committee in Q2 of the financial year 21/22.\n\nImportant revisions have also been made to the descriptions of each of the other Principal Risks to take account of key developments and corresponding mitigations that were introduced during the year. Full details of the Group Principal Risks are available on pages 57 to 63 \uf150 .",

        "page_content": "## RISK/hyphen.caseINFORMED DECISION MAKING CONTINUED\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nNo business is risk free and indeed the achievement of SSE's strategic objectives necessarily involves taking risk. SSE will however only accept risk where it is consistent with its core purpose, strategy and values; is well understood; can be effectively managed; with consideration of stakeholder expectations and offers commensurate reward.\n\nThe sectors in which SSE operates continue to be subject to a high degree of political, regulatory and legislative risk as well as risks arising from other developments and change including technology, the impact of competition, stakeholders' evolving expectations and climate change.\n\nFurthermore, each of SSE's Business Units have differing levels of exposure to additional risks. For example, the SSEN Transmission and Distribution businesses are largely economically regulated and are characterised by relatively stable, inflation linked cash flows while the SSE Renewables business benefits from cash flows linked to government-mandated renewables subsidies. Those Business Units that generate and trade energy are also exposed to significant medium- to long-term energy market and commodity risks in operational and investment decision making.\n\nThe key elements of SSE's Strategic Framework - including the focus on regulated energy networks and renewable sources of energy, particularly clean electricity, complemented by flexible thermal generation and business energy sales - and its financial objective in relation to dividend growth are fully reflective of its risk appetite.\n\n## Fundamentally:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE is focused on creating value in a sustainable way from developing, building, operating and investing in the energy infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero. This provides a complementary portfolio of business activities whilst keeping the depth of focus on a single sector - energy.\n- \u00b7 SSE has a clear understanding of the risks and opportunities in the Great Britain and Ireland energy markets and these markets therefore continue to provide the Group's geographic focus, with any expansion into other markets being subject to especially rigorous scrutiny.\n- \u00b7 Safety is SSE's first value and it has no appetite for risks brought on by unsafe actions, nor does it have any appetite for risks brought on by insecure actions including those relating to cyber security.\n\nIn areas where SSE is exposed to risks for which it has little or no appetite, even though it has implemented high standards of control and mitigation, the nature of these risks mean that they cannot be eliminated completely.\n\nIn determining its appetite for specific risks, the Board is guided by three key principles:\n\n- 1.  Risks should be consistent with SSE's core purpose, financial objectives, strategy and values;\n- 2.  Risks should only be accepted where relevant approvals have been attained through the Governance Framework to confirm appropriate reward is achievable on the basis of objective evidence and in a manner that is consistent with SSE's purpose, strategy and values; and\n- 3.  Risks should be actively controlled and monitored through the appropriate allocation of management and other resources, underpinned by the maintenance of a healthy business culture.\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risk it is willing to take and for ensuring that risks are managed effectively across the Group.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nSSE is a purpose-led company involved principally in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; and also in the supply of energy and related services to customers. Its strategy is to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero. The delivery of SSE's purpose and execution of its strategy depends on the skills and talent of a diverse workforce, the quality of its assets and the effective identification, understanding and mitigation of risk.\n\nAs required within provision 41 of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Board has formally assessed the prospects of the Company over the next 3 financial years to the period ending March 2024. The Directors have determined that as this time horizon aligns with the Group's current capital programme and is within the strategy planning period, a greater degree of confidence over the forecasting assumptions modelled can be established.\n\nIn making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group taking into account its current position, the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, the Principal Risks facing the Group and\n\nthe control measures in place to mitigate each of them. In particular the Directors recognise the significance of the strong balance sheet, and total committed lending facilities of \u00a31.5bn - with \u00a3200m committed to October 2025 and \u00a31.3bn committed to March 2026. The Group is an owner and operator of critical national infrastructure and has a proven ability to maintain access to capital markets during stressed economic conditions. The Group has demonstrated this through securing \u00a32.5bn of funding since April 2020 including the issuance of a dual tranche \u00a3500m Eurobond in March 2021, its fourth Green bond in 5 years.\n\nThe Group has a number of highly attractive and relatively liquid assets including a regulated asset base which benefits from a strong regulated revenue stream as well as the operational wind portfolio - which provide flexibility of options. This has been demonstrated through the success of the programme of disposals set out by the Group in June 2020 with already agreed disposals of noncore assets expected to yield over \u00a31.5bn in net proceeds, of which over \u00a31.4bn cash proceeds have been received to date.\n\nTo help support this Statement, over the course of the year a suite of severe but plausible scenarios has been developed for each of SSE's Principal Risks. These scenarios are based on relevant real life events that have been observed either in the markets within which the Group operates or related markets globally. Examples include critical asset failure (for Energy Infrastructure Failure); changes to key government energy policies (for Politics, Regulation & Compliance); and the impact of the loss of key systems (for Cyber Security and Resilience).\n\nScenarios are stress tested against forecast available financial headroom which this year also considered sensitivities resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Further details can be found in A6.3 (Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Accounts). In addition to considering these in isolation, the Directors also consider the cumulative impact of different combinations of scenarios, including those that individually have the highest impact.\n\nUpon the basis of the analysis undertaken, and on the assumption that the fundamental regulatory and statutory framework of the markets in which the Group operates does not substantively change, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the period to March 2024.",

SSE is the UK's largest corporate issuer of green bonds and is the only UK corporate to launch multiple green bonds. During the year SSE also set out a new framework for issuing innovative sustainability-linked bonds in the future.\n\n## Key mitigations:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy Link: SSE Financial Management Policy.\n- \u00b7 Committed borrowings and facilities are available at all times equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 6 month period.\n- \u00b7 SSE seeks to maintain a diverse and innovative portfolio of debt to avoid over-reliance on any one market. This allows it to build relationships with, and create competition between, debt providers.\n- \u00b7 Each of SSE's defined benefit pension schemes has a Board of Trustees which acts independently of the Group.\n\n## Key developments:\n\n- \u00b7 Following an independent assessment against ISO 20400 by supply chain experts Action Sustainability in early 2020, SSE has developed and begun implementation of a three-part plan designed to mature its approach to sustainable procurement. For further details please see the Sustainability Report \uf223 .\n\n## Key developments associated with coronavirus:\n\n- \u00b7 Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic the Group reached Final Investment Decisions (FID) on a number of significant projects including the Seagreen 1 and Dogger Bank A and B offshore windfarms.\n\n## Key mitigations:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy Link: SSE's Large Capital Projects Governance Framework manual ensures that all major capital investment projects for the Group are governed, developed, approved and executed in a consistent and effective manner, with full consideration of best practice project delivery. The manual, which was reviewed in detail during the year, with support from a specialist third party, provides common standards across the Group and incorporates continuous improvement practices.\n- \u00b7 The Large Capital Project Services function employs dedicated quality and assurance teams who perform in-depth quality reviews.\n- \u00b7 In major projects, SSE generally manages insurance placement by organising owner controlled insurance. This strategy allows it to have greater control and flexibility over the provisions in place. SSE also sees the insurance market as an important source of information on the reliability of technology and uses this to inform the design process of major projects.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## PERFORMING THROUGH A CHALLENGING YEAR\n\nDespite a year of exceptional challenges faced by the global economy, the following pages reflect a period of significant strategic progress for SSE and value creation for its shareholders.\n\nWe can be very proud of the performance delivered in 2020/21. Against the backdrop of a global pandemic, we delivered strong earnings, made significant strategic progress and developed value-creating opportunities associated with net zero right across the energy value chain.\n\nThe resilience of SSE's business model and the commitment of our employees have helped us weather the coronavirus storm with the financial impact on the Group restricted to \u00a3170m.\n\nWe saw strong underlying performance in our core renewables and networks businesses and, while the long-term implications from the pandemic remain uncertain, the ongoing cost is likely to felt largely in SSE Enterprise and SSE Business Energy, and any future impact will be assumed within normal business performance.\n\nThose core renewables and networks businesses accounted for \u00a31,220m of adjusted operating profit - around 80% of the Group total of \u00a31,506m, which itself was up 1% year-on-year. A marked increase in Group reported operating profit, up 185% at \u00a32,743m, reflects mark-to-market gains on derivatives but also underlines the value we have created for shareholders through our disposals programme. As well as sharpening the Group's net zero focus, strategicallydriven disposals in the region of \u00a31.5bn have been announced and we expect to exceed our \u00a32bn target on completion of the sale of SGN.\n\nIn addition to well-executed disposals, we showed in 2020/21 that our increasing developer focus opens opportunities for creating value through effective financial partnering in renewables. The sale of stakes in Dogger Bank A and B raised just over \u00a3200m, we partnered with Total at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'These results provide a platform for us to pursue the opportunities we see arising from the transition to net zero.'\n\nSeagreen and we expect to sell a stake in Dogger Bank C during the first half of the financial year. We have been clear that we would also consider, in time, extending a partnering approach potentially through sales of minority stakes in our regulated electricity networks businesses.\n\nThe \u00a37.5bn capital investment and expenditure plan, meanwhile, is on track and we expect the run rate for capex to increase in 2021/22 and 2022/23 to around \u00a32bn in each year. Success of the capex plan can be seen in the excellent progress being made on Dogger Bank, Seagreen and Viking wind farms. Thanks to these flagship renewables projects, we are building more offshore wind than anyone else in the world. At the same time, our regulated networks businesses are pushing ahead with plans to support the transition to net zero in the RIIO-T2 and RIIO-ED2 regulatory price control periods.\n\nOn the basis that financial performance in 2020/21 met the Board's expectations, we have recommended a full-year dividend of 81.0p and we are targeting RPI increases over the next two financial years, as set out in our 2023 dividend plan.\n\nCombined, these results provide a platform for us to pursue the opportunities we see arising from the transition to net zero. We have options available to us to make the most of those opportunities and the best interests of shareholders will continue to be met through effective capital allocation, optimal capital recycling and partnering, and sound financial management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGregor Alexander Finance Director 25 May 2021",

        "page_content": "## Impact from coronavirus\n\nCoronavirus has had a significant impact on every company operating in the UK and Ireland, but, relative to other companies, SSE has been resilient in the face of the pandemic and it has not prevented the Group from making progress on its strategy.\n\nCorrespondingly, in line with the expectations set out in the June 2020 Preliminary Full-Year Results, financial performance in the Group's Transmission, Renewables and Thermal businesses has not been significantly adversely impacted by coronavirus. However, as reported throughout the year, the pandemic has caused greater challenges for SSE's other businesses. The full-year impact on operating profit is estimated to be \u00a3170m, slightly below the estimate provided in SSE's March Notification of Closed Period and mainly due to better than expected demand in Distribution.\n\nThe adjusted financial metrics include the effect of coronavirus, with estimated adverse impacts for each business area as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 In SSEN Distribution , operating profit has been reduced by approximately \u00a340m, principally due to reduced DUoS revenue resulting from reduced customer demand although reduced connection activity also contributed. It is expected that around \u00a334m of this decrease will be recoverable through tariff adjustments in 2022/23 under established regulatory arrangements in relation to uncollected DUoS revenue.\n- \u00b7 In SSE Business Energy , operating profit has been impacted by approximately \u00a380m due to a combination of reduced demand, increased bad debts and \u00a324m of losses incurred on early settlement of excess commodity hedges with negative mark-to-market valuations.\n- \u00b7 In SSE Enterprise , the Contracting and Rail and, to a lesser extent Telecoms, businesses have been impacted by approximately \u00a340m due, primarily, to a reduced contracting order book and lower overall activity.\n- \u00b7 In SGN , reduced activity has led to approximately a \u00a35m share of unproductive costs.\n- \u00b7 For Corporate Unallocated , incremental and unproductive costs incurred are estimated at \u00a35m.\n\nWhile the long-term economic implications from the coronavirus pandemic are still uncertain, SSE expects the ongoing impact to the Group from the pandemic to be restricted to the performance of SSE Business Energy and SSE Enterprise and it\n\nwill therefore be assumed within normal business performance from 2021/22.\n\n## Operating profit - including coronavirus impact\n\nAdjusted and reported operating profit/ losses in SSE's business segments for the 12 months to 31 March 2021 are as set out below; comparisons are with the same 12 months to 31 March 2020 unless otherwise stated.\n\nSSEN Transmission: Adjusted and reported operating profit increased by 1% to \u00a3220.9m, compared to \u00a3218.1m, with increases in phasing of allowed revenue and increased connection activity being offset by increased operational costs and depreciation charges driven by the significant capital investment made in this business in recent years.\n\nSSEN Distribution: Adjusted operating profit decreased by 25% to \u00a3267.3m, compared to \u00a3356.3m, mainly due to the reduction in volumes across nondomestic tariffs reflecting the impact of national and regional lockdowns but also due to reduced new connections activity and increased depreciation charges driven by prior year capital investment. In addition, phasing of changes in tariffs and volumes between reporting periods has meant an over-recovery of \u00a337m in 2019/20 was replaced with a \u00a328m net under-recovery in 2020/21. We have estimated that approximately \u00a334m of this was coronavirus related and, under the established regulatory arrangements in relation to uncollected DUoS revenue, future tariffs will be adjusted for any historic over or under recoveries.\n\nIn the prior year, reported operating profit included a non-recurring \u00a34.4m exceptional charge for restructuring expenses.\n\nInvestment in SGN: Adjusted operating profit decreased by 14% to \u00a3173.0m, compared to \u00a3202.3m, due to a combination of reduction in non-recurring commercial income from the disposal of surplus land, cost increases driven by changes in the charging methodology and reduced activity from coronavirus leading to higher unproductive costs being incurred.\n\nThe decreases to adjusted operating profit were largely offset by a \u00a337.1m reduction in SSE's share of SGN interest, tax and IFRS 9 remeasurements. As a result, reported operating profit was \u00a388.6m compared to \u00a380.8m.\n\nSSE Renewables: Adjusted operating profit increased by 29% to \u00a3731.8m, compared to \u00a3567.3m. 2020/21 includes developer profits totalling \u00a3226m resulting from the disposal of a 51% stake in the Seagreen offshore wind farm development on 3 June 2020 and a 10% stake in the Dogger Bank A and B offshore wind farm development on 26 February 2021. Excluding these, operating profit decreased due to a combination of the Walney disposal and adverse weather conditions reducing output by 10% on prior year, partially offset by higher plant availability and higher achieved power prices.\n\nReported operating profit was \u00a3856.0m compared to \u00a3459.9m. In addition to the factors outlined above, this reflects an exceptional gain resulting from the disposal of the Group's financial interest in the Walney offshore wind farm of \u00a3188.8m, and a fair value gain of \u00a325.7m arising on revaluation of the retained 49% investment in the Seagreen offshore wind farm development. In addition, joint venture share of interest and tax charges decreased by \u00a322.0m compared to the prior year.\n\nThermal Generation: Adjusted operating profit increased by 5% to \u00a3160.5m, compared to \u00a3152.7m. Strong operational performance in the year, combined with higher utilisation to stabilise the energy system in periods of low generation or high demand, and a \u00a320.4m developer profit on the non-exceptional disposal of a 50% sale in Slough Multifuel on 2 April 2020 entirely offset the \u00a351m of non-recurring GB Capacity Market reinstatement income received in the prior year.\n\nReported operating profit increased to \u00a3775.3m, compared to \u00a315.5m, due to the above factors and in addition: an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3669.7m on the sale of Multifuel Energy; a fair value gain of \u00a321.3m arising on revaluation of the retained 50% investment in Slough Multifuel; a \u00a358.1m exceptional impairment charge recognised for Great Island CCGT plant following reductions in forward price curves and reductions in forecast electricity demand in Ireland; and a \u00a3112.3m net exceptional charge recognised in 2019/20 for Fiddlers Ferry coal station following the decision to close the plant in March 2020.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nGas Storage: An adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(5.7)m was recognised in the year, compared to an adjusted operating profit of \u00a33.7m in the prior period. As with the prior year, this year's auction of storage capacity resulted in no contracted sales, with SSE therefore continuing to run the plant on a merchant basis. The adjusted operating loss recognised reflects market conditions during the year as well as higher levels of gas retained in storage over the year end.\n\nReported operating profit was \u00a32.8m as a result of a \u00a38.5m revaluation gain on gas held in storage at the period end to fair market price.\n\nSSE Business Energy: Adjusted operating loss was \u00a3(24.0)m, compared to an adjusted operating profit of \u00a39.2m in the prior year. As previously noted coronavirus reduced customers' demand for electricity and related services, increased the levels of bad debt and led to a loss of approximately \u00a324m being incurred on early settlement of excess commodity hedges with negative mark-to-market valuations. This more than offset the underlying increase in profitability from improvements in margin discipline.\n\nThe reported operating loss was \u00a3(3.9)m, compared to \u00a3(18.5)m, due to the above factors and in addition a \u00a320.1m release during 2020/21 from the \u00a327.7m exceptional charge relating to bad debts arising from coronavirus that was previously recognised in 2019/20. Whilst the original charge reflected the Group's best estimate of the incremental bad debt exposure caused by the coronavirus pandemic at that date, higher cash collections in recovery of debt were achieved during the year largely due to government support schemes and other factors.\n\nSSE Airtricity: Adjusted operating profit was \u00a344.0m, compared to \u00a348.8m, reflecting a delay in increasing tariffs despite increased non-commodity costs from October 2020 onwards.\n\nReported operating profit was \u00a350.0m, compared to \u00a342.8m, due to the above factors and also including the release in full of a \u00a36.0m exceptional provision relating to bad debts arising from coronavirus that was previously recognised in 2019/20.\n\n## Energy Portfolio Management (EPM):\n\nAdjusted operating profit was \u00a318.4m, compared to an adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(60.3)m. The 2019/20 result reflected the last of the losses related to gas positions closed out in 2018. As previously stated,\n\nEPM was expected to earn a small adjusted operating profit from 2020/21 onwards through service provision to those SSE businesses requiring access to the energy markets.\n\nThe adjusted and reported operating result for both the current and prior period includes the previously separately presented 'Gas Production (continuing)' results. The associated hedges contributed a net \u00a320.4m of income for EPM during the year and have now fully unwound.\n\nReported operating profit was \u00a3608.5m, compared to a reported operating loss of \u00a3(94.5)m, mainly due to a higher net remeasurement gain in the period on forward commodity contracts. This net remeasurement gain reflects settlement of previously out of the money commodity contracts and gains on unsettled forward commodity contracts, which were entered into during 2019/20 and 2020/21 in line with the Group's hedging approach, that will be settled predominantly within the next 12-18 months.\n\nSSE Enterprise: Adjusted operating loss was \u00a3(21.3)m, compared to an adjusted operating profit of \u00a38.1m, mainly reflecting the impact coronavirus has had on activity within the Contracting and Rail business in particular.\n\nReported operating loss in the year was \u00a3(106.7)m, compared to \u00a3(2.0)m in the prior year due to the factors above as well as an exceptional impairment charge of \u00a351.2m relating to Contracting and Rail assets and liabilities following classification as held for sale and a \u00a321.8m exceptional charge arising from the Group's investment in the Neos Networks Joint Venture (previously SSE Telecoms). These exceptional charges include impairment charges recognised within adjusted operating losses as part of SSE's Interim Results for the six months to 30 September 2020 as they did not meet SSE's exceptional item criteria at that time.\n\nCorporate Unallocated: Adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(58.4)m, compared to \u00a3(17.8)m and reflecting a change in the recovery of corporate costs following the sale of SSE Energy Services on 15 January 2020 as well as a small impact from coronavirus.\n\nReported operating loss was \u00a3(15.3)m, compared to a loss of \u00a3(89.2)m. In the current year, an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a370.4m was recognised relating to MapleCo Meter Asset Provider offset by a further \u00a324.2m charge from the disposal of SSE Energy Services from further IT\n\nseparation costs and property impairments. In the prior year, exceptional charges recognised related to both the disposal of SSE Energy Services of \u00a348.8m and exceptional IT write-offs and redundancy provisions totalling \u00a341.2m.\n\nInvestment in Gas Production - held for sale (discontinued operations): The assets held for sale had a reported operating profit of \u00a333.0m, compared to a loss of \u00a3(265.5)m, which is excluded from SSE's adjusted results. Revenue had significantly decreased as a result of lower gas prices in recent years; however, increases in gas prices in recent months have resulted in increased revenue during the year. However, the prior year reported result also included a \u00a3291.3m exceptional impairment to reduce the carrying value of the business to its expected recoverable value from disposal. As the business remains held for sale, depreciation has not been charged during 2020/21, compared to a depreciation charge of \u00a331.1m recognised prior to held for sale classification in 2019/20.\n\n## Adjusted Earnings per share Adjusted Earnings per share including coronavirus impact\n\nTo monitor its financial performance over the medium term, SSE reports on its adjusted earnings per share measure. This measure is calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest costs on net pension liabilities, exceptional items, depreciation on fair value adjustments and the impact of certain remeasurements.\n\nSSE's adjusted EPS measure provides an important and meaningful measure of underlying financial performance. In adjusting for depreciation on fair value adjustments, non-recurring joint venture refinancing costs, exceptional items and certain remeasurements, adjusted EPS reflects SSE's internal performance management, avoids the volatility associated with mark-to-market IFRS 9 remeasurements and means that items deemed to be exceptional due to their nature and scale do not distort the presentation of SSE's underlying results. For more detail on these and other adjusted items please refer to the Adjusted Performance Measures section of this statement.\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2021, SSE's adjusted earnings per share on continuing operations was 87.5p, after the negative impact on pre-tax operating profit from coronavirus estimated at \u00a3170m in the year to 31 March 2021 (or around 13 pence on adjusted EPS). This compares to 83.6p",

        "page_content": "for the year to 31 March 2020 and reflects the developer profits recognised by SSE Renewables and reduction in the EPMrelated losses offset by the impact from coronavirus as outlined above.\n\n## Group financial outlook 2021/22 and beyond Key points\n\n- \u00b7 SSE remains committed to its five-year dividend plan to March 2023.\n- \u00b7 SSE is not providing full guidance for 2021/22 at this stage but expects the ongoing impact to the Group from the coronavirus pandemic to be mainly restricted to the performance of Enterprise and Business Energy, where it will be assumed within normal business performance and no longer separately reported.\n- \u00b7 Completion of the agreed disposals of non-core assets in SSE's Contracting and Rail business, and SSE's Gas Production assets, expected by the end of June 2021 and the end of this calendar year respectively.\n- \u00b7 Expected to commence a disposal process for all of SSE's interest in SGN during mid-summer 2021, with the intention of having an agreed sale by the end of the calendar year.\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment is expected to total around \u00a32bn in 2021/22 (net of project finance development expenditure refunds).\n- \u00b7 Continuing to target a ratio of net debt to EBITDA at the lower end of a 4.5 to 5 times range between 2021/22 and 2024/25.\n- \u00b7 SSE remains committed to delivering its \u00a37.5bn capital investment plan to 2025; indeed much of this is now contracted, but there is considerable potential for future growth above and beyond.\n- \u00b7 As emerging opportunities in SSE's core businesses become clearer in the coming months, SSE expects to be able to provide an update on its capital investment plans in November.\n\n## Maintaining a strong balance sheet and creating value\n\n## SSE'S programme to securing value from disposals of non-core assets\n\nSince 2014, SSE has undertaken a series of targeted disposals of non-core assets and businesses as part of its strategy to simplify the SSE Group; sharpen its focus on businesses supporting the transition to net zero emissions; recycle capital from mature assets; realise value from development and operation of assets; and establish partnerships to support investment in new assets. In total, since 2014, these have secured proceeds in excess of \u00a34.9bn.\n\nIn June 2020, the Group announced a target to achieve disposal proceeds from non-core assets in excess of \u00a32bn. Since this announcement, agreement has been reached to divest a number of non-core businesses and assets, which is expected to yield over \u00a31.5bn of proceeds with over \u00a31.4bn cash proceeds received to date. The following agreed disposals are expected to complete during the next financial year:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE's Contracting and Rail business, with the sale process expected to be completed by the end of June 2021; and\n- \u00b7 SSE's Gas Production assets, with the sale process expected to be completed by the end of this calendar year.\n\nSGN is expected to be the next material disposal. Whilst the business has a stable foundation that is set to benefit from increased hydrogen usage in the future, it is a financial investment for SSE, run largely independently and the synergies with the Group's low-carbon electricity businesses are less clear. As SSE set out in its March Pre-Close Statement, it is planning to divest all of its interest in the business and it now expects to commence a formal sale process in mid-summer 2021 with the intention of having an agreed sale by the end of the calendar year. The market will be updated on the prospective sale in due course.\n\n## SSE'S \u00a37.5bn capital investment plan to 2025\n\nSSE is now in the second year of its \u00a37.5bn capital investment plan to March 2025. During the year to 31 March 2021, SSE's investment and capital expenditure (net of project financing development expenditure refunds) totalled \u00a3912.0m. As indicated in SSE's interim results in November, this lower run rate is expected to reverse in 2021/22 when investment and capital expenditure (net of project financing development expenditure refunds) is expected to be around \u00a32bn.\n\nSSE remains committed to delivering its \u00a37.5bn capital investment plan to 2025, indeed much of this is now contracted. Furthermore, the quality of SSE's net zero aligned assets and pipeline means there is considerable potential for future growth above and beyond this. For instance, the following are examples of potential opportunities not currently included in the \u00a37.5bn plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Three significant SSEN Transmission projects for which SSE plans to submit needs cases to Ofgem over the summer;\n- \u00b7 Potential Transmission island links to Orkney and the Western Isles;\n- \u00b7 SSE Renewables' opportunities to increase its pipeline of projects;\n- \u00b7 Emerging options in Governmentbacked carbon capture and storage competitive processes; and\n- \u00b7 SSE's distributed energy opportunities to invest in battery technology.\n\nAs these emerging opportunities become clearer in the coming months, SSE expects to be able to provide an update on its capital investment plans in November. SSE has repeatedly demonstrated through effective capital allocation and optimal capital recycling and partnering that it can take advantage of the opportunities it creates within its existing financial framework. With a wealth of assets and options, a strong financial position and strong credit rating, and the ability to partner strategically and financially, SSE has every confidence in its ability to continue to deliver on future opportunities.\n\n## Securing value from partnering\n\nAs mentioned above, SSE continues to regard partnering capability as vital for the future and an important means of unlocking future opportunities in its core businesses. Through SSE Renewables, SSE will continue its established approach to partnering to capitalise on the significant development opportunities ahead related to net zero.\n\nSSE is well placed to manage development risk but selling down stakes to retain typically 30-40% equity interest in a project and working with equity partners for construction, and/or operation brings a number of benefits: it allows SSE to secure developer premiums and realise value at the earliest opportunity; it reduces overall risk and financial exposure on large-scale projects; it avoids a large increase in net debt that is not earning; and it appeals to the different risk appetites of different partners at different stages of the project cycle.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nThe sale of a 10% equity stake in Dogger Bank A and B during 2020/21 showed the value SSE can create through partnering, bringing in just over \u00a3200m of cash proceeds and developer profits. It expects to progress with the sale of an equivalent equity stake in Dogger Bank C during the first half of 2021/22.\n\nSSE has previously been clear that it would also consider, in time, extending a partnering approach potentially through sales of equity stakes in its core SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution businesses, should it consider that the released capital could facilitate the realisation of greater growth opportunities across its core businesses. Any sales would be of minority stakes, enabling SSE to retain the lead role in relation to governance and also operational control, but would only be pursued if deemed to be in the interests of customers, the electricity system as a whole, and shareholders to do so.\n\n## Dividend\n\n## Dividend plan\n\nSSE's first financial objective has always been to remunerate shareholders for their investment through the payment of dividends.\n\nOverall, financial performance in the year was in line with the Board's expectations and, on that basis, SSE is recommending a full-year dividend of 81.0p representing an average annual RPI rate of 1.2%.\n\nSSE continues to target RPI increases in the next two financial years, measured against the average annual rate of RPI inflation, as set out in its 2023 dividend plan.\n\nLonger term, SSE continues to believe that the core businesses of the SSE Group provide a good foundation to support dividends to shareholders. They will therefore underpin SSE's ability to create value for shareholders over the long term.\n\n## Scrip dividend scheme\n\nThe scrip dividend uptake during 2020/21 was:\n\n- \u00b7 4% for the 2019/20 final dividend;\n- \u00b7 5% for the 2020/21 interim dividend; and\n- \u00b7 The interim and final scrip take-up resulted in a \u00a339.0m saving in dividend payments.\n\nIn June 2020, SSE confirmed that it would not buy back shares even if uptake of the Scrip Dividend exceeds 20% and this remains unchanged.\n\n## Supplemental financial information\n\nAdjusted investment and capex summary\n\n## Investment and capital expenditure\n\n|                                                               | March   2021   Share %   | March   2021   \u00a3m   | March   2020   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| SSEN Transmission                                             | 33%                      | 435.2               | 329.0               |\n| SSEN Distribution                                             | 26%                      | 350.8               | 364.9               |\n| Electricity networks total                                    | 59%                      | 786.0               | 693.9               |\n| SSE Renewables                                                | 22%                      | 294.3               | 342.7               |\n| Thermal Generation                                            | 8%                       | 106.5               | 177.0               |\n| Gas Storage                                                   | -                        | 1.9                 | 0.2                 |\n| Thermal Energy Total                                          | 8%                       | 108.4               | 177.2               |\n| Customer Solutions                                            | 2%                       | 31.2                | 0.3                 |\n| Energy Portfolio Management                                   | -                        | 2.1                 | -                   |\n| Enterprise                                                    | 5%                       | 66.0                | 57.4                |\n| Corporate Unallocated                                         | 2%                       | 25.8                | 85.9                |\n| Gas Production                                                | 2%                       | 26.8                | -                   |\n| Adjusted investment and capital expenditure,   before refunds | 100%                     | 1,340.6             | 1,357.5             |\n| Project finance development expenditure refunds               |                          | (428.6)             | -                   |\n| Adjusted investment and capital expenditure                   |                          | 912.0               | 1,357.5             |\n\n## Progress of capital expenditure programme\n\nDuring the year to 31 March 2021, SSE's investment and capital expenditure (before project finance development expenditure refunds) totalled \u00a31,340.6m, including \u00a31,080.3m of investment in SSE's core renewable energy and regulated networks businesses both of which are fundamental to delivery of net zero.\n\nTotal investment and capital expenditure in the year included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Further significant investment in electricity networks totalling \u00a3786.0m, or 59% of SSE's total investment and capital expenditure:\n- -SSEN Transmission continued to make excellent progress on its capital investment programme, despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Significant projects completed in the year including completion of several load related schemes to upgrade the network, as well as the replacement of the Inveraray to Crossaig transmission line in Argyll. Good progress also continues to be made on the Shetland HVDC link, which remains on track for energisation in 2024.\n- -SSEN Distribution continued its major capital investment programme across both of its networks, delivering significant improvements for customers and increasing the Regulated Asset Value (RAV). The business successfully completed\n- major upgrades to its network including a refurbishment programme of equipment spanning 58km of overhead network in Wiltshire and Hampshire.\n- \u00b7 The construction of SSE's flagship renewable energy projects continues to progress at pace, with investment during the period totalling \u00a3294.3m across a number of projects including:\n- - Onshore construction of Phases A and B of Dogger Bank, the world's largest offshore wind farm;\n- - Construction of the onshore substation and installation of the onshore cable for Seagreen, Scotland's largest wind farm and the world's deepest tethered project;\n- - Commencing construction on Viking, which will be among the highestyielding onshore wind farms in Europe; and\n- - Other onshore projects such as Lenalea in Ireland and Gordonbush extension.\n- \u00b7 SSE's flexible thermal fleet has continued to demonstrate its value in the transition to a renewables-led, net zero energy system and investment in thermal generation amounted to \u00a3106.5m, covering Keadby 2, which is on track to be fully commissioned in 2022, and Slough Multifuel projects.",

        "page_content": "## SSE'S hedging position at 31 March 2021\n\nSSE has an established approach to hedging through which it generally seeks to reduce its broad exposure to commodity price variation in relation to electricity generation and supply at least 12 months in advance of delivery. As market conditions change, SSE may require to vary its hedging approach to take account of any resultant new or additional exposures. SSE will continue to provide a summary of its current hedging approach, including details of any changes in the period, within its Interim and Full-year Results Statements.\n\nA summary of the hedging approach for each of SSE's market-based businesses at 31 March 2021 is set out in the table on the right.\n\nSSE's established approach to hedging seeks to account for the effect of the 'wind capture price' by targeting a hedge of less than 100% of its anticipated wind energy output for the coming 12 months. Historically this target was set at 85%. Following an assessment of the latest market conditions and wind capture percentages for the relevant wind assets the targeted hedge percentage will now be least 90% across the year and will be adjusted as necessary going forward to reflect the changes in future market and wind capture information.\n\nTo date, target hedge levels have been achieved solely through the forward sale of electricity. Future target hedge levels will be achieved through the forward sale of either electricity, or gas and carbon equivalent (if converted to electricity). This approach aims to reduce the exposure of these wind assets to volatile spot power market outcomes whilst still providing a hedge for the vast majority of the anticipated energy and carbon commodity price exposure 12 months in advance of delivery. This updated approach will be introduced for incremental volumes as they naturally come into the hedging window, i.e. historic hedge positions will not be unwound.\n\nThe approach to hedging hydro energy output remains unchanged at approximately 85% of its anticipated energy output for the coming 12 months.\n\n## SSE Renewables - GB wind and hydro hedging position\n\nSince March 2019, as part of its Full-year and Interim Results, SSE has reported the hedge position in relation to its GB Wind and Hydro generation. The following table provides an update at 31 March 2021.\n\n|       |                       | 2018/19   | 2019/20   | 2020/21   | 2021/22   | 2022/23   | 2023/24   |\n|-------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wind  | Expected volume - TWh | 4.5       | 4.5       | 4.5       | 4.2       | 5.3       | 6.8       |\n|       | Volume hedged - %     | 100%      | 100%      | 100%      | 85%       | 60%       | 19%       |\n|       | Hedge price - \u00a3MWh    | \u00a339       | \u00a339       | \u00a346       | \u00a348       | \u00a349       | \u00a347       |\n| Hydro | Expected volume - TWh | 3.4       | 3.5       | 3.4       | 3.6       | 3.6       | 3.7       |\n|       | Volume hedged - %     | 100%      | 100%      | 100%      | 83%       | 56%       | 17%       |\n|       | Hedge price - \u00a3/MWh   | \u00a339       | \u00a343       | \u00a348       | \u00a350       | \u00a349       | \u00a348       |\n\nFor comparison purposes, for years up to and including 2020/21, volumes are based on average expected output, and the contracted hedge price is at the beginning of each financial year. The table excludes additional volumes and income for BM activity, ROCs, ancillary services, pre-commissioning, capacity mechanism and shape variations. It also excludes volumes and income relating to Irish wind output, pumped storage and CfDs.\n\nUK Business Energy: The business supplies electricity and gas to business and public sector customers. Sales to contract customers are 100% hedged: at point of sale for fixed contract customers; upon instruction for flexi contract customers; and on a rolling hedge for tariff customers.\n\nBusiness Energy's sales demand volumes have been impacted by the economic uncertainty created by the coronavirus lockdown. The extent to which this will impact customers' consumption in the medium term remains uncertain. To reflect this Business Energy has adopted a more dynamic forecasting approach with an adjustment to hedging volumes as nearer term economic and consumption signals become clearer.\n\nGB Thermal: In the six months prior to delivery, SSE aims to hedge all of the expected output of its CCGT assets, having progressively established this hedge over the preceding 24 months. Hedging activity depends on the availability of sufficient market depth and liquidity, which can be limited, particularly for periods further into the future. As stated in its Q3 Trading Update on 2 February 2021, due to the uncertainty surrounding UK carbon pricing, SSE temporarily suspended forward hedging of the expected generation profiles of its CCGTs in GB. SSE will continue to monitor market developments, in particular developments surrounding UK carbon pricing, and will adjust its hedging approach to take account of any resultant change in exposures.\n\nGas Storage: The annual auction to offer gas storage capacity contracts from Atwick, held in April 2021, resulted in no third-party contracts being secured. As such the assets are being commercially operated and the business continues to manage its exposure to changes in the spread between summer and winter prices, market volatility and plant availability.\n\nGas Production: As the E&P business remains held for sale on an unhedged basis, no forward hedge activity is currently being undertaken for the likely production profiles of the business.\n\nEnergy Portfolio Management (EPM): EPM provides the route to market and manages the execution for all of SSE's commodity trading outlined above (spark spread, power, gas, and carbon). This includes managing market conditions and liquidity and reporting and monitoring net Group exposures. The business operates under strict position limits and VAR controls. There is some scope for small positiontaking to permit EPM to manage around liquidity and shape but this is contained within a VAR limit of \u00a32m.\n\nIreland: Vertical integration of the generation and customer businesses in Ireland limits the Group's commodity exposure in that market.",

In addition to the exceptional fair value uplifts on loss of control noted above were developer profits on disposal of stakes in Dogger Bank offshore windfarm development (\u00a3202.8), Seagreen offshore windfarm development (\u00a323.3m) and Slough Multifuel (\u00a320.4m).\n\nAs part of the Group's strategy to secure value from disposals of non-core assets, the Group recorded a net exceptional gain of \u00a3877.8m in the year from completed disposals and recognition of impairment charges on businesses classified as held for sale. The final exceptional result on sale of the Gas Production assets and the Contracting and Rail business will be recognised following completion during the 2021/22 financial year.\n\nFor a full description of exceptional items, see Note 7 of the Financial Statements.\n\n## Operating derivatives\n\nSSE enters into forward purchase contracts (for power, gas and other commodities) to meet the future demands of its energy supply businesses and to optimise the value of its generation assets. Some of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 and as such require to be recorded at their fair value as at the date of the financial statements.\n\nSSE shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement does not reflect the realised operating performance of the businesses. The underlying value of these contracts is recognised as the relevant commodity is delivered, which for the large majority of the position at 31 March 2021 is expected to be within the next 12-18 months.\n\nThe balance sheet movement in the operating derivative mark-to-market valuation was a \u00a3590.1m increase from a net 'out-of-the-money' position into a net 'in-the-money' position. This movement consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Settlement during the year of \u00a3161.0m of previously 'out-of-the-money' contracts in line with the contracted delivery periods; and\n- \u00b7 Mark-to-market gains of \u00a3429.1m on unsettled contracts entered into during the course of 2019/20 and 2020/21 in line with the Group's stated hedging policy. These mark-to-market gains reflect the volatility in commodity markets during the year due to coronavirus and weather conditions impacting gas prices in particular.\n\n## Commodity stocks held at fair value\n\nGas inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is held at fair value with reference to the forward month market price. The \u00a38.5m positive movement in the year arose from increases in both the volume and the fair value of gas held over historic cost at the year end.\n\n## Financing derivatives\n\nIn addition to the positive movements above, a positive movement of \u00a355.6m was recognised on financing derivatives in the year to 31 March 2021, including SSE's share of joint venture financing derivative remeasurements. These gains are predominately due to higher interest rates on cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, offset by the impact of stronger Sterling against the Dollar and Euro on cross currency swaps linked to Eurobonds, Hybrids and US private placement debt.\n\nThese remeasurements are presented separately as they do not represent underlying business performance in the period. The result on financing derivatives will be recognised in adjusted profit before tax when the derivatives are settled.",

outflow and securing value and proceeds from disposals is its target of a net debt/EBITDA ratio at the lower end of a range of 4.5 - 5 times across the four years to 31 March 2025.\n\nAs well as promoting the long-term success of the Company, this approach is also designed to ensure that SSE maintains credit rating ratios (Retained Cash Flow (RCF)/Net Debt and Funds From Operations (FFO)/Net Debt) that are comparable with private sector utilities across Europe and comfortably above those required for an investment grade credit rating.\n\nSSE's S&P credit rating remains at BBB+ 'stable outlook' and its Moody's rating remains at Baa1, albeit on negative outlook, following review in September 2020.\n\n## Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital\n\nSSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital was \u00a38.9bn at 31 March 2021, down from \u00a310.5bn at 31 March 2020, reflecting the ongoing disposal programme and debt revaluation adjustments partially offset by the ongoing capital investment programme and working capital movements including the impact from coronavirus.\n\nThe Group accessed the debt and hybrid capital markets three times during the year issuing c.\u00a32.5bn of debt over six tranches.\n\n## Debt summary as at 31 March 2021\n\nIn April 2020 SSE plc issued a \u20ac1.1bn (\u00a3970m) 5-year and 10-year dual tranche Eurobond with \u20ac600m (\u00a3531m) maturing in 2025 and \u20ac500m (\u00a3443m) maturing in 2030 with coupons of 1.25% and 1.75% respectively. Both tranches were swapped back to fixed Sterling resulting in an allin funding cost of 2.43% for the 5-year tranche and 2.89% for the 10-year tranche.\n\nIn March 2021, SSEN Transmission issued a new \u00a3500m dual tranche green bond, in the form of a 7-year bond with a coupon of 1.50% and a 15-year bond with a coupon of 2.125%.",

The hedges ensure that any movement in the value of net debt is predominately offset by a movement in the derivative position. The debt revaluation decrease at March 2021 was primarily driven by stronger Sterling against the Euro and Dollar.\n\nIn addition to the hybrid bond called in April 2021 as outlined below, \u00a3450m of debt will mature in September 2021 with a further \u00a3415m maturing in February 2022.\n\n## Hybrid bonds summary as at 31 March 2021\n\nHybrid bonds are a valuable part of SSE's capital structure, helping to diversify SSE's investor base and most importantly to support credit rating ratios, with their 50% equity treatment by the rating agencies being positive for SSE's credit metrics.\n\nIn July 2020, SSE issued a dual tranche equity accounted hybrid bond intended to replace the hybrids issued in 2015 (at an all-in rate of 4.02%), which have issuer first call dates of 10 September 2020 (\u00a3750m) and 1 April 2021 (\u20ac600m).

The remaining March 2017 hybrid bonds have a fixed redemption date and are therefore debt accounted and included within Loans and Other Borrowings; as such they are already part of SSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital.\n\nThe coupon payments relating to the equity accounted hybrid bonds are presented as distributions to other equity holders and are reflected within adjusted earnings per share when paid. The coupon payments on the debt accounted hybrid bonds are treated as finance costs under IFRS 9.\n\nIn accordance with the first call date noted above, the \u20ac600m (\u00a3440m) March 2015 Hybrid Bond was called and redeemed in April 2021.\n\n## Managing net finance costs\n\nSSE's adjusted net finance costs - including interest on debt accounted hybrid bonds but not equity accounted hybrid bonds were \u00a3441.6m in the year to 31 March 2021, compared to \u00a3465.0m in the previous year reflecting the full year impact of interest on the \u00a3100m loan note issued as part of the SSE Energy Services disposal in January 2020.\n\n3.74%; and a perpetual non-call 7.0-year note at \u20ac500m with a coupon of 3.125%. The \u20ac500m tranche has been partly swapped back to Sterling, resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of just under 3.8% per annum.\n\nA summary of SSE's Hybrid Bonds as at 31 March 2021 can be found below:",

        "page_content": "Reported net finance costs were \u00a3227.1m compared to \u00a3375.8m, reflecting a \u00a3138.6m year-on-year change in the mark-to-market revaluation of financing derivatives held at fair value.\n\n## Summarising cash and cash equivalents\n\nAt 31 March 2021, SSE's adjusted net debt included cash and cash equivalents of \u00a31.6bn, up from \u00a30.2bn at March 2020 reflecting proceeds from disposals received prior to 31 March 2021 and the issuance of the \u00a3500m dual tranche green bond in March 2021. This strong cash position\n\nwill allow SSE to meet its near term debt repayment and capital investment needs as set out above.\n\nAs the fair value of forward commodity contracts has moved from an 'out of the money' position in the prior year to an 'in the money' position in the current year, the related collateral required has similarly unwound. At 31 March 2021, \u00a337.1m of cash was held as collateral from third parties on these 'in the money' contracts, compared to \u00a3256.4m of cash provided as collateral to third parties in the prior year.\n\n## Revolving credit facility\n\nSSE has \u00a31.5bn of committed bank facilities in place to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity to allow day-to-day operations and investment programmes to continue in the event of disruption to Capital Markets preventing SSE from issuing new debt for a period of time. These facilities, noting any options to extend, are set out in the table below.\n\n| Date   | Issuer   | Debt type                                                       | Term                            | Value   |\n|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Mar 19 | SSE plc  | Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with 10 Relationship Banks | 2026                            | \u00a31.3bn  |\n| Oct 19 | SSE plc  | Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of China                    | 2025 (option to extend to 2026) | \u00a3200m   |\n\nThe facilities can also be utilised to cover short-term funding requirements; however, they remain undrawn for most of the time and at 31 March 2021 they were both undrawn.\n\nBoth facilities are classified as sustainable facilities with interest rate and fees paid dependant on SSE's performance in environmental, social and governance matters, as assessed independently by Vigeo Eiris.\n\n## Maintaining a prudent treasury policy\n\nSSE's treasury policy is designed to be prudent and flexible. In line with that, cash from operations is first used to finance regulatory and maintenance capital expenditure and then dividend payments, with investment and capital expenditure for growth generally financed by a combination of cash from operations, bank borrowings and bond issuance. In 2020/21 growth was also financed by disposal proceeds.\n\nAs a matter of policy, a minimum of 50% of SSE's debt is subject to fixed rates of interest. Within this policy framework, SSE borrows as required on different interest bases, with financial instruments being used to achieve the desired out-turn interest rate profile. At 31 March 2021, 98% of SSE's borrowings were at fixed rates.\n\nBorrowings are mainly in Sterling and Euros to reflect the underlying currency denomination of assets and cash flows within SSE. All other foreign currency borrowings are swapped back into either Sterling or Euros.\n\nTransactional foreign exchange risk arises in respect of procurement contracts, fuel and carbon purchasing, commodity hedging and energy portfolio management operations, and long-term service agreements for plant.\n\nSSE's policy is to hedge any material transactional foreign exchange risks through the use of forward currency purchases and/or financial instruments. Translational foreign exchange risk arises in respect of overseas investments; hedging in respect of such exposures is determined as appropriate to the circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Ensuring a strong debt structure through medium- and long-term borrowings\n\nThe ability to raise funds at competitive rates is fundamental to investment. SSE's fundraising over the past five years, including senior bonds, hybrid capital and term loans, now totals \u00a37.7bn (including over \u00a32.5bn of debt and hybrid capital raised in the financial year to 31 March 2021) and SSE's objective is to maintain a reasonable range of debt maturities. Its average debt maturity, excluding hybrid securities, at 31 March 2021 was 7.4 years, up from 6.5 years at 31 March 2020. This reflects SSE's recent debt issuance which has replaced maturing debt. SSE's average cost of debt is now 3.75%, compared to 3.51% at 31 March 2020.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors regularly review the Group's funding structure and have assessed that the Financial Statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn making their assessment the Directors have considered sensitivities on the forecast future cashflows of the Group for the period to 31 December 2022 resulting from the coronavirus pandemic; the Group's credit rating; the success of the Group's disposal programme through 2020/21; and the successful issuance of \u00a32.5bn of medium to long term debt and hybrid equity during the year. In line with expectations in June, the impact from coronavirus on SSE is mitigated by its robust business model and the nature and quality of its asset base. As such, there has been minimal adverse impact on the financial performance of the Group's transmission, renewables and thermal businesses, with the coronavirus impact limited to the Group's other businesses.\n\nThe Directors have also assessed that the Group remains able to access Capital Markets, despite a period of disruption due to coronavirus, as demonstrated by the \u00a32.5bn of debt issued over the last 12 months via the dual tranche Euro bond issuance in April 2020, the dual tranche hybrid issuance in July 2020 and the dual tranche green bond issuance in March 2021. There is also an expectation of future available liquidity in the commercial paper market in addition to the Group's existing liquidity with \u00a31.5bn of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.",

Slough Multifuel Ltd has been included for the first time at 31 March 2021, due to loss of control following divestment of a 50% stake on 2 April 2020. Seagreen Windfarm Ltd has been included for the first time at 31 March 2021, due to loss of control following divestment of a 51% stake on 3 June 2020.\n\n## Taxation\n\nSSE is one of the UK's biggest taxpayers, and in the PwC survey published in December 2020 was ranked 16th out of the 100 Group of Companies in 2020 in terms of taxes borne (those which represent a cost to the company, and which are reflected in its financial results).\n\nSSE considers being a responsible taxpayer a core element of its social contract with the societies in which it operates. SSE seeks to pay the right amount of tax on its profits, in the right place, at the right time, and was the first FTSE 100 company to be awarded the Fair Tax Mark. While SSE has an obligation to its shareholders, customers and other stakeholders to efficiently manage its total tax liability, it does not seek to use the tax system in a way it does not consider it was meant to operate, or use 'tax havens' to reduce its tax liabilities.\n\nSSE understands it has a social contract. This means it has an obligation to the society in which it operates, and from which it benefits - for example, tax receipts are vital for the public services SSE relies upon. Therefore, SSE's tax policy is to operate within both the letter and spirit of the law at all times.\n\nIn November 2020, SSE published 'Talking Tax 2020: Proud to pay our part'. It did this because it believes building trust with stakeholders on issues relating to tax is important to the long-term sustainability of the business.\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2021, SSE paid \u00a3379.0m of taxes on profits, property taxes, environmental taxes, and employment taxes in the UK, compared with \u00a3421.6m in the previous year. The reduction in total taxes paid in 2020/21 compared with the previous year was primarily due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Fewer corporation tax payments made in the current year, as the UK Government changed the phasing of quarterly tax payments in the previous year;\n- \u00b7 Lower Climate Change Levy being paid as a result of lower levels of carbon emissions; and\n- \u00b7 Lower employment tax being paid as a result of the sale of the Energy Services Group to OVO in January 2020, and corresponding reduction in headcount.\n\nIn 2020/21 SSE also paid \u20ac20.4m of taxes in Ireland, compared to \u20ac18.1m the previous year. Ireland is the only country outside the UK in which it has any trading operations.\n\nAs with other key financial indicators, SSE's focus is on adjusted profit before tax and, in line with that, SSE believes that the adjusted current tax charge on that profit is the tax measure that best reflects underlying performance. SSE's adjusted current tax rate, based on adjusted profit before tax, was 10.1%, compared with 11.2% in 2019/20 on the same basis. The reduction in adjusted current tax rate year-on-year was primarily as a result of an increase in the level of non-taxable developer profits made on the sale of shares.",

At 30 September 2020, there was a large decline in the valuation of the Southern Electric Pension Scheme ('SEPS') due to market volatility and changing\n\nfinancial assumptions associated with coronavirus. By 31 March 2021 the scheme had recovered from the market volatility, reducing the net deficit on SEPS by \u00a315.0m compared to prior year.\n\nThe Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme ('SHEPS') has insured against volatility in its deferred and pensioner\n\nmembers through the purchase of 'buy-in' contracts meaning that the Group only retains exposure to volatility in active employees. During the year the SHEPS surplus increased by \u00a38.9m.\n\nAdditional information on employee pension schemes can be found in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.",

As a result of its continued strong operational performance during 2020/21, SSEN Transmission will receive the full reward of \u00a31.2m through the Energy Not Supplied (ENS) Incentive for 2020/21, which will be reflected in revenue in 2022/23.\n\nThe RIIO-T1 period has also seen significant growth in the volume of renewables connected to SSEN Transmission's network, which has more than doubled, from 3.3GW to 6.7GW. This includes growth of 277MW in 2020/21, bringing the total installed generation capacity in the north of Scotland to over 8GW.\n\nThis growth has been underpinned by successful delivery of major reinforcements, on time and within allowances. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, SSEN Transmission made - and continues to make - excellent progress on its capital investment programme, with the continued delivery of several projects carrying over to RIIO-T2, as planned.\n\nThis includes reinforcements to upgrade the existing onshore transmission network on the East Coast to 400kV operation, as well as the replacement of the Inveraray to Crossaig transmission line in Argyll. The main construction works for the first phase, between Inveraray and Port Ann, is now complete, with these works a critical component of the wider 275kV Argyll strategy.\n\nGood progress also continues to be made on the Shetland HVDC link, which remains on track for energisation in 2024. The project is currently expected to entail around \u00a3650m of investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'SSEN Transmission has a critical role to play in a green-led recovery from coronavirus and we are helping the UK and Scottish governments meet their decarbonisation targets by getting on with the agreed elements of our RIIO-T2 business plan and delivering a network for net zero.'\n\nRob McDonald Managing Director, SSEN Transmission",

        "page_content": "## OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nIn May 2021, Ofgem published its consultation on the Eastern HVDC project Initial Needs Case, recognising the need and consumer benefit for the reinforcement. The project, which will see the first of two HVDC links planned from Peterhead to England, is required to alleviate current and future constraints on the transmission system and remains on track for energisation in 2029. A Final Needs Case for the link is expected to be submitted to Ofgem later this year.\n\n## RIIO-T2 investment programme the certain view\n\nIn December 2020, Ofgem published its Final Determinations for the RIIO-T2 period, which covers the period from April 2021 to March 2026. With totex set at \u00a32.2bn these reflected a significant increase in totex from Ofgem's Draft Determinations and, taken together with the island link to Shetland, which is already in construction, allow spend across the T2 period of around \u00a32.8bn. The business has chosen not to appeal the investment programme aspect of the Final Determination and is fully focused on delivering its 'Network for Net Zero' business plan.\n\nHowever, while the bulk of the price control settlement matched SSEN Transmission and its stakeholders' collective ambition, the financial parameters did not. Correspondingly, in March 2021, SSEN Transmission confirmed its intention to appeal certain elements of the settlement to the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nThe appeal is both technical and narrow in scope, focused on areas where Ofgem's decision does not reflect the robust evidence provided throughout the price control process, alongside material errors in the decision. The appeal areas are:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of equity.\n- \u00b7 Outperformance wedge.\n- \u00b7 New exposure to transmission charges.\n- \u00b7 Loss of appeals right.\n\nWhile SSEN Transmission fully understands the need to minimise customer bills, the appeal is the right thing to do, it is echoed by others in the sector and it does not undermine the broader constructive relationship the business has with Ofgem. A conclusion to the appeal is expected by November 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, by focusing on delivering the agreed elements of its business plan, SSEN Transmission is supporting UK Government's net zero targets and a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Taking the Certain View alone of around \u00a32.8bn totex, Transmission RAV would exceed \u00a35bn by the end of RIIO-T2.\n\n## RIIO-T2 - uncertainty mechanisms\n\nWith the North of Scotland home to some of the world's greatest resources of renewable energy, SSEN Transmission is uniquely placed to play a leading role in the transition to net zero and the significant growth opportunities this presents.\n\n## During the RIIO-T2 period, SSEN\n\nTransmission expects to progress a number of investments over and above its \u00a32.8bn Certain View. SSEN Transmission expects to unlock the additional investments required to put the North of Scotland on a pathway to net zero through Ofgem's Uncertainty Mechanisms. These investments include:\n\n- \u00b7 Development and early construction expenditure for the first East Coast HVDC link from Peterhead to the north east of England.\n- \u00b7 Upgrading the Argyll transmission network to 275kV operation, as well as the replacement of the Fort-Augustus to Skye transmission line. Initial Needs Cases for both projects are expected to be submitted to Ofgem this year.\n- \u00b7 Further expenditure to connect new renewable generation, rail electrification and system security.\n\n.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese investments could see the total installed generation capacity increase to around 14GW by the end of RIIO-T2, with almost 13GW of this from renewable sources. However, they represent an 'uncertain view' because final investment decisions remain subject to a range of factors, including generator commitment, necessary planning permissions, and, crucially, Ofgem's approval of 'Needs Cases' However, combined, these investments, alongside the Certain View, could bring the total expenditure across the RIIO-T2 period to over \u00a34bn, with Transmission RAV increasing to over \u00a36bn by the end of RIIO-T2.\n\n## Further growth opportunities\n\nIn addition to the opportunities outlined above, SSEN Transmission continues to work with stakeholders in Orkney and the Western Isles to develop and take forward proposals to enable mainland transmission connections.\n\nBeyond RIIO-T2, the ScotWind leasing round is expected to unlock up to 10GW of new renewable generation which will require significant transmission upgrades both onshore and offshore. This includes a second HVDC link from Peterhead to England, required to deliver 2030 offshore wind targets, supporting future earnings and RAV growth.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.",

Informed by an extensive stakeholder engagement programme, the plan will support a costeffective and secure path to net zero for customers and communities while representing a fair financial package for investors that recognises current and future demand and risk.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nKey to successful delivery against any regulatory price control is efficient and focused capital investment, upgrading and expanding the infrastructure critical to support the net zero transition. In 2020/21, SSEN Distribution continued its major capital investment programme across both of its networks, delivering significant improvements for customers and increasing Regulated Asset Value (RAV).\n\nOver \u00a3350m was invested in network infrastructure in the last year, bringing the total invested since the beginning of the price control to over \u00a31.9bn. This is part of a forecast investment of \u00a32.6bn throughout the RIIO-ED1 period, supporting future earnings and building RAV growth. This included a \u00a39.8m refurbishment programme spanning 58km of overhead lines in Wiltshire and Hampshire and a \u00a310m programme of investment in Aberdeen to upgrade the underground network and install automation capability.\n\nAs part of its 'flexibility first' approach to network investment, an additional 348MW of flexible energy service contracts were secured during 2020/21, enough to power approximately 91,000 homes. SSEN now has 446MW of contracted flexibility services across its networks, which will increasingly play a vital role in supporting the delivery of a smarter electricity grid and a cost-effective transition to net zero.\n\nUnder the RIIO regulatory regime, providing increasing reliability for customers remains a key revenue driver.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We are confident that our RIIO-ED2 business plan for the next price control period will provide the strategic investment required to achieve net zero while continuing to provide the safe, reliable and affordable service our customers and communities need.'\n\nChris Burchell Managing Director, SSEN Distribution",

        "page_content": "## OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nAs part of the Interruptions Inventive Scheme (IIS), SSEN is incentivised on its performance against the loss of electricity supply through the recording of Customer Interruptions (CI) and Customers Minutes Lost (CML), which include both planned and unplanned supply interruptions. These incentives will typically be collected two years after they are earned. Across both licence areas, overall IIS incentive earnings were \u00a37.6m in 2020/21, slightly down from the \u00a37.8m secured in 2019/20 and improving performance in this area is a key focus for the year ahead.\n\nIncentives can also be earned for performance against key customer service and stakeholder metrics. In 2020/21, SSEN Distribution secured a Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction (BMCS) incentive reward of \u00a34.9m. This is down from \u00a35.6m last year, reflecting the challenges during the coronavirus lockdown and recovery, particularly in the busier SEPD licence area which are being addressed through a targeted improvement programme. In the SHEPD area, performance remained strong with an overall BMCS ranking of third out of 14 DNO licensees.\n\nDue to the impact of coronavirus restrictions, reward from core connections incentives, which include the time to connect customers, fell to \u00a32m in 2020/21 from \u00a32.7m last year. An increased \u00a31.1m reward was secured from the Stakeholder Engagement and Consumer Vulnerability incentive, representing SSEN's best return since 2016/17.\n\nIt should be noted that whilst Distribution Use of System (DUoS) revenue declined in 2020/21, primarily due to the impact of coronavirus, an overall under-recovery of \u00a328m against Allowed Revenue in 2020/21 will be built into tariffs for collection in FY 2022/23.\n\n## Growth Opportunities\n\nAchieving the UK's net zero ambitions will require extensive electrification of heat and transport and it is crucial that the local electricity distribution networks act as an enabler not a constraint to this significant change. SSEN Distribution strongly supports a mechanism for strategic investment in flexible solutions or network reinforcement to enable a cost-effective transition to net zero for the households, businesses and communities it serves.\n\nIn support of this aim and the Government's green recovery ambitions, SSEN partnered with Ofgem and other DNO licensees to develop a targeted Green Recovery investment programme. Following a sixweek stakeholder consultation to identify 'shovel-ready' low-carbon projects that could be unlocked by early investment in the network, 12 network schemes were approved by Ofgem representing \u00a341m of additional investment during the current price control period. This expenditure will be incurred outside of the totex investment mechanism, delivering additional value for shareholders.\n\n## Investment in Scotia Gas Networks (SGN)\n\n## SGN key performance indicators\n\n|                                    | March   2021   | March   2020   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Scotia Gas Networks (SGN)          |                |                |\n| SSE's 33.3% share                  |                |                |\n| SGN adjusted operating profit - \u00a3m | 173.0          | 202.3          |\n| SGN reported operating profit - \u00a3m | 88.6           | 80.8           |\n| Regulated Asset Value - \u00a3m         | 1,949          | 1,952          |\n\n## Overview of SSE's investment in SGN\n\nSSE holds a 33% financial investment stake in SGN, the gas distribution company which serves 5.9 million homes and businesses across the south of England, all of Scotland, and the western region of Northern Ireland. SGN has been a good financial investment but it is part a \u00a32bn disposals programme that is sharpening SSE's focus on its core, low-carbon electricity businesses. SSE expects to commence a formal sale process for SGN in mid-summer 2021, with the intention of having an agreed sale by the end of the calendar year.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2021 98.9% of uncontrolled gas escapes were attended in under an hour. In the same period SGN delivered 11,034 new gas connections, including 1,263 assisted connections as part of efforts to help those in fuel poverty.\n\nWith its focus on innovation, decarbonisation and engineering excellence, SGN's RIIOGD2 price control business plan commits the business to making a positive impact on society, delivering a safe and efficient service and contributing to net zero goals by accelerating decarbonised gas solutions.\n\nTo understand the growth potential of electrification for SSEN's distribution networks, updated Distribution Future Energy Scenario reports were published in December 2020. The upper range of the net zero scenarios forecast the number of electric vehicles in SSEN Distribution licence areas to increase from 30,000 in 2020 to 5 million in 2050, with heat pumps rising from 32,000 to 2.5m and local renewable capacity from 5GW to 18GW.\n\nThis analysis is one of the factors informing SSEN's RIIO-ED2 business plan which will be published in draft form in early July, with the final plan submitted to Ofgem in December. Co-created with stakeholders and customers, the ambitious plan will deliver targeted investment in network resilience to build a foundation for an electrified future, improvements to the valued service for customers and communities and further development of the smart, flexible, local energy networks to accelerate progress to net zero. While it is too early for specific projections, an increase in investment on ED1 rates is needed to meet customer needs and keep pace with net zero policy and targets.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.\n\nSGN has also appealed the financial parameters of the settlement to Ofgem but has accepted the totex settlement. As with SSEN Transmission, it too expects to use the re-opener process with Ofgem for further net zero aligned investment outside of the price control.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.",

Its operational offshore wind installed capacity is 487MW with its onshore wind and hydro-electric installed capacity at 1,936MW and 1,159MW respectively.\n\nWhilst SSE Renewables' output in 2020/21 was down around 10% compared to 2019/20 due to the sale of Walney and poor weather conditions across both wind and hydro, its fleet proved to be extremely resilient through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn terms of operational maintenance and plant performance, it was a strong year with overall availability high across onshore and offshore wind and hydro operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The work we are doing in developing, constructing and operating world-class renewable electricity assets is powering change in the UK and Irish economies. We are currently building more offshore wind than anyone else, and developments in the market this year have shown just how valuable our pipeline is.'\n\nJim Smith Managing Director, SSE Renewables",

        "page_content": "## OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nOffshore, major works were completed to schedule and without incident at Greater Gabbard offshore wind farm (504MW, SSE Renewables share 50%), which SSE Renewables operates on behalf of its joint venture partner, RWE.\n\nOnshore, first power was achieved at SSE Renewables' first fully merchant wind farm, Gordonbush Extension (38MW). In March, the project secured a 15-year Capacity Market Agreement in the T-4 auction for the delivery year 2024/25 (3MW de-rated at an auction clearing price of \u00a318/kW).\n\nMaintenance of more onshore sites were brought in-house in the second half of the 2020/21 financial year, bringing the total to 63% of SSE Renewables' wholly-owned onshore wind assets (excluding joint venture sites). New operational technology in its dedicated wind operations centre is now commissioned and will enable future efficiency improvements from an already strong industry position.\n\nThe optimisation of SSE Renewables' hydro operations continues to yield positive results in terms of output and value. Through adjusted running regimes, focused performance metrics, and digitalisation efforts, enhanced performance of the hydro fleet will play an important role in providing low-carbon flexibility required for the net zero transition, while continuing to meet environmental obligations. The 300MW pumped storage assets at Foyers returned from a planned outage in the second half of the year and have achieved exceptional performance via the utilisation of their vital flexibility to the GB electricity system and focused commercial management of the assets.\n\nHydro continued to illustrate the benefit it brings to the SSE Renewables portfolio from its flexible capabilities and range of service provision by successfully securing additional contracts across multiple markets, including further flexible constraint managed zone (CMZ) agreements and positive results within the recent T-1 Capacity Market auction where two units at Lochay hydro station 42.709MW (de-rated) and two units at Tummel hydro station (de-rated) secured agreements at an auction clearing price of \u00a345/kW.\n\nSSE Renewables continues to make progress with its programme of capital investment focusing on extending the life of large flexible hydro assets and improving reliability and efficiency. The last\n\nstage of the works associated with SSER's investment in Grudie Bridge (18.7MW) is forecast to be complete this year as planned. Progress has also been made with additional investment in Fasnakyle (69MW) and Rannoch (44MW). A final investment decision has been reached on the replant of Tummel Bridge (34MW), which is on track to commence works later this year.\n\n## Growth opportunities construction programme\n\nSSE Renewables is currently leading construction of more offshore wind capacity than any other company globally.\n\nThe first two phases of the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, Dogger Bank A and B (each 1,200MW, SSE Renewables share 40%), reached financial close in November 2020. In February SSE Renewables closed the agreement to sell a 10% interest in Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B to Eni, securing significant additional value in the process (\u00a3206.3m) and underlining its ability to realise value and recycle capital for future development projects. Following the transaction Dogger Bank is jointly owned by SSE (40%) and partners Equinor (40%) and Eni (20%). Onshore construction on phases A and B continue to progress well. SSE Renewables expects to start offshore construction on A in a year's time, aiming for first power in summer 2023 and full power in spring 2024. Dogger Bank B is planned to effectively run a year behind. Dogger Bank C aims to reach financial close and progress a stake sale later this calendar year.\n\nThe Dogger Bank projects will cumulatively contribute around 18TWh of additional renewable output to the UK electricity system annually. They will create hundreds of direct jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, and SSE was delighted that, on the strength of orders from Dogger Bank and with its support and efforts, GE was able to commit to investing in a new blade manufacturing facility in Teesside.\n\nSeagreen 1 (1,075MW, SSE Renewables share 49%), located in Scottish waters, is a joint venture with Total and reached a final investment decision in June 2020. When complete, it will be Scotland's largest wind farm and the world's deepest tethered project. Construction of the onshore substation and installation of the onshore cable are progressing well. Offshore construction is due to begin in Autumn 2021 with the installation of turbine foundations expected this year and full power targeted at the end of 2022.\n\nWith 621MW not currently attached to a CfD, there is the potential to compete in the next auction for the uncontracted part of the project.\n\nViking, at 443MW with a load factor of 48%, will be among the highest-yielding onshore wind farms in Europe, producing almost 2TWh annually. Construction is progressing well with work on the DC substation starting this summer, turbines in early 2023 and completion planned for autumn 2024. The wind farm will also have the option to enter CfD Allocation Round 4 later this year.\n\nIn Ireland, Lenalea wind farm (30MW, SSE Renewables share 50%) has entered into construction following success in the first RESS auction, which cleared at a weighted average price of \u20ac74/MWh.\n\n## Growth opportunities - pipeline\n\nBeyond these flagship projects SSE has a healthy pipeline and delivering it will see, on average, over 500MW of renewables capacity added each year to 2030. SSE Renewables has a clear aspiration to reach a run rate of at least 1GW of new assets a year during the second half of this decade and now expects to exceed its target for trebling its renewable output by 2030.\n\nNear-term growth opportunities will come from SSE Renewables' consented offshore sites: Seagreen 1A (360MW, SSE Renewables share 49%), which is an extension to the Seagreen 1 site, and Arklow Bank Wind Park (520MW) in Ireland. Design and development work on Seagreen 1A is ongoing, the outputs of which will inform the JV decision whether to bid it into AR4 and, with a first Irish offshore auction to be scheduled in 2022, the Arklow Bank project will be well placed to take part.\n\nIf successful, both projects could be operational by 2025/26. SSE Renewables is also focused on achieving consents for its planned projects at Berwick Bank and Marr Bank offshore wind farms (up to 4,150MW) located off the Firth of Forth. Following further refinements to the projects, planning applications should be submitted by Spring 2022 with the aim of securing consent by 2024.\n\nNorth Falls offshore wind farm (up to 504MW, SSE Renewables share 50%), which is an extension to the Greater Gabbard wind farm off the east coast of England, continues to progress at a similar pace to Berwick Bank and could also be operational by 2030.",

        "page_content": "Whilst SSE Renewables did not secure any new seabed in the Crown Estate Round 4 leasing process, the auction outcome demonstrated the huge value of SSE Renewables' existing pipeline. There will be opportunities to secure further seabed via Crown Estate Scotland's ScotWind leasing process. Following review by the Scottish Government, the process will maintain a capped option fee structure, albeit at a higher level than the previous cap, which should help to ensure the projects remain competitive versus those in England. The process will be completed towards the end of 2021.\n\nSSE Renewables has stated its ambition to contribute a significant amount of the capacity needed to meeting Ireland's 5GW offshore wind target by 2030. A foreshore licence has been secured for site investigations for the 800MW Braymore Point project off the north-east coast and an application has been submitted for the 800MW Celtic Sea array off the southeast coast.\n\nFuture onshore growth can be delivered through SSE Renewables' consented sites at Strathy South (208MW) and Tangy repower (57MW) in Scotland and Yellow River (105MW) in Ireland. Four new additional onshore wind opportunities in Scotland, totalling 245MW, have been identified and for which preliminary environmental and engineering studies have commenced. That takes the total unconsented GB and Ireland onshore wind pipeline (SSE share) to over 700MW.\n\nSSE Renewables continues to see an important role for its Coire Glas pumped hydro storage project (up to 1,500MW) in providing critical flexibility to balance increasing volumes of variable renewables. Coire Glas would more than double existing pumped hydro capacity potentially powering 3m homes for up to 24 hours - and is the most proven long duration storage solution which could be built by 2030. Further clarity on the policy framework and route to market for such projects is expected from BEIS and Ofgem later this year.\n\n## SSE Renewables project pipeline\n\n| Project                    | Location   | Technology            | Capacity   (MW)   | SSE Share   (MW)   |\n|----------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Due FID or in Construction |            |                       |                   |                    |\n| Dogger Bank A              | GB         | Offshore wind         | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Dogger Bank B              | GB         | Offshore wind         | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Dogger Bank C              | GB         | Offshore wind         | 1,200             | 600                |\n| Seagreen 1                 | GB         | Offshore wind         | 1,075             | 527                |\n| Viking                     | GB         | Onshore wind          | 443               | 443                |\n| Gordonbush extension       | GB         | Onshore wind          | 38                | 38                 |\n| Lenalea                    | ROI        | Onshore wind          | 31                | 16                 |\n| Consented                  |            |                       |                   |                    |\n| Arklow Bank 2 1            | ROI        | Offshore wind         | 520               | 520                |\n| Seagreen 1A                | GB         | Offshore wind         | 360               | 176                |\n| Yellow River               | ROI        | Onshore wind          | 105               | 105                |\n| Tangy                      | GB         | Onshore wind          | 57                | 57                 |\n| Requiring consent          |            |                       |                   |                    |\n| Berwick Bank               | GB         | Offshore wind         | Up to 2,300       | Up to 2,300        |\n| Marr Bank                  | GB         | Offshore wind         | Up to 1,850       | Up to 1,850        |\n| North Falls                | GB         | Offshore wind         | 504               | 252                |\n| Strathy South              | GB         | Onshore wind          | 208               | 208                |\n| Cloiche                    | GB         | Onshore wind          | 155               | 155                |\n| Other                      | -          | Onshore wind          | c200              | c200               |\n| Future prospects           |            |                       |                   |                    |\n| Braymore Point             | ROI        | Offshore wind         | 800               | 800                |\n| Celtic Sea Array           | ROI        | Offshore wind         | 800               | 800                |\n| Scotwind                   | GB         | Offshore wind         | -                 | -                  |\n| Thor                       |            | Denmark Offshore wind | 800-1,000         | 800-1,000          |\n| Other GB                   | GB         | Onshore wind          | c250              | c250               |\n| Other NI                   | NI         | Onshore wind          | c50               | c50                |\n| Other ROI                  | ROI        | Onshore wind          | c250              | c250               |\n| Coire Glas 2               | GB         | Pumped storage        | Up to 1,500       | Up to 1,500        |\n\n## Growth opportunities international\n\nSSE Renewables will retain a UK and Irish core but has made progress in diversifying its pipeline overseas. With countries around the world committing to more ambitious renewables targets, the addressable market is increasing in size. SSE Renewables is primarily interested in offshore and onshore wind, with a focus on growth markets and local partnerships where it can add value.\n\nIn Europe, SSE Renewables is now involved in a consortium participating in the tender process for the 800-1000MW Thor offshore wind site in Denmark, which will conclude later in 2021. Whilst expected to be highly competitive, SSE is partnering well with Copenhagen Infrastructure partners and local energy company Andel Holding.\n\nA partnership agreement was struck with Madrid-based renewables developer Acciona to explore opportunities for offshore wind projects in Spain and Portugal, which are in the early phase of policy and industry development. The Spanish Government is expected to set out its offshore wind strategy later this year. These markets will not reach the size of the North Sea, but over the longer term do have attractive potential.\n\nFurther afield, SSE Renewables is continuing to build networks and explore options and expects to make further progress over the next year focusing on Europe, North America and Japan. SSE Renewables sees value in a diverse pipeline, but it will retain its capital discipline.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.",

These assets play a key transitional role in the SSE Group, and wider energy system, in balancing the system on the journey to net zero. While providing much-needed system flexibility to ensure stability and security of supply in the short term, SSE Thermal is actively developing options to progressively decarbonise its fleet.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSE Thermal's Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) fleet is among the most flexible in the UK and Ireland electricity systems and is creating value from its intraday flexibility. Providing flexibility through the Balancing Mechanism is an increasingly important earnings stream. In 2020/21, the SSE Thermal fleet delivered significant value to the system during tight periods and responded to the market during periods of high demand and low wind, with a 50% increase in response contracted by National Grid. This demonstrates the importance of flexible, dispatchable generation in ensuring a resilient power sector in the transition to net zero.\n\nHowever, SSE is in no doubt about the need to decarbonise its fleet and repurpose it for the net zero world. In 2020/21, the carbon intensity of the electricity generated by its thermal plant reached its lowest level since records began. This means that SSE is well on the way towards two of its key sciencebased targets: to cut the carbon intensity of electricity generated by 60% and good progress is made to cut all scope 1 and scope 2 operational emissions by 40% between 2018 and 2030.\n\nSSE Thermal's assets have been awarded the following capacity contracts in GB and Ireland through competitive auctions.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nIn terms of SSE's older plant, with the exception of Keadby 2, Marchwood, Great Island and potentially Seabank, SSE cannot envisage any of its thermal plant running into the 2030s unabated. Therefore, its focus is on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen.\n\nSSE Thermal has announced an agreement with Equinor to co-develop low-carbon thermal options at its Keadby site, in North Lincolnshire, and at its Peterhead site, in Aberdeenshire. This will include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We are providing the firm, flexible capacity that is needed to balance the variability of renewables and, as we decarbonise our fleet, we have exciting options at Keadby and Peterhead with the potential to create value from lowcarbon technologies in the transition to net zero.'\n\n## Stephen Wheeler\n\nManaging Director,\n\nSSE Thermal\n\n- \u00b7 Keadby CCS - a 900MW gas-fired power station with carbon capture and Peterhead CCS - a 900MW gas-fired power station with carbon capture, both of which have the potential to be the UK's first power plants with carbon capture facilities.\n- \u00b7 Keadby Hydrogen - a 900MW lowcarbon hydrogen-fired power station, with a peak demand for hydrogen of 1800MW. This could be the world's first major hydrogen-fired power station.\n\nThese plans would support the UK's transition to net zero and accelerate the decarbonisation of some of the UK's most carbon intensive regions, underpinning investment in shared carbon and hydrogen pipelines which other emitters in the region could plug into. The projects at Keadby would utilise the pipelines being developed by the Zero Carbon Humber partnership, of which SSE Thermal is a member. The project at Peterhead would be an early customer for the Acorn CCS infrastructure.",

Final investment decisions will depend on the progress of policy frameworks that support delivery of the shared infrastructure, create routes to market for CCS and hydrogen technologies, and represent an appropriate balance of risk and reward.\n\nKeadby 2, SSE Thermal's \u00a3350m 893MW CCGT brings Siemens' first-of-a-kind, high efficiency, gas-fired generation technology to the UK and is on track to\n\nbe fully commissioned in 2022. As part of the co-operation agreement with Equinor, SSE Thermal is also developing options to blend hydrogen at Keadby 2.\n\nSSE Thermal completed the sale of its 50% share in Multifuel Energy Limited (MEL1) and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (MEL2) to First Sentier Investors for a total cash consideration of \u00a3995m, creating considerable value for shareholders. This included Ferrybridge Multifuel 1 and Ferrybridge Multifuel 2 energy-from-waste assets, which SSE had jointly developed,\n\n## Gas Storage\n\n## Gas Storage key performance indicators\n\n|                                                              | March   2021   | March   2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Gas Storage                                                  |                |                |\n| Gas Storage adjusted operating (loss)/profit - \u00a3m            | (5.7)          | 3.7            |\n| Gas Storage reported operating profit/(loss) - \u00a3m            | 2.8            | (1.4)          |\n| Gas storage adjusted investment and capital expenditure - \u00a3m | 1.9            | 0.2            |\n\n## Gas Storage overview\n\nSSE Thermal holds around 40% of the UK's conventional underground gas storage capacity. These assets can play an important role in the transition to net zero, supporting security of supply with the UK's continuing shift away from coalfired generation and the resulting loss of inherent energy storage in coal stocks.\n\nIn 2020/21 these assets were used to respond to unpredictable and changeable weather conditions, particularly in the January to March period.\n\nSSE Thermal remains committed to working with UK Government departments and Ofgem to ensure that the critical role of UK storage in relation to security of\n\nconstructed and operated before securing value on sale. In April 2020, SSE Thermal also sold a 50% stake in Slough Multifuel, SSE's only energy-from-waste interest, to Copenhagen Infrastructure Company (CIP).

It continues to invest in digital and customer service solutions to adapt and evolve its offerings in a highly competitive market.\n\nIn response to coronavirus, remote working was successfully implemented across the business, prioritising the\n\nsafety and wellbeing of customer service operations. Physical services such as meter reading, smart meter installation activities and field debt collections were paused but are now operating effectively as lockdowns are eased.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nBusiness Energy will work together with SSE's distributed energy operations under a single customer-facing brand, SSE Energy Solutions. SSE Energy Solutions will provide customers with a single 'shopfront' for Energy Supply and Energy Optimisation solutions. It will offer an expanded product portfolio including customer workplace EV charging solutions and flexible corporate power purchase agreement offerings. This year will also see the launch of its 'Next Generation' green supply product to help businesses meet their own net zero targets. SSE believes that the division will be increasingly important as a complement to SSE Renewables growth plans.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.\n\n- * Cornwall Insight figures released January 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges with reduced demand and constraints on our operations, but throughout we maintained our focus on our customers and continued to provide a valuable route to market for the Group's renewables and energy solutions in both GB and the island of Ireland.'\n\nNikki Flanders\n\nManaging Director, SSE's customer businesses",

Airtricity retains a strong market position as Ireland's largest supplier of 100% green energy, supplying approximately 680,000 customers and holding 23% market share by load.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nAirtricity has a solid diversified customer mix with 23.1% market share of Power by Volume and 22.9% Gas by Volume, split across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It retains a competitive position in the markets in which it operates.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Airtricity's priority was the safety and wellbeing of its teams. Non-domestic demand reduced as economic activity scaled back but was partly offset by increased demand from households. Several physical services were suspended due to lockdown restrictions, including door-to-door sales and residential\n\nconstruction projects such as housing upgrades. These services are now operating effectively as lockdown restrictions are eased across the island of Ireland.\n\nAirtricity continued to pursue its strategic imperatives in 2020/21, including the launch of its 'One-Stop Shop' in September 2020 in conjunction with An Post, a first of its kind in the ROI market, providing customers with energy efficient home upgrades and practical routes to reducing their usage.\n\nAirtricity also delivered the next phase of the Microsoft Solar for Schools programme, with 27 installations completed at schools around the country, providing real-time tracking of grid carbon emissions, screens displaying real-time solar generation and an education programme for students focusing on sustainability.\n\nThe business continues to prioritise delivery of high-quality customer service.\n\nDigitisation is key to seamless customer journeys and in 2020/21, SSE Airtricity launched a mobile app with a new online billing capability. In addition, it launched the first phase of its Smart Services, a major milestone in the ROI National Smart Metering Programme and key to supporting its customers on their net zero journey.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nSSE Airtricity continues to support customers and empower communities in their transition towards a greener future. A key area of focus is the provision of extended services and offerings, including a new partnership with ePower on electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Additional partnership opportunities are being explored around lighting-as-a-service, solar and Corporate Power Purchase Agreements.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To give its B2B customers a new single point of entry, SSE is replacing its Enterprise brand with 'SSE Energy Solutions', which brings distributed energy and business energy services under a single customer-facing brand, as outlined above.\n\nIn April 2021, SSE announced it had entered into an agreement to sell its Contracting (and Rail) business to the Aurelius Group at an enterprise value of \u00a327.5m as part of its ongoing disposal programme of non-core assets. The sale process is expected to complete by the end of June 2021 when around 1,900 Contracting employees will work under the new ownership. Under Aurelius, the Contracting business should benefit from greater focus, enabling it to take fuller advantage of growth opportunities.\n\nSSE retains a 50% stake in SSE Enterprise Telecoms, which provides infrastructurebased connectivity. This year it launched its new brand name: Neos Networks. Its transformation journey began in 2019, when Infracapital acquired 50% of the business and it retains a strong and growing customer base.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nElsewhere in Enterprise the distributed energy business has continued to maintain its existing portfolio of heat networks, private wires and distributed generation efficiently and effectively.\n\nWhilst run at arm's length from the rest of the group, SSE Enterprise Telecoms continues to grow its network and customer base and intends to more than double its BT exchange reach by connecting 550 BT exchanges by the end of summer 2021.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nGoing forward, the primary focus for Enterprise will be distributed energy and developing 'whole system thinking' solutions which will enable the decarbonisation of transport and heating and lay the platform for a data-driven and sustainable world, including: distributed generation, energy optimisation, heat and cooling networks, electrical networks, smart buildings and EV charging. SSE Enterprise is developing offerings in solar and has plans to develop over 500MW of battery storage across the UK to help respond to the needs of local generation. Initially its focus is on redeveloping existing SSE sites with grid connections.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.\n\nFinancial performance in Enterprise was heavily impacted by the effects of coronavirus on its Contracting and Rail business which is being sold to Aurelius.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'SSE Enterprise has undergone a period of transformational change with the sale of its Contracting business and a timely refocusing on distributed energy which promises strong growth potential through 'whole system thinking' solutions, including distributed generation and storage, which will also enable the decarbonisation of transport and heating.'\n\nNeil Kirkby Managing Director, SSE Enterprise",

Each commodity has different liquidity characteristics, which impacts on the quantum of hedging possible. See also SSE's Hedging Position at 31 March 2021 earlier in this document.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn January 2021, under the leadership of a new managing director, a comprehensive review was undertaken to determine how EPM could best support the SSE Group strategy within a rapidly evolving energy landscape. This identified a critical role for EPM to play as the short-term energy market asset optimiser and a long-term energy market adviser. This role enables SSE to focus its investment in energy markets capabilities in one centre of excellence.\n\nThe value EPM secures for SSE's asset portfolio will continue to be reported against individual Business Units.\n\n2020/21 was a turbulent year in carbon policy with the UK deciding to introduce its own UK Emissions Trading Scheme alongside the existing Carbon Price Support. While this has created uncertainties which SSE has had to manage prudently, SSE is encouraged that all policy scenarios lead to high carbon pricing, which SSE supports as a critical tool in decarbonisation.\n\n## Opportunities for growth\n\nIn addition to taking on responsibility for SSE'S Energy Economics and Market Codes teams, EPM plans to further develop its risk management and trading teams and introduce a new analytics function. These enhanced data capabilities will support decision making and enable further value creation on behalf of the Group's Business Units.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review under Operating Profit Performance 2020/21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'With an eye to the pace of change we are seeing in the energy sector, we have reviewed and stepped up EPM's role within SSE as an asset optimiser and market adviser to the Group's Business Units, and put plans in place to strengthen our data analytics capabilities.'\n\nFinlay McCutcheon Managing Director, Energy Portfolio Management\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## SECTION 172 AND NON/hyphen.caseFINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENTS\n\n## COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY\n\n## Section 172 Statement\n\nSSE has an unwritten social contract with its stakeholders that both informs decision making by the Board and aligns closely with the spirit of Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (Section 172). Under this contract SSE relies on society for public services and infrastructure, human capital and the implicit right to earn a profit and remunerate shareholders. In return it safely and reliably provides energy, invests in critical national infrastructure needed for net zero, creates jobs and contributes to GDP through fair payment of tax.\n\nThis Statement summarises how, over the course of 2020/21, the Board has upheld this contract by promoting the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of SSE's six key stakeholder groups ( see pages 28 to 31 \uf150 ). This has been undertaken with regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1)(a) to (f), being:\n\n- (a) The likely consequences of any decision in the long term.\n- (b) The interests of the Company's employees.\n- (c) The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others.\n- (d) The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment.\n- (e) The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct.\n- (f)  The need to act fairly between members of the Company.\n\nSSE's approach to the above social contract is exemplified throughout this Annual Report, with specific disclosures of decisions and actions which are supportive of this Section 172 Statement detailed as follows.\n\n## Long-term direction\n\nSSE's strategy is to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero. Four 2030 business goals support this strategy, and provide important interim milestones to net zero in 2050. This longer-term view set by the Board frames its annual review of strategy and agreement\n\nof objectives which extends to capex plans, the Group budget, dividend plans and future resourcing requirements. SSE's Risk Management Framework, including the Groups' Principal Risks, the identification of emerging risks and the Group's Risk Appetite statement, further underpins the Board's long-term approach.\n\n## More on the longer-term context\n\n- \u00b7 Pages 8 to 9 \uf150 Our purpose and our strategy .

Supporting conversations have been conducted within a well-established framework that encourages both Group and complementary Boardlevel engagement. This is reflective of SSE's operating model based on autonomous Business Units in which decision-making takes place every day. The Board creates the correct conditions for this approach by setting SSE's long-term direction and the overarching decision-making framework and culture. This is in line with the Board's own understanding of stakeholder needs.\n\n## More on engagement\n\n- \u00b7 Page 104 \uf150 Considered decisionmaking .

        "page_content": "## CHAIR'S INTRODUCTION TO THE DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\n## GOVERNANCE FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nIt has been an unprecedented time in which to join the Board, and a period that has afforded me a deep understanding of the strength of leadership and culture within SSE. As the coronavirus pandemic has continued to impact on society, I have observed SSE's consideration of stakeholder needs and experiences, and the integration of these throughout work and discussions in the Boardroom. This approach reflects the Board's focus on embedding high standards of corporate governance, with the objective of the Directors' Report being to provide a transparent and engaging account of this in practice.\n\n## Strength of purpose\n\nThe clarity of our purpose - to provide energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow - has guided actions at every level throughout the year. In the immediate term, this meant unbroken support for the national response to coronavirus through the safe and reliable supply of essential services. Across a longer time horizon, it has driven strategic progress and identified opportunities to secure a sustainable energy system for the future. The Board recognises the collective contribution and commitment of SSE's more than 10,000 employees in the above, and is proud of what has been achieved during a time of uncertainty and challenge.\n\nThe pandemic has not distracted from the enduring challenge presented by the climate emergency and the important part SSE has to play in the net zero transition, which as described across pages 106 to 109 \uf150 , will continue as the backdrop to the Board's long-term strategic focus.\n\nIt is with this in mind that we look forward to working with government to support its efforts to secure the best possible outcomes from the COP26 summit later this year.\n\n## Assessing risk\n\nOpportunities must be assessed against the related parameter of risk, to ensure decisions are taken responsibly and in good faith to deliver acceptable stakeholder outcomes. To maintain an informed view, the Board has taken soundings on matters such as the political landscape, long-term commodity pricing, project economics, and seabed leasing. Throughout the year, the risk presented by the pandemic has been considered through a monthly review of its impact on financial and operational performance.\n\nThe formal assessment of the overarching risk environment which confirms the Group's risk appetite and its Principal Risks was completed in March 2021. This followed engagement between individual Board members and SSE's Group Risk function in the course of the year, to provide challenge to, and gain detailed insight into, the risk management practices currently undertaken. Details of the Group approach can be found on pages 54 to 63 \uf150 .\n\nGiven the close alignment of both our purpose and strategy to the net zero transition, the impact and risks associated with climate change are integrated across the Board's and management's considerations. This is a multi-dimensional approach, and one which I hope is evident throughout this Annual Report and accompanying Sustainability Report.\n\n## Enhancing Board dialogue\n\nSocial distancing guidelines have resulted in significant changes to the way we work and engage. With the inability to meet physically, a comprehensive engagement programme complemented by two all-employee surveys and the work of Dame Sue Bruce, our Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, has drawn on technology to create new platforms for conversations at all levels. Whilst not a direct substitute for in-person discussion, these have been successful in keeping the Board and senior leadership in touch with employee sentiment and we will retain the aspects which have\n\nworked well. Employee engagement, including what we have heard in the year, and the actions taken in response, is covered on pages 114 to 116 \uf150 .\n\nThe Board has also adopted a virtual platform for its own meetings which has proven effective to progress our full agenda. And I extend my appreciation to those individuals who have inducted me virtually, a process which has been well-managed and provided a wide introduction to the SSE Group. When safe to do so, I look forward to meeting colleagues in person, as do my fellow Board members.\n\n## Monitoring culture\n\nBeing new to SSE it has been important to reflect and learn about SSE's culture first hand. Prior to joining, I was introduced to SSE's approach to 'Doing the Right Thing', underpinned by the core values set out on page 8 \uf150 and the primary focus on safety. Understanding how these translate into SSE's culture has been enhanced by the conversations I mention above and through exposure to the work of the Board Committees and discussions with senior leadership teams.\n\nThe maturing cultural dashboard which the Board reviews bi-annually is in its second year. This was last considered in November 2020 and is a rich source of information that will continue to inform the Board's appreciation of cultural indicators and allow identification of cultural changes and trends. The impact of coronavirus on reported metrics will be monitored as we progress through 2021/22, alongside actions to reiterate broader cultural expectations. Combined with our engagement work, this will continue to shape how the Board influences and understands culture, as covered on pages 112 to 113 \uf150 .\n\n## Evaluating Board performance\n\nCentral to setting the correct tone is the review of the Board's own performance. An internal assessment was carried out in 2020/21, in advance of an external evaluation in the coming year. The positive outcomes of this were well received, and in the spirit of continuous improvement, we were pleased to hear areas to work on. These included arrangements to ensure the right balance between presentations and",

        "page_content": "discussion in Board meetings and, through elevation of the role of the Nomination Committee, the agreement to identify opportunities for Board-level support on the issue of inclusion and diversity. This support extends to considerations surrounding the Board's own diversity, as well as that of senior management, wider teams and new recruits, alongside the approach to addressing sector-wide challenges.\n\nThe suite of evaluation actions from 2020/21, alongside progress against the findings from 2019/20, are set out on pages 118 to 119 \uf150 . The discussions surrounding inclusion and diversity are on pages 126 to 127 \uf150 .\n\n## Working for stakeholders\n\nSection 172 has never been in sharper focus, and the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters to investors continues to grow at pace. To ensure the Board remains in touch with material issues and concerns, it has received a combination of dedicated stakeholder-focused updates and engaged constructively on Group-wide issues with key stakeholder groups during the year. This approach is supported by business-led stakeholder relationships as explained on pages 28 to 31 \uf150 and within the Section 172 Statement on page 92 \uf150 .\n\nThe Board's annual review of sustainability priorities reflects SSE's wider social contract, which in 2020/21 saw the adoption of an enhanced sustainable procurement strategy and a commitment to achieving net zero within all scopes of SSE's own operations by 2050. In the coming year, Board decisionmaking will continue to be tested through external soundings on strategy. Work is also under way to review the current breadth of focus provided by the Safety, Health, Environment and Advisory Committee, to assist the Board in its oversight of the approach to, and assurance of, a range of ESG matters.\n\nShareholder views remain a key influence and have been gathered through the year within investor meetings, conferences and the engagement which surrounded the AGM 2020. I look forward to taking part in these events in the months to come. The Board encourages continued participation through the AGM 2021, which will include opportunities for interaction before and during the meeting. This includes a platform\n\nto allow shareholders to view proceedings and ask questions remotely for the first time. To support ongoing engagement with shareholders on climate-related issues, we have proposed an enabling resolution, within the business of the meeting, that establishes a framework for an annual advisory vote on SSE's Net Zero Transition report at future AGMs.\n\n## Board changes\n\nThere have been two additions to the Board in the year. Dame Angela Strank joined as a non-Executive Director on 1 May 2020, followed by myself on 1 September 2020. Having received a warm welcome from our fellow Directors, we look forward to another year of working together across the Board and respective Committees. The Board was sorry to see Crawford Gillies step down on 30 September 2020 and we express our gratitude for his contribution throughout his five years as Senior Independent Director. I am grateful to Tony Cocker who assumed the role of Senior Independent Director following this departure, and who will bring significant industry knowledge and experience to the position.\n\nFollowing the above changes, the composition of the Board aligns with the ambitions set by the Hampton-Alexander and Parker reviews for achievement by FTSE 100 companies in 2020 and 2021. Our approach to driving enduring balance within the Board is set out in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 120 to 127 \uf150 .\n\nFinally, I thank Richard Gillingwater on behalf of myself and all the Directors for his strong leadership and vision. Since joining SSE in 2007, he worked as a non-Executive Director, Senior Independent Director, Deputy Chair and Chair. His contribution to the shape of the SSE Group is evident, and I appreciate the experience and skill of the Board which he has assembled.\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair, SSE plc 25 May 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance highlights\n\nBoard Leadership and Company\n\nPurpose\n\npages 102 to 116 \uf150\n\nDivision of Responsibilities\n\npage 117 \uf150\n\nComposition, Succession and\n\nEvaluation\n\npages 118 to 127 \uf150\n\nAudit, Risk and Internal Control\n\npages 128 to 143 \uf150\n\nRemuneration pages 144 to 165\n\n\uf150\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Board continues to assess its approach to corporate governance through application of the FRC's UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). It reports against the 2018 Code for the year ended 31 March 2021, a copy of which can be found at www.frc.org.uk.\n\nAs set out above, this Annual Report has been structured to allow evaluation by shareholders of how the Code Principles have been applied. Appropriate cross references are included where supporting information is contained outside of the Directors' Report.\n\nThe Board believes that the spirit of the 2018 Code continues to be upheld throughout its work and that of its Committees, and reports one instance of non-compliance for 2020/21 against the Code Provisions. This was in relation to Chair tenure (Provision 19) and is a position which was rectified on 1 April 2021 following the appointment of Sir John Manzoni.\n\nThe process which concluded the previously agreed actions to ensure an appropriate Chair transition can be found on page 124 \uf150 .",

        "page_content": "## The role of the Board\n\nThe primary role of the Board is to lead the SSE Group in a way that ensures its long-term success. This is a wide-ranging duty and is guided by the cornerstones of SSE's purpose and vision. The last material re-definition of SSE's purpose and vision was in 2019/20, when the Board agreed further alignment with the Group's societal role, its net zero ambitions and strategic transformation structured around core and complementary businesses.\n\nFollowing on from purpose and vision the Board sets the Group's strategy. This is centred on sustainable value creation for shareholders and considers SSE's wider contract with its key stakeholders. The implementation of strategy is led by the Group Executive Committee and management across SSE's Business Units. Further information of SSE's business model and strategic progress in 2020/21 is covered across pages 1 to 93 \uf150 .\n\n## Board reserved matters\n\nSupporting purpose, vision and strategy and SSE's long term position, the Board retains a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. These are areas material to the Group's direction, people and resilience, and include:\n\n- \u00b7 Agreement and monitoring of a healthy corporate culture including SSE's values.\n- \u00b7 Approval of key financial communications and SSE's dividend policy.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring sound systems of internal control and risk management.\n- \u00b7 Changes to the Group's capital structure.\n- \u00b7 Changes to Board and Board Committee structure, size and composition.\n- \u00b7 Approval of the electricity distribution and transmission price control reviews proposed by Ofgem.\n- \u00b7 Material changes to the rules of the Company pension schemes.\n- \u00b7 Major transactions.\n\n## Group Executive Committee\n\nThe membership of the Group Executive Committee comprises the Executive Directors, the Managing Directors of SSE's core Business Units and the General Counsel. The Director of HR and the Director of Corporate Affairs and Strategy attend every meeting in full.\n\n## Alistair Phillips-Davies\n\nChief Executive, Member\n\n## Gregor Alexander\n\nFinance Director, Member\n\n## Martin Pibworth\n\nGroup Energy and Commercial Director, Member\n\n## Sally Fairbairn\n\nCompany Secretary and Director of Investor Relations, Committee Secretary\n\nBiographical details can be found at sse.com \uf295\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRob McDonald\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMD, SSEN Transmission, Member\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLiz Tanner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral Counsel, Member\n\nSam Peacock\n\nDirector of Corporate Affairs and Strategy, Regular Attendee\n\nJim Smith MD SSE Renewables, MemberChris Burchell MD, SSEN Distribution, Member\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Stewart\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector of HR, Regular Attendee\n\nThe Schedule of Reserved Matters is one of a collection of documents and policies which make up SSE's Board Charter. The contents of the Board Charter govern the Board's operations and pertinent Groupwide matters and is subject to annual Board approval.\n\nThe Board Charter contains:\n\n- \u00b7 Articles of Association.*\n- \u00b7 Schedule of Reserved Matters.*\n- \u00b7 SSE's Guide to Good Business Ethics.*\n- \u00b7 SSE's Guide to Governance.\n- \u00b7 Board Committee Terms of Reference.*\n- \u00b7 Non-Audit Services Policy.*\n- \u00b7 Procedure for Taking Independent Advice.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Directors' Shareholding Policy.\n- \u00b7 Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy.*\n- \u00b7 Responsibilities of key Board roles. *\n- * Documents available in full at sse.com \uf295\n\n## Corporate governance within SSE\n\nWithin SSE, corporate governance can be explained as the minimum expectations set by the Board surrounding standards, responsible conduct and controls. The Governance Framework specifically maps out where accountability resides in line with delegated authorities and forms part of the Group's System of Internal Control, see page 137 \uf150 .\n\nAreas of importance to both the Board and the Group's operations influence the features of the Governance Framework. This is illustrated in part by the Committees which have been agreed to provide dedicated focus to areas on behalf of the Board and the Group Executive Committee.\n\nOversight of delegated matters is supported by formal reporting channels. For Board Committees this is a personal account from the non-Executive Director who chairs the Committee. On executive matters, the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Group Energy and Commercial Director are charged with providing full updates at each Board meeting. This is in addition to minutes, written reports and KPIs to monitor financial and non-financial performance.\n\n## Board operations\n\nThe Board, led by the Chair, seeks to nurture a Boardroom in which informed and transparent decision-making takes place. This is supported by clearly defined Board roles ( see page 117 \uf150 ) and constructive dialogue within and outside of meetings.\n\nStructured agendas are developed by the Chair, Chief Executive and Company Secretary who consider the Board's annual plan of business and the current status of projects, strategic workstreams and the overarching operating context. Adequate time is allocated to support effective and constructive discussion, and guidance is available to authors and presenters of Board materials. An electronic meeting portal allows efficient navigation of papers, information and requests. Details of Board meeting activity in 2020/21 can be found on pages 106 to 111 \uf150 .\n\nWith one of the key responsibilities of the non-Executive Directors being to challenge and provide counsel, it is deemed appropriate that relationships can be built with different levels across the Group. The Board therefore has unfettered access to senior leadership, their teams and specialist functions. For details of employee engagement and knowledge development in 2020/21 see pages 114 to 116 and 123 \uf150 .",

The decision-making context stems from SSE's Governance Framework explained on pages 102 to 103 \uf150 , with the Board confirming key parameters and expectations. These include SSE's purpose, vision, strategy and culture and the approach to reflecting stakeholder views within long-term plans and day-to-day operations. The connectivity between these concepts is depicted opposite.\n\n## Our purpose\n\nTo provide energy needed today, while building a better world of energy for tomorrow.\n\n## Our vision\n\nTo be a leading energy company in a net zero world.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nTo create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero.\n\n## Our culture\n\nSee pages 112 to 113 \uf150 .\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\nSSE's stakeholders are people, communities and organisations with an interest in SSE's purpose, strategy, operations and actions and who may be affected by them.\n\n## Stakeholder views\n\nThe Board shapes the framework within which stakeholder relationships are developed and maintained; confirming SSE's key stakeholder groups and the purpose of stakeholder engagement in relation to decision-making and strategy. These principles, alongside SSE's key stakeholder relationships and engagement in 2020/21 are explained on pages 28 to 31 \uf150 .\n\nTo ensure meaningful reflection of stakeholder views across all of SSE's business operations, breadth and depth of stakeholder engagement is required. The scale of this activity cannot be discharged by the Board alone and it therefore encourages a progressive approach to engagement through a network of mature executive and business-led stakeholder relationships across the Group. Robust oversight and\n\nunderstanding of stakeholder views at Board level is gathered through a combination of direct engagement and reporting of below Board activity. This supports the timely recognition of emerging stakeholder issues, and ensures Board engagement complements the expectation that senior leadership and SSE's Business Units take demonstrable account of stakeholder views in their decisions and longer-term objectives. Direct and indirect Board engagement mechanisms are set out on pages 30 to 31 \uf150 , with additive detail on shareholders and debt providers on page 105 \uf150 and employees on pages 114 to 116 \uf150 .\n\nThe influence of stakeholder views within the Board's own work is exemplified across the Directors' Report. This includes, but is not limited to, the Board's Principal Decisions on pages 107 to 109, 124 and 127 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo guide Board focus in 2021/22, engagement priorities have been agreed as follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Oversee the delivery of a comprehensive COP26 stakeholder engagement plan.\n- \u00b7 Engage with investors to confirm understanding of ESG-driven funds and UK/EU taxonomy.\n- \u00b7 Encourage AGM participation.\n- \u00b7 Further external soundings on strategy with framing around SSE's key stakeholder groups.\n- \u00b7 Prioritise conversations with employees on future ways of working and their contribution to strategy and tackling climate change.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholder and debt provider engagement\n\nSSE engages with equity and debt investors to understand the views of those that invest in SSE and to communicate its strategic plans, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) approach and financial performance. Investors are able to contact the Company at any time through SSE's dedicated channels ( see page 315 \uf150 ).\n\nRetail shareholders. To allow management of an individual's shareholding, SSE's investor website provides a source of equivalent information, housing all regulatory news announcements and published financial and non-financial reports. The Investor Relations team, and the Company Secretariat, with support from SSE's Registrar, engage with retail shareholders in response to private shareholding queries.\n\nInstitutional investor programme. Across 2020/21, standing engagement supported by SSE's Investor Relations team, comprised 112 one-to-one and 25 group meetings, representing direct engagement between the Board and over 40% of SSE's activelymanaged issued capital. These contacts were conducted virtually across investor roadshows, conferences and ad-hoc meetings. The majority of which were led by the Executive Directors, with the Chair, the Senior Independent Director, and members of SSE's senior leadership team joining where requested or deemed appropriate to the subject of the meeting. Conversations were more international with virtual visits to over 12 countries, and this form of meeting will continue as an available option.\n\nFeedback was provided to the Board following each engagement, supplemented by a monthly report of investor and market sentiment and share price performance, and two independent sessions co-ordinated by SSE's Brokers. Outcomes included improved disclosure around SSE's renewable operational fleet and development pipeline, its thermal generation assets, and its financial framework including a target net debt/ EBITDA ratio.\n\nESG. Engagement on ESG issues. Against the backdrop of increasing investor focus on ESG and sustainability practice, SSE has engaged regularly with shareholders\n\n## AGM 2020 AND 2021\n\nAGM 2020. The Board's overriding priorities for the format of SSE's AGM in 2020 were safety and the need to safeguard shareholder participation and engagement.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, social distancing measures and the Corporate Governance and Insolvency Bill, the Board agreed that shareholders would not attend the AGM in person. Supporting arrangements to encourage voting by proxy and submission of questions to the Board in advance were therefore put in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQuestions received were grouped by theme and responded to in full through a combination of a video presentation published on sse.com \uf295 on the day of the AGM and direct written reply. The engagement with Royal London Asset Managers and Friends Provident Foundation at this time, further resulted in the development of SSE's Just Transition strategy which is explained on page 45 \uf150 . Through proxy arrangements an equivalent level of share capital directed votes on meeting business, with all resolutions passed with in excess of 90.24% votes cast in favour.\n\non a broad range of ESG topics. As well as increasingly frequent discussions of ESG issues during regular investor engagement, numerous ESG-themed one-to-one meetings were held during the year and SSE's Finance Director, Group Energy and Commercial Director, and Chief Sustainability Officer, jointly presented at two ESG-themed investor events.\n\nESG ratings agencies. SSE actively engages with key ESG ratings agencies and investor-led initiatives to help demonstrate SSE's performance to its stakeholders, while allowing identification of areas for improvement in its operations and disclosure.\n\nAGM 2021. The learnings from the coronavirus context in 2020 identified opportunities for enhanced engagement arrangements for the AGM in 2021. It was recognised that methods for remote shareholder interaction were paramount, where any physical element of the meeting remains subject to government guidelines. Accordingly, shareholders will now be able to submit and have questions answered both in advance and during the meeting and observe proceedings in real time by webcast. Proxy arrangements remain in place to allow all shareholders to cast their vote in any resulting meeting format. To allow the fullest flexibilities for shareholder participation, the necessary authorities to hold hybrid meetings in the future are also being put to shareholder vote.\n\nGreen debt financing. Recognising increasing investor demand for debt used to fund sustainable assets, in March 2021, SSE - via SSEN Transmission - issued its fourth green bond in five years. The issuance reaffirmed SSE's status as the largest issuer of green bonds from the UK corporate sector, with over \u00a31.9bn in green debt outstanding. In addition, SSE has set out a new framework for issuing innovative sustainability-linked bonds in the future.\n\nRemuneration. The engagement between the Remuneration Committee Chair and SSE's largest shareholders on the expanded Group Energy and Commercial Director role, and associated terms, are set out on page 145 \uf150 .",

This work, which includes consideration of how value is generated and sustained, allows the Board to effectively oversee and confirm the continued appropriateness of SSE's business and operating model ( see pages 10 to 13 \uf150 ).\n\n## Strategic review in 2020/21\n\nBuilding on 2019/20. In 2019/20 the Board confirmed priorities to further SSE's position and safeguard its long-term success. These were confirmed on page 101 \uf150 of the Annual Report 2020. Progress made across 2020/21 is set out in the timeline above and discussed across the Board Principal Decisions on pages 107 to 109 \uf150 .\n\nReview inputs and discussion. The Board's review of Group strategy in 2020/21 focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 The external environment and how this impacts SSE and its stakeholders, including trends in policy, regulation, competitor behaviour, technology, energy markets and capital markets.\n\nThis review was supported by presentations from Colin Mayer of Sa\u00efd Business School on the role of responsible listed corporations in society and Flint Global on key policy and political trends. Further commentary on sector developments can be found on pages 24 to 27 \uf150 .\n\n- \u00b7 Growth , including a review of the size of growth markets and returns for opportunities in the transition to net zero.\n- \u00b7 SSE's strategic progress and its financial situation. This included progress against the previous year's strategic priorities, valuation of the SSE Group and scenario analysis of the five-year financial outlook.\n- \u00b7 Strategic choices for the next five years including capital allocation options.\n- \u00b7 The long-term shape of the SSE Group and implications for its investor proposition and financial strategy.\n\nAnalysis and debate was informed by a range of inputs from specialist teams including: Corporate Finance; Energy Economics; Business Unit leadership teams; and Group Strategy. Each Business Unit further presented detailed performance updates over the year to discuss and agree their own strategic priorities for progression. Key events of potential strategic were presented to the\n\nBoard as they arose, which saw discussion of the Energy White Paper, the 6th Carbon Budget, and the Crown Estate Offshore Leasing Round 4.\n\nOutput. The 2020/21 strategy review agreed the following areas for continued focus across a time horizon to 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 The evolution of the shape of the SSE Group.\n- \u00b7 Strategic priorities for the Group and each Business Unit.\n- \u00b7 Key decisions around SSE's capital allocations.\n\nLooking forward. In April 2021, the Board agreed a refinement of the description of the Group's strategy in order to ensure it more accurately articulated the existing strategy ahead of its strategic review work in 2021/22.",

        "page_content": "## BOARD PRINCIPAL DECISION WIND DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE\n\n## Background\n\n## Board discussion\n\n## Board stakeholder considerations and impacts\n\nThe Board remained appraised of stakeholder views through SSE Renewables' engagement strategy, in addition to those material issues identified by SSE's established engagement methods ( see pages 28 to 31 \uf150 ). A summary of the key considerations which informed Board decision making were:\n\n## Outcome, next steps and related decisions\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change and net zero. The transition to net zero is of material interest to society and through SSE's purpose, the Board is committed to supporting strategic opportunities which accelerate decarbonisation of the electricity system with an appropriate risk and return profile. The Board's advocacy priorities reflect SSE's net zero ambitions which are consistent with the UK Government's offshore wind ambitions, and more recently, the Government's Ten Point Plan.\n- \u00b7 Supporting a green economic recovery. In line with SSE's social contract, the Board recognised the potential contribution large-scale project investment could have on local economies, namely through the creation of highly skilled jobs and in supporting indigenous supply chains.\n- \u00b7 Working for customers. A material issue to energy customers is the cost of electricity supply, and increasingly, the ability to trace the source of electricity generation. When complete, the capacity of the total Seagreen, Dogger Bank and Viking projects have the potential to deliver enough renewable output to power 8.1 million homes. The Board will continue to advocate for the right conditions for investment in renewable infrastructure to deliver a sustainable and affordable energy system.\n- \u00b7 Combining expertise. The opportunity presented by strategic partnerships to deliver excellence through the combining of expertise is consistent with SSE's strategy and values. Given the large scale of these wind projects, working with partners was deemed an appropriate risk mitigation for the construction phase and allows the deployment of capital in a more diverse portfolio of projects.\n- \u00b7 Shareholders and debt providers. The trajectory and pace of SSE's renewables strategy has been transparently reported and subject to discussion and support in investor meetings. When approving FID, the Board considered the returns which would be acceptable to investors in each case.\n\nThe Board approved the FID in the Seagreen 1, Dogger Bank A and B, and Viking wind projects between April and September 2020, all of which progressed to financial close. Consistent with the partnering approach, a sale in the stakes of Seagreen and Dogger Bank to Total and Eni respectively was approved and completed in June 2020 and February 2021. To further SSE Renewables' ambitions, and following the successful delivery of key project milestones, endorsement was provided for an aspirational run rate of at least 1GW (net) of new assets a year during the second half of the decade. Supporting activity for this has been Board-approved participation in the Crown Estate Round 4 seabed auctions and the seeking of international opportunities to support portfolio diversification across different geographies and markets.\n\n## Strategic link:\n\nLink to Principal Risk:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate Change\n\nLarge Capital Projects Management\n\nSee also:\n\nPages 17, 19 and 83 to 85 \uf150 .\n\nKey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2019/20 and 2020/21, the Board confirmed priorities to support the growth of SSE Renewables' wind development pipeline. These have been furthered by one of SSE's 2030 business goals; to develop and build enough infrastructure to treble the output of SSE's renewable energy to 30TWh per annum. In line with the above, Board consideration was required in 2020/21 surrounding the Final Investment Decisions (FID) in the Seagreen 1 (offshore, 1075MW*), Dogger Bank A and B (offshore, 2,400MW*) and Viking (onshore, 443MW*) wind projects.\n\n- * total project capacity with SSE's share is in line with its equity holding.\n\nAll large capital projects within SSE are subject to an agreed governance framework, where set criteria must be met to allow progression through key milestones. Prior to reaching FID, Board assurance is provided through these governance arrangements in relation to project development, safety, design, and risk. In each case, the decision to move into the project execution phase saw Board evaluation of:\n\n- \u00b7 total capex, project economics and funding;\n- \u00b7 engineering and construction findings;\n- \u00b7 contracting strategy including the potential coronavirus impact on supply chain;\n- \u00b7 overall project risk; and\n- \u00b7 UK energy market design.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its creation followed structured consultation with SSEN Transmission's  stakeholders over a two-year period and committed to the delivery of five goals which had been designed to meet  stakeholder expectations. During development, the Board remained updated on business plan progress and the  supporting constructive stakeholder engagement, including that with the GB Energy Regulator, Ofgem, throughout  its determination process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board discussion             | Co-creation of a business plan with stakeholders was endorsed as the correct approach to allow SSEN Transmission  to simultaneously attract the investment needed to tackle the issue of climate change, whilst taking account of  evidence-based stakeholder needs. Following the publication in December 2020 of Ofgem's Final Determinations  for the RIIO-T2 period, and Ofgem's subsequent consultation on associated licence condition modifications, the  Board noted the broad support for SSEN Transmission's stakeholder-led business plan. However, it also recognised  that certain technical but very important issues required correction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Board stakeholder            | SSEN Transmission deploys a range of communication methods, within an agreed engagement strategy, to actively  listen and gather stakeholder views. For RIIO-T2 this included a dedicated Network for Net Zero Stakeholder Group.  The outputs of this overarching engagement work have been considered by the Board through the below, with  the Board further cognisant of the longer-term position, in which the outcomes of the RIIO-T2 price control could  impact upon future price controls. \u00b7  Firm commitment to the business plan.  The business plan is supported by five clear goals which create  stakeholder benefit through: the transportation of renewable energy consistent with net zero ambitions;  transmission network reliability for homes and businesses; the delivery of all customer connections on time;   a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; and efficiency savings from innovation. Long-term success. |\n| considerations   and impacts | \u00b7  The business plan, including the significant investments in the network that will go through  uncertainty mechanisms as part of the RIIO-T2 price control, was produced to: protect current and future  consumers; maintain security of supply; and act on climate change while attracting the investment that creates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| steps and related            | Strategic link: Link to Principal Risk: Climate Change Energy Affordability and Politics See also: Pages 21 and 79 to 80  \uf150 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Outcome, next  decisions     | The Board confirmed its support surrounding SSEN Transmission's intention to appeal certain elements of Ofgem's  RIIO-T2 price control settlement to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The appeal is both technical  and narrow in scope, focused on areas where Ofgem's decision does not reflect the robust evidence provided  throughout the price control process, alongside material errors in the decision. A conclusion to the appeal is  expected by November 2021. The Board will remain updated as the CMA considers the merits of the appeal and   will oversee enaction of the business plan which is now underway and contributing to the transition to net zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The investment in Keadby 2 signalled early support for efficient lower-carbon technology within this important asset class. This has been followed by consideration of the possible investment opportunities presented by clean carbon, capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen fuelled generation, to tackle climate change whilst ensuring continued security of supply across the energy system.\n\nAcross 2020/21, the Board received detailed updates from the SSE Thermal senior leadership team allowing assessment of development opportunities, and their strategic fit with SSE's net zero and sustainability ambitions including its 2030 business goals. This included optionality within the traditionally carbon intensive Humber cluster; an area in which Keadby 2 and the potential development of Keadby CCS, a gas fired power station with carbon capture technology, are located.\n\nThrough formal consultation surrounding Keadby CCS and SSE's established stakeholder engagement mechanisms ( see pages 28 to 31 \uf150 ), the below matters were reflected across Board discussions in the year:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable electricity system. Flexible thermal generation plays a pivotal part to ensure a reliable energy system that supports the supply of essential services to society. Dispatchable thermal plant with minimal emissions can continue to fulfil this key role whilst contributing to the UK's net zero targets. SSE's own science based targets remain a key baseline against which to judge the low-carbon fit of future investments and CCS and hydrogen are deemed to complement this pathway.\n- \u00b7 A Just Transition. Investment within industrial regions is a key principle within SSE's view of a just transition. Existing skills and knowledge can be deployed across green technologies, in which workers and local communities are supported through the protection of existing jobs and creation of new employment opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Progressive partnering. Complementary skills, a common investment approach and shared stakeholder and policy views are key inputs into SSE's partnering strategy. Further developing the long-standing relationship with Equinor, which includes mutual involvement in the Zero Carbon Humber partnership, was confirmed as a natural progression to allow joint development of valuable low carbon opportunities both in the Humber cluster and elsewhere in the UK.\n- \u00b7 Developing appropriate governance. Robust regulatory and policy frameworks are key to driving new investment with fair returns for developers, operators and end customers. The adequacy of proposed support to align with the UK Government's ambition for these new technologies will be monitored to ensure they translate into a compelling case for all stakeholders.\n\nThe Board confirmed entry into a cooperation agreement with Equinor to jointly develop Keadby CCS and Keadby Hydrogen. Research and development of the supporting CCS and hydrogen technologies will be progressed under the partnership, alongside options to further decarbonise the Keadby 2 project through hydrogen blending. It was announced in May 2021, the scope of the co-operation agreement was expanded to include the Peterhead CCS Power Station in Aberdeenshire. Engagement with government, regulators and stakeholders will continue, with any Final Investment Decisions dependent on the progress of policy frameworks that are commensurate with the delivery of this net zero enabling infrastructure. Sessions on the role of clusters and hydrogen technology in support of emerging climate science have been agreed for integration into future Board work.\n\n## Strategic link:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLink to Principal Risk: Climate Change Energy Infrastructure Failure Large Capital Projects Management\n\nSee also:\n\nPages 20 and 86 to 87 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This pervasive context is reflected within the agreed definition of a healthy corporate culture for SSE and is the baseline against which cultural guidance is developed and tested.\n\n## Aligning culture with purpose, vision and strategy\n\nSSE's purpose, vision and strategy provide confirmation to employees and external stakeholders as to why SSE exists, what it is seeking to achieve and the direction which has been agreed to get there. Engagement with these elements to ensure everyone in SSE understands their contribution to the Group's long-term success, is fundamental to creating a culture that can be embraced at every organisational level.\n\n## Board support in 2020/21\n\nIn March 2020, the Board recognised the resilience of SSE's culture would be tested by the quickly evolving coronavirus situation. This saw a shift to critical worker status for front line staff and a working from home model for a significant proportion of the workforce. Unable to provide on-site support and have in-person conversations, two surveys were conducted in 2020/21 to understand how employees were feeling and what support was required. One outcome was a comprehensive communications strategy that could reach employees in all work settings and maintain engagement. The content covered both coronavirus related issues and an employee guide to strategy, with the Board involved in the delivery of key messages. Through virtual calls, employees were encouraged to submit questions for live discussion with the Board ( see pages 114 to 116 \uf150 ).\n\n## Guiding and promoting culture\n\nEthical business conduct within SSE is known as 'doing the right thing'. To support this, the Board confirms the appropriate values, attitudes and behaviours, to drive the creation of an inclusive and fair workplace in which responsible decisions are taken. Employee guidance is provided through the Board-approved SSE SET of values, SSE's Group Policies and an employee guide; all of which are supported\n\nby mandatory online training. Leading by example is re-enforced through the Board's own conduct and the communication to employees of key activity. Senior leaders across SSE's Business Units and Group Services have the same responsibility to lead, embed and oversee cultural standards.\n\nCultural signals at Board-level include:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE's Governance Framework and corporate governance practices ( see pages 102 to 104 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Board decision-making ( see pages 106 to 111 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 The approach to people strategy and leadership (see Nomination Committee on pages 120 to 127 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 SSE's risk, controls and compliance culture (see Audit Committee and EMRC on pages 128 to 139 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 The prime focus on safety, health and the environment (see SHEAC on pages 140 to 143 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Attitudes towards reward and remuneration (see Remuneration Committee on pages 144 to 165 \uf150 ).\n\n## Board support in 2020/21\n\nFollowing the refresh of SSE's Group Policies in 2019/20, the Board approved an updated version of SSE's employee guide which contained enhanced decision-making tools. All Group Policies were reviewed and approved in 2020/21 through the Board's standing annual review.\n\nReflective of cultural drivers around leadership and values, commitments were made in March 2020 not to furlough any employees, with the priority being a longerterm approach to the pandemic through continuity of work. This has remained a stated Board focus, alongside appropriate recognition of employee commitment and achievement. To this end, the Board endorsed flexible remote working policies and an 'SSE Day' of leave for all employees.\n\n## Monitoring indicators of culture\n\nThe Board does not use a singular tool for the assessment of culture; instead drawing upon multiple sources to understand the way employees feel about SSE and how this translates into observed behaviours and trends. These sources can be described as a combination of the below regularly reported metrics, standing reports and listening channels.\n\n- \u00b7 Feedback from all Board-employee engagement.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement programme insights.\n- \u00b7 Employee survey results.\n- \u00b7 Twice yearly Cultural Dashboard review.\n- \u00b7 Monthly people updates from the Chief Executive covering key developments and employee sentiment.\n- \u00b7 A monthly compliance report from the Finance Director.\n- \u00b7 Monthly safety and employee wellbeing data.\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing performance.\n- \u00b7 SSE's Principal Risk 'People and Culture'.\n\n## Board support in 2020/21\n\nThe maturity of the Board's Cultural Dashboard has been furthered in 2020/21, with work undertaken to enhance the linkage of data to accompanying observations. It remains a collective of three parts, with: data from Group HR; information on Group Compliance reviews; and commentary on financial crime and corruption prevention controls. An illustrative view of the Group HR component is set out opposite.\n\nDue to the impact of coronavirus on metrics, the cultural dashboard could not be read comparatively across 2019/20 and 2020/21. Its interpretation was therefore supported by insights from the all-employee surveys, Board engagement and listening events. This allowed consideration of the coronavirus impact and changes in sentiment. Through discussion of the issues raised by employees, the Board approved:\n\n- \u00b7 the continued development of businessled responses to employee survey findings, which the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement would engage on;\n- \u00b7 plans to develop a future ways of working model; and\n- \u00b7 continuation of enhanced communication.\n\nAdditional challenge was provided to ensure listening remained dynamic in style, field staff did not feel isolated from the communication approach and the impact on new entrants and those early on in their careers be considered.",

These tools complement the established annual all-employee survey process and the Board's review of findings.\n\nThe adoption of a diverse range of listening channels has been based on the principle that everyone in SSE should have a voice, and is consistent with employee feedback of the benefit of multiple platforms to raise areas for discussion. In turn, it supports the Board in gathering a fair and representative view of the issues which are important to employees and builds an appreciation of how these may differ by business, role and geography.\n\nEngagements can be classed as formal and informal, with both required to identify ongoing themes and new concerns. Typically, the formal approach is used to gather a structured and holistic view across a large population of individuals at a point in time. With the Board's informal methods providing a greater depth of feedback, truer understanding of underlying sentiment and supporting development of constructive relationships with employees. The size and format of discussions is determined by the stated objective of the Board's engagement.\n\n## Board engagement in 2020/21\n\nThe modified engagement approach adopted during 2020/21 as a result of working arrangements during the coronavirus pandemic, alongside details of what has been heard and the action taken, is set out in page 115 \uf150 . The central feature of the approach has been new technologies and the associated opportunity to conduct conversations on a much larger scale and simultaneously with individuals located across different parts of Great Britain and Ireland. Conversations have continued to be broad ranging and cognisant of, and responsive to, the changing status of the pandemic in the year.",

Dame Sue Bruce was appointed to the role in 2018.\n\nThe Nomination Committee made the above recommendation through consideration of the agreed role profile and in recognition of Sue's depth of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION\n\nEMPLOYEES /endash.case NON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nEngaging with colleagues has looked substantially different in 2020/21, reflecting the challenges that have been faced by society at large. Through its ability to adapt, SSE has enabled continued engagement by 'travelling' across our businesses and geographies with virtual conferencing. Resilience and strength in depth has been evident in every group of colleagues with whom I have had the opportunity to engage.\n\nIn addition to contributing to the listening channels set out on pages 114 to 115 \uf150 , my focused discussions have explored the outcomes of two all-employee surveys, working during lockdown and allowed open Q&As.\n\nAs well as the measured responses to the all-employee surveys, consistent feedback has reflected:\n\n- \u00b7 Loyalty and commitment to SSE and delivering for stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 A pledge to support colleague wellbeing, with a focus on mental health and those living and working alone during lockdown.\n\nexperience, active listening skills and empathetic approach. It was further deemed complementary, that as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, relevant employee perspectives could be understood in the context of wider remuneration policy and the approach to reward.\n\nEach year, the programme of work is structured and supported by SSE's Group HR Employee Engagement Manager. The success of the role is measured in action, whereby the employee voice is consistently represented in meetings attended by the Non-Executive Director for Employee\n\n- \u00b7 Support for a range of communication channels and continued clarity of messaging.\n- \u00b7 The value of ready access to managers and ability to provide feedback.\n- \u00b7 Successful and continued business delivery through responsive IT solutions.\n- \u00b7 The high importance of SSE's inclusive culture especially within recruitment.\n- \u00b7 That focus on safety has remained paramount.\n\nTo keep in touch with a range of views, our virtual meetings have reached colleagues in different business areas and settings. This included attendance at formal business meetings and discussion in more intimate groups without senior leaders. The diversity of these contacts has comprised: frontline coronavirus workers in SSE Enterprise; engineering colleagues in SSEN Distribution; senior leaders in SSE Thermal; teams in Customers; and an Energy Portfolio Management employee survey focus group.\n\nThe engagement programme also incorporates meetings twice annually each with trade unions FTOs and with JNCC colleagues. These seek to give alternative direct access to the Board and support the formal industrial relations activities led by the executive team. This underpins our commitment to openness, inclusivity and transparency whilst respecting and keeping intact our respective roles and responsibilities.\n\nEngagement, allowing the views and opinions of colleagues to feature and contribute to discussions and decisions being made.\n\n'It was great to engage with Sue on our virtual town halls, and hear first-hand about the focus on employee engagement and two-way communication at Board level. I think it's really important people see a genuine appetite from leaders across SSE to incorporate the opinion of employees into their decision making.'\n\n## James Moran,\n\nLow Carbon Thermal Engineer\n\nThe strength of this dedicated role in providing feedback to the Board, and a factor which has come to the fore in 2020/21, is the speed at which views can be heard. This has been invaluable in assessing the adequacy of our employee support in an unprecedented period. The collaborative role of Group HR ensures that responsive business-led action can be channelled directly to senior leaders and informs the overall engagement approach.\n\nI would like to re-iterate the pride felt by the Board for what has been achieved in challenging circumstances, and welcome comments on our engagement agenda. I look forward to the continuation of our programme in 2021/22 and the open, constructive and enjoyable conversations this will entail.\n\n## Dame Sue Bruce\n\nNon-Executive Director for Employee Engagement\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is conducted annually through formal performance evaluation, which considers the work of the Board, its Committees and the individual Directors.\n\nThe 2020/21 performance evaluation was an internal process, facilitated by the Company Secretary in consultation with the Board and Board Committee Chairs.

Non-Executive Directors' insight and experience is welcomed, with the correct balance of work between the Board and its Committees being achieved.\n\nDetails of the full areas of assessment are set out below, alongside commentary and actions for progression in 2021/22.

The Committee sets the framework for the development of an inclusive and high-performing leadership team and workforce now and for the future.\n\nReflecting on the Committee's work at Board-level during 2020/21, a stated focus was identifying a successor to Richard Gillingwater as Chair of the Board. This was a formal and rigorous process which is set out in detail on page 124 \uf150 . Following its completion, I joined the Board as a non-Executive Director on 1 September 2020 and became Board and Nomination Committee Chair on 1 April 2021.\n\nPrior to this, the Board and Committee welcomed Dame Angela Strank on 1 May 2020 following her recommended appointment. On 30 September 2020 and 31 March 2021 respectively, Crawford Gillies and Richard Gillingwater stepped down from their respective roles, and I want to extend our gratitude for their dedicated service to SSE.\n\nI am delighted that Tony Cocker has been appointed to the role of Senior Independent Director in line with Board succession plans, and we have reviewed and updated committee membership in light of the changes to the Board. Related executive talent considerations included the expansion in the role of the Group Energy and Commercial Director, a position which now has greater accountability and oversight of commercial growth opportunities and risk in SSE's marketbased businesses. Through our annual evaluation we further agreed to refresh our non-Executive Director skills matrix such that it fully reflects and aligns with SSE's purpose, vision and strategy. Once complete, it will support our succession planning efforts going forward.\n\nWith 2020 and 2021 set as the target years for the achievement of Hampton-Alexander and Parker Review ambitions, I am pleased that we are in line with the stated recommendations surrounding Board gender and ethnic diversity. To signal our commitment to enduring change, we have taken steps to formalise our Board ethnicity ambition with its inclusion in the Board's Inclusion and Diversity Policy.\n\nThe Board's female representation has increased year on year and now stands at 40%, as we continue to work towards a rolling three-year ambition of 33%. The Composition Dashboard page 121 \uf150 sets out a number of our additional Board diversity indicators.\n\nThe ongoing search for a new nonExecutive Director outlined on page 123 \uf150 will remain cognisant of our ambitions and look to strengthen our diversity of skills, knowledge and personal experiences.\n\nDiscussion surrounding future talent pipelines has reflected on both the current talent pool and the diversity they represent. Since 2017, SSE's inclusion strategy has worked to deliver change in this area and we recognise that further progress is required. In conjunction with senior leadership, we have agreed to increase the Committee's involvement across separate talent and inclusion and diversity workstreams where there are opportunities to provide additional support. Further details are provided page 127 \uf150 and will be a key focus in the year ahead.\n\nI look forward to reporting on further progress as we continue our work across 2021/22.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair of the Nomination Committee 25 May 2021",

        "page_content": "## COMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION CONTINUED NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Nomination Committee provides dedicated focus to the following people-led matters. Where findings from the annual Board evaluation process fall under one of these heads, it will integrate them into relevant considerations and supporting workstreams. The full responsibilities of the Committee are set out in its Terms of Reference which are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Board leadership\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThrough active consideration of SSE's purpose, vision and strategy, the Committee identifies the skills, knowledge and experience required for effective leadership and long-term success. The balance and representation of these competencies across the Board is managed through succession planning, knowledge development and targeted recruitment.\n\n## Talent pipeline\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nThe Committee monitors the talent pipeline for senior leadership and the initiatives to develop internal capability to support succession. It engages in leadership programmes and receives updates on external recruitment.\n\nUnder the Board's Inclusion and Diversity Policy, the Committee considers the range of perspectives and attributes across the Board and senior leadership to ensure they remain appropriate to SSE's strategy and culture. It confirms ambitions to drive progress and challenges areas where further work is required. Holistically, it considers Group-wide inclusion and diversity strategy which embeds SSE's approach to valuing difference.\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe membership of the Committee comprises the non-Executive Directors and the Chair of the Board, who is also Chair of the Nomination Committee. The Company Secretary is Secretary, and where appropriate to do so, the Executive Directors attend meetings. Biographical details of the Committee members can be found on pages 98 to 101 \uf150 .\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe annual evaluation process ( see pages 118 to 119 \uf150 ) confirmed the continued effective operation of the Committee. The questionnaire-led process saw appraisal of the Committee's operations and dynamics, and sought views on each of its agreed focus areas, supporting information flows and oversight.\n\n## Evaluation confirmed\n\n- \u00b7 The membership of the Board and Board Committees delivers an appropriate balance of experience and technical knowledge and is a position which continues to be monitored.\n\n## Actions for 2021/22\n\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive succession. Refresh the existing non-Executive Director skills matrix and review succession plans for those Board members nearing the maximum recommended tenure.\n- \u00b7 Executive succession and talent pipeline. Retain talent and capability as an action and continue to strengthen dialogue and oversight of action plans, including leadership programmes for high-potential candidates.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity. Recommend an increase in the Committee's support and profile surrounding inclusion and diversity ( see page 127 \uf150 ).\n\n## Meeting and focus areas in 2020/21\n\nThe Committee met seven times in 2020/21 with details of meeting attendance on page 102 \uf150 . The work carried out in the year is detailed over the following pages and is structured under each of the Committee's key areas of responsibility.\n\n## Board leadership\n\n## Composition and succession\n\nThe composition of the Board is informed by the Committee's plans for orderly succession within key Board and Committee roles. This is supported by assessment of the required Board skills, experience and diversity in line with agreed strategy and changes in SSE's operating context. The backdrop to these discussions is the components of the Board Composition Dashboard on page 121 \uf150 , which are subject to formal review each year.\n\nSuccession planning and the review of Board composition saw two new nonExecutive Directors join the Board in 2020/21. The appointment of Dame Angela Strank commenced on 1 May 2020 with details of the recruitment process set out in SSE's Annual Report 2020. The work which supported the appointment of Sir John Manzoni from 1 September 2020 is set out on page 124 \uf150 . Following the departure of Richard Gillingwater on 31 March 2021, Sir John Manzoni assumed the position of Board Chair on 1 April 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 Chair succession and appointment has been managed well under the prevailing coronavirus context and associated guidelines and restrictions.\n- \u00b7 Positive progress has been made in relation to talent and capability, and inclusion and diversity, however further opportunities for Committee support should be identified.\n\nThe Committee monitors the size, structure and composition of the Board Committees to ensure they are able to provide the necessary support, and possess the correct expertise to discharge their role now, and going forward, in line with succession plans.",

This was followed by the recommendation, in line with internal succession plans, that Tony Cocker become Senior Independent Director from 1 October 2021.\n\nFollowing Crawford's departure, the Committee considered the requirement for additional Board recruitment to preserve the diversity and breadth of Board and Committee skills and attributes. Spencer Stuart 1 has been engaged to support a prospective search against an initial set of objective criteria, which centre on depth of understanding of Scottish politics and business environments, and strong commercial experience.\n\nAn expanded remit for the Energy Director was further considered and recommended to the Board for approval. From 1 November 2020 Martin Pibworth assumed the role of Group Energy and Commercial Director, through which he now has additional responsibility for: commercial and associated risk management activities for all of SSE's non-networks businesses; SSE Enterprise which comprises distributed energy including solar and storage; and accountability for identifying and delivering on growth opportunities across all of SSE's market businesses.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nThe expected time commitment of the Chair and non-Executive Directors is agreed and set out in writing in the Letter of Appointment to the position, at which point the existing external demands on an individual's time are assessed to confirm their capacity to take on the role. Further appointments which could impair the ability to meet these arrangements can only be accepted following approval of the Board. The taking on of any external appointments by an Executive Director is also subject to Board consent. Changes to key external Board appointments in 2020/21 are set out on page 98 \uf150 .\n\n## Director re-appointment\n\nAll non-Executive Directors undertake a fixed term of three years subject to annual re-election by shareholders. The fixed term can be extended, and consistent with best practice, would not go beyond nine years unless exceptional circumstances were deemed to exist. The Committee considered and recommended a further three-year extension to the tenure of Peter Lynas and Tony Cocker representing a third and second term in each case.\n\nThis decision was supported by the continuing independence, experience and contribution that each Director continues to bring to both the Board and its Committees ( see pages 99 to 100, 118 and below \uf150 ).\n\n## Conflicts of interest and independence\n\nEach Director has a duty to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest situations, as defined by law, for consideration and approval if appropriate by the Board. This requirement is supported by an annual conflicts authorisation process, where the Committee reviews SSE's Conflicts of Interest Register and seeks confirmation from each Director of any changes or updates to their position.\n\nThe above process informs the simultaneous assessment of a nonExecutive Director's independence, as following the absence of any conflict, the Committee reflects upon the outcome of each individual Director's performance evaluation ( see page 118 \uf150 ) and the circumstances set out in the Code which could compromise an individual's position.\n\nFollowing review in 2020/21, and to the exclusion of the interested Director in each case, the Committee recommended and the Board confirmed: updates to the Conflicts of Interest Register; the continuing independence and objective judgement of each non-Executive Director; and the overall independence of the Board in line with the recommendations of the Code.\n\nAdditional safeguards to support Director independence of thought and judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7 Meetings between the Chair and the non-Executive Directors, individually and collectively, without the Executive Directors present. These are used to discuss areas relevant to the operation and performance of the Board and the SSE Group. Two meetings were held in 2020/21 with no areas of concern raised.\n- \u00b7 Separate and clearly defined roles for the Chair, as head of the Board, and the Chief Executive, as head of executive management. This division of responsibility is supported by a degree of contact outside Board meetings to ensure an effective ongoing dialogue and channel for the timely escalation of external or internal developments.\n\n## Knowledge development and training\n\nAny Director can request further information to support the fulfilment of their individual duties or collective Board role. The arrangements are overseen by the Company Secretary and can be internally or externally facilitated, with sessions typically originating from technical Board discussions, an identified training opportunity or area of general interest which relates to the SSE Group. Sessions in 2020/21 included:\n\n- \u00b7 supplementary deep dives and external guest speakers on strategic matters ( see pages 106 and 118 \uf150 ); and\n- \u00b7 virtual one-to-one meetings with senior leaders covering: business priorities; safety culture and performance, including the impact of coronavirus; digital; Group Risk; energy markets; and large capital project governance.\n\nFurther sessions for 2021/22 were agreed through the annual Board evaluation.\n\nThrough SSE's mandatory training programme all Directors are requested to refresh their understanding of current obligations and recent developments in areas pertinent to their role. These modules address, among other matters: the legal duties of a Director; competition law; antimoney laundering and financial sanctions; GDPR; and inclusion and diversity. To remain abreast of, and connected to, broader societal trends, expectations and issues, the Directors are encouraged to participate in seminars and events hosted by external organisations. Discussion with peers, other sectors and individuals in different professional and personal situations develops broader perspectives and insights, which can translate into different thinking styles and new debate within Board discussions.",

A final evaluation which included a benchmarking exercise against the candidate specification, core skills matrix and specific personal qualities which the Committee wished to preserve covered the broader considerations set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting SSE's long-term success. With the Chair instrumental in directing the development and delivery of SSE's strategy; fit and enthusiasm for SSE's purpose and vision and strategy, including its business goals and sustainability ethos was key.\n- \u00b7 Leading the Board and culture. An individual with the ability to create the conditions for overall effectiveness within and outside Board meetings was a priority. This would require constructive relations with Directors and senior leadership, and was considered a prerequisite to promoting a cohesive culture that respects and supports the needs of all employees.\n- \u00b7 Professional experience. In order to support high standards of corporate governance and business ethics, demonstrable experience of working at an appropriate level within a listed business of a similar scale and complexity as SSE was requested.\n- \u00b7 Understanding stakeholders. As a lead ambassador for the Group, strong communication skills to further SSE's approach to stakeholder engagement was mandatory, alongside a commitment to engage personally where appropriate. Complementary to this, was an understanding of how SSE creates financial and non-financial value.\n\nThe Nomination Committee confirmed that Sir John Manzoni possessed the desired capabilities and experience, and would bring sound leadership to the Board and SSE Group. The Board approved the recommendation that he be deemed independent on appointment and take on the role of non-Executive Director from 1 September 2020 prior to becoming Chair of the Board from 1 April 2021.

This was conducted in line with the previously disclosed time limited extension in Chair tenure which would end no later than 31 March 2021. Peter Lynas was nominated as the non-Executive Director to lead the process, with Richard Gillingwater abstaining from involvement to preserve the objectivity of considerations.\n\nThe Nomination Committee managed the search as set out below and provided standing updates to all independent Board members at each stage.",

        "page_content": "## Director induction\n\nFollowing appointment, all Directors receive a comprehensive and tailored induction programme. This is designed through discussion with the Chair and the Company Secretary and considers existing expertise and any prospective Board or Board Committee roles.\n\n## Sir John Manzoni\n\nDue to the nature of the Chair role and the restrictions placed on physical meetings, the substantive programme agreed for Sir John Manzoni was initially phased over six months and delivered virtually. When safe to do so, a plan for physical meetings and operational site visits will be put in place.\n\nThe formal element of the programme comprised the engagements set out below. These were structured to provide the information needed to engage in Board meetings upon appointment and then\n\nfurther develop the oversight required as Chair thereafter. Informal follow-up sessions were arranged where requested, in order to connect with and get to know senior leaders including their management areas and current focus. Time was also spent with Richard Gillingwater as part of the role transition to gain additional perspectives from his time as Chair.\n\n## Dame Angela Strank\n\nThroughout 2020/21, Dame Angela Strank continued to engage in the induction programme set out in the Annual Report 2020.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe composition of SSE's Board Committees is designed around the following principles: to ensure alignment between skillset and specific Committee responsibilities; to prevent undue reliance on the capacity of any Director; and to\n\ncomply with recognised guidance including the Code. Changes are recommended following directorate appointments and succession, or in response to formal review.\n\nIn the year, the Board approved recommendations resulting in the below changes.\n\n- \u00b7 Sir John Manzoni joined the Nomination Committee as of 1 September 2020; the Remuneration Committee and SHEAC from 1 October 2020; and the EMRC on 1 April 2021.

Talent development is an area which has continued to progress following the implementation of SSE's seven Business Units, whereby an increase in the number of senior roles has supported broader development of critical leadership skills. The latest position was considered through annual review of the progression plans and contingency arrangements for: the Executive Directors; the Group Executive Committee; and MD-level positions.\n\nIn line with SSE's strategy and the review of changes in the operating context, a suite of new capabilities has been further identified and prioritised. Options for developing these include mobilisation of the current talent pool and external recruitment. This builds upon the work which has seen external hires fulfil a significant proportion of senior roles in the last 12 months. Through constructive discussion of the anticipated investment and timeline for continued delivery of capability, a formal\n\nplan to allow reporting and measuring of progress is under development for Committee review.\n\nCommittee oversight of the engagement in, and impact of, core talent programmes has continued, despite the inability to attend supporting events in person following a necessary move to a virtual training environment. Notwithstanding, engagement with future leaders has been facilitated virtually through presentations at Board meetings, and business-led sessions and conferences which the Directors have attended. The open twoway dialogue between the Board and all levels of the organisation is seen as a key tool for observing and informally coaching emerging talent. See pages 114 to 116 \uf150 for the approach to employee engagement.\n\nAs the UK and Ireland look to move out of the coronavirus pandemic, consideration is being given to the ways in which SSE can continue to build on its flexible working approach and retain and attract talent. Specific focus will be provided to performance enablement and the tools required under any agreed future ways of working scenario.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nSSE's Group-wide approach to inclusion and diversity is explained across pages 49 to 50 \uf150 , with the role of the Committee being to confirm the adequacy of plans, targets and progress, and to consider insights and findings from the initiatives which are in place.\n\n## Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy\n\nThe Board operates under a standalone inclusion and diversity policy, the objective of which is to ensure that Board membership remains appropriately balanced and relevant to SSE's purpose, strategy and values. As highlighted below, it sets out measures that the Committee and Board will take in order to achieve this. During the year, the Committee reviewed and confirmed the Policy's ongoing application within the context of its work. The Policy can be viewed in full on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy measures, implementation and progress\n\nPolicy measures\n\nImplementation and progress\n\n| Identify the needs of the Board and its  Committees, and in doing so consider the  balance of: skills; knowledge; perspectives;  experience; gender; ethnicity; and length   of membership.   | See page 122  \uf150  Composition and succession and  page 124 \uf150  Appointment of Chair of  pools.

        "page_content": "## Ambitions and initiatives\n\nBoard ambitions. The Board has agreed ambitions surrounding its own gender and ethnicity which are used to monitor progress and inform the Committee's approach to succession planning and Board appointments. These are to maintain a level of female membership of at least 33% over a rolling three year period and to have at least one Board member who represents an ethnic minority. It is recognised that ambitions are sensitive to changes in both the size and composition of the Board, and the Committee's aim is to maintain an enduring position which drives change and achieves a Board that remains balanced over time. The diversity of the Board is set out on page 121 \uf150 .\n\n## Senior leadership ambitions. The\n\nCommittee supports the HamptonAlexander recommendations to improve gender diversity across the Group Executive Committee and its direct reports. Aligning with SSE's strategy centred on accountable Business Units, and to allow clearer tracking of diversity within the talent pipeline, further self-led ambitions supplement this position. These measures look at the diversity of the Group Executive Committee and its subCommittees and the gender split of roles earning in excess of \u00a370k. Progress against these ambitions and the gender split of senior leadership is reported on page 49 \uf150 .\n\nSupporting initiatives. Comprehensive updates in the year covered the evolution of SSE's inclusion and diversity approach and the factors influencing the choice of targeted initiatives. Diversity scorecards detailed the split of diversity criteria including gender, ethnicity and disability within recruitment processes for apprentices through to senior leaders, and also across the overall employee, new entrant and leaver populations. This was accompanied by completion rates of training interventions and employee feedback on inclusion. Full details of the underlying strategic approach and progress are set out on pages 49 to 50 \uf150 .\n\n## BOARD PRINCIPAL DECISION FOCUS ON INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY\n\nBackground\n\nBoard and Nomination Committee discussion\n\nBoard and Nomination Committee stakeholder considerations and impacts\n\n## Outcome, next steps and related decisions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Nomination Committee provides focus to the workstreams which form part of an enduring strategy to be more inclusive to difference and in turn increase diversity across the Group. Further consideration was given in 2020/21 as to how the Nomination Committee and Board could further promote and support progress in this area, including across the identified talent pipelines.\n\nThe targeted action needed to increase gender, ethnic minority and disability workforce representation in the energy sector is well understood by the Nomination Committee and senior leadership. However limitations exist to understanding the true picture and therefore also the ability to report transparently surrounding progress, with a contributor being the need for diversity data to be provided voluntarily by individuals due to its protected characteristic. Employee sentiment is easier to read and inclusive practices and behaviours can nonetheless be embedded. Through the annual evaluation process and a review of diversity progress, the Nomination Committee expressed a want for increased involvement in reinforcing the prime importance of inclusion and diversity to SSE, and its commitment to enact change.\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting employees. Providing an inclusive and diverse workplace is a material issue to employees and the Board strives to ensure that appropriate actions are in place to deliver equal opportunities and a fair working environment for everyone in SSE.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable practices. A diverse workforce means there is breadth of difference, a matter that supports SSE's ability to better reflect the customers it serves and the stakeholders it depends on to achieve its business objectives. This includes its 2030 business goal based on providing decent work and providing economic growth.\n- \u00b7 A just transition. The energy transition provides an opportunity to actively deliver a diverse mix of people from every kind of background working in the sector, and supports development of an inclusive working environment where they can thrive. This greater diversity, at all levels, is key to forming the pathway to net zero, with different views bringing broader debate, improved decisions and ultimately better business.\n\nThe Board confirmed that the profile of, and focus provided by the Nomination Committee to people matters should be raised. This was to ensure the cultural importance of inclusion and diversity was apparent to and understood by colleagues and prospective new entrants. A supporting plan setting out current and future priority areas would be developed by Group HR, with opportunities for Board and Nomination Committee support identified.\n\nStrategic link:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLink to Principal Risk: People and culture\n\nSee also:\n\nPages 49 to 50 \uf150 .",

This report is intended to provide shareholders with an insight into key areas considered, together with how the Audit Committee has discharged its responsibilities and provided assurance on the integrity of the 2020/21 Annual Report and Financial Statements.\n\nThe coronavirus created an abrupt shift to working from home with almost all within Finance having now worked from home for over a year. The same has been true for\n\nmany organisations, including our External Auditor, EY. This has meant that the financial reporting and audit process has had to adapt. Last year we decided to defer the Full-Year Results announcement by one month to give the Finance teams and the External Auditor adequate time to ensure that a robust audit process was delivered. Following completion of the audit for 2019/20 and using the feedback obtained from the review of the effectiveness of external audit process, EY held a series of de-brief sessions with senior Finance management across the Group to agree a package of measures to enhance the working relationship and drive efficiency in the audit process. At its meeting in September, the Committee assessed the potential impact of the pandemic on the financial reporting and audit timetable for 2020/21 and agreed to build a further week into the process for both the half year review and full year audit to help mitigate potential delivery delays. I received regular updates from the Finance Director and the Lead Audit Partner to ensure progress was tracking to plan and issues were being dealt with in a timely manner. I'm pleased to report that a robust audit process has again been delivered remotely.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee was briefed on the status of regulatory change so as to assess the likely impact this may have on the future work of the Audit Committee and to enable areas of focus to be planned accordingly. In anticipation of significant change, the Committee stood up a project team in 2020 to assess the anticipated introduction of a UK SOX style framework for the financial reporting control environment.\n\nPlanning to ensure SSE is prepared for the output of the audit and corporate governance consultation and developing an assurance framework for reporting on climate related risks and opportunities will be key areas of focus for the year ahead.\n\nI hope that you find this Report informative and take assurance from the work undertaken by the Committee during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Lynas Chair of the Audit Committee 25 May 2021\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee's role is to support the Board in relation to the responsibilities set out below. The Committee's Terms of Reference are regularly reviewed and updated as required and are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Financial reporting\n\n## External audit\n\n- \u00b7 Review the integrity of the interim and annual Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Review the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices.\n- \u00b7 Review the significant financial judgements and estimates considered in relation to the Financial Statements, including how each was addressed.\n- \u00b7 Review the content of the Annual Report and Accounts and advise the Board on whether taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## Internal audit\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 Review and approve the Internal Audit Plan and monitor its implementation.\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, including the adequacy of the overall Internal Audit resource.\n\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the management of risk and overall System of Internal Control.\n- \u00b7 Review the framework and analysis to support both the Going Concern and the long-term Viability Statement.\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor, including the policy to govern the provision of Non-Audit Services.\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the external audit process and the ongoing relationship with the External Auditor.\n- \u00b7 Review and make recommendations to the Board on the tendering of the external audit contract, and the appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement of the External Auditor.",

        "page_content": "## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe composition of the Committee is compliant with the Code and currently comprises three independent nonExecutive Directors as Committee members. Crawford Gillies stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2020 and ceased to be a member of the Audit Committee. Peter Lynas has chaired the Committee since 2014 and is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. He was Group Finance Director of BAE Systems plc until 31 March\n\n2020 and is a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The Board considers the Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector, with two members having had significant executive roles in the energy sector, and all members possessing an appropriate level of experience in corporate financial matters. Biographical details of the Audit Committee members can be found on pages 98 to 101 \uf150 and details of meeting attendance are set out on page 102 \uf150 .\n\nThe Committee meetings are routinely attended by: the Chair of the Board; the Finance Director; the Director of Group Risk and Audit; Partners from the External Auditor; and the Deputy Company Secretary (who is Secretary to the Committee). The Committee also invites other senior finance and business managers to attend certain meetings to gain a deeper level of insight on particular items of business. The Committee meets with the External Auditor privately at least twice each year in line with the financial reporting calendar and also with the Director of Group Risk and Audit.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe actions identified from the evaluation of the Audit Committee in 2019/20 covering the level of resource in SSE's Finance teams, the working relationship with External Auditor and culture temperature checks of the risk management and internal control at Business Unit level were monitored through to completion. The evaluation of the Audit Committee during 2020/21 was facilitated by an internally-led questionnaire, in addition to a self-assessment against best practice which was carried out by the Chair and Committee Secretary. The output of both the evaluation and self-assessment was considered at the Committee meeting in February 2021, and an update was provided to the next Board meeting. The Board confirmed the effective operation of the Audit Committee in discharging its responsibilities.\n\n## Evaluation themes in 2020/21\n\n## Actions to progress during\n\n## 2021/22\n\n- \u00b7 Meetings have been held virtually during the year as a result of the coronavirus restrictions and they continued to be effectively chaired with a good level of challenge and debate on the key issues.\n- \u00b7 The relationship between the Audit Committee and Internal Audit, Group Risk, Finance and Company Secretarial was recognised as being open and constructive. In response to feedback from the previous evaluation, the bench strength in Finance and Internal Audit has improved during the year with two senior appointments, both of whom regularly attend Committee meetings.\n- \u00b7 The actions from the post audit de-brief sessions held between the External Auditor and management has helped to enhance the efficiency of the audit process and strengthen the audit relationship.\n- \u00b7 The External Auditor have continued to provide fresh perspective and rigorous challenge to the management team and the deliberations of the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Whilst the membership of the Committee remains compliant with the Code, a recommendation was made to the Nomination Committee and Board to consider the appointment of a new member of the Audit Committee with recent and relevant financial/accounting experience following the departure of Crawford Gillies.\n- \u00b7 Other members of the Finance team will be invited to attend certain future meetings to give the Committee greater visibility on talent and succession.\n- \u00b7 In the absence of physical meetings, a debrief session will be scheduled following any future virtually held Committee meetings to provide a further opportunity for the members to share reflections.\n- \u00b7 The Committee requested a review of the overall assurance model covering audit, compliance and assurance and would consider the development of an Audit and Assurance Policy.\n\n## Meetings and focus areas in 2020/21\n\nThe Committee met on five occasions during the year and has met once since the end of the financial year. All meetings were held virtually in advance of the Board meeting to allow the Committee Chair to provide a report on the key matters discussed and consider any recommendations. A forward plan of agenda items informs the business considered at each meeting and is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect areas identified for additional focus. The practice of effective governance and quality reporting underpin all aspects of the work of the Committee.\n\nIn addition to the scheduled meetings, the Committee Chair meets separately with the Finance Director, Director of Group Risk and Audit and the External Auditor to ensure the work of the Committee is focused on key and emerging issues. Before each meeting, the Committee Chair meets with the Finance Director and External Auditor to ensure there is a shared understanding of the key issues to be discussed.\n\nAn additional meeting in June 2020 was held primarily to consider the Preliminary Results following SSE's decision to move the publication date from 20 May 2020 to 17 June 2020. The decision to change the publication date followed a review of the practical impacts on the audit process as a\n\nresult of the coronavirus pandemic. The Committee, in consultation with the External Auditor, concluded in line with FCA guidance that it would take longer to prepare and audit SSE's Financial Statements for 2019/20 and that postponement to the publication date was in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders.\n\nThe Committee considered the coronavirus impact on the half year review to 30 September 2020 and audit for the full year to 31 March 2021. In consultation with both management and the External Auditor, the Committee agreed to include an extra week in the half year and full year timetable to reflect the change to working practices and to ensure there was sufficient time for the audit process to be completed.",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL CONTINUED AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts seek to provide the information necessary to enable an assessment of SSE's position and performance, business model and strategy. In preparing the Financial Statements for 2021 there are several areas requiring the exercise of judgement or a high degree of estimation. Throughout the year, the Finance team worked closely with the External Auditor to ensure SSE provides the required level of disclosure, including the appropriateness of alternative performance measures (APMs) and their consistency with IFRS financial information. This section outlines the significant areas of judgement that have been considered by the Committee - through discussion and detailed reporting by both management and the External Auditor - to ensure appropriate rigour has been applied. Other key accounting judgements and areas of estimation uncertainty applied in the preparation of the Financial Statements for 2021 are provided in Notes 4.2 and 4.3. The Independent Auditor's Report on pages 296 to 306 \uf150 sets out the audit approach\n\nand highlights the other key audit matters that EY drew to the attention of the Audit Committee. These areas of audit focus include: going concern; decommissioning provisions; provisions and claims; customer debtor recoverability; carrying value of tangible and intangible assets; depreciation policy; taxation judgements; recovery of the \u00a3100m OVO loan note; exceptional items; and APMs.\n\n## Significant financial judgements and estimates\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements. In consultation with the External Auditor, the Committee reviewed the significant financial judgement areas and identified four specific areas for 2021/22. Whilst the overall number of significant financial judgement areas remained consistent with the prior year, accounting for the impacts of coronavirus was no longer considered by the\n\nSignificant financial judgements and estimates for the year ended 31 March 2021\n\nHow those were addressed by the Audit Committee\n\n## Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets (Estimation Uncertainty)\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets to determine whether any impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded. The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2021 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to thermal power generation. In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit (CGU) at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs. Changes to the estimates and assumptions arising from factors such as regulation, legislation, power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's income statement and balance sheet.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations (Estimation Uncertainty)\n\nThe assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the period are based on the Group's best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.\n\nAn annual valuation/impairment exercise is carried out and the basis and outcome of this review is presented to the Committee by management and includes a description of the assumptions applied in deriving the recoverable values. The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions and projections presented in the management paper and considered the detailed reporting from, and findings by, the External Auditor. Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment charges and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at Note 15. Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1. Following this review, the Committee supported the recommendation to recognise an impairment of \u00a358.1m in the financial year in relation to the Great Island CCGT plant in Ireland.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the Group's defined benefit retirement schemes are regularly reviewed. Advice is taken from independent actuaries on the IAS 19R valuation of the schemes. The Committee was updated on the schemes' valuation and considered the findings of the External Auditor in relation to the scheme's key assumptions relative to market practice. Following this review, the Committee supported the judgements made. Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the resulting movements in obligations and the sensitivity of key assumptions to the obligation is disclosed at Note 23.\n\nCommittee to be a significant financial judgement with the impact on the Group's adjusted operating profit in the year outturning at the lower end of the anticipated range. Due to the individual and collective materiality of the \u00a32bn disposal programme announced during the year and the potential complexity of these transactions, the Committee agreed to include the accounting for the SSE disposal programme as a significant financial judgement.\n\nThe Group's most significant financial judgement areas, some of which are also areas of estimation uncertainty, are explained below. For each of these areas the Committee considered the key facts and judgements outlined by management. The Committee specifically discussed with the External Auditor how management's judgement and assertions were challenged and how professional scepticism was demonstrated during their audit of these areas. This also included the adequacy of the disclosures within the Financial Statements for each matter presented in the table below.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue recognition - Customers unbilled supply of energy (Estimation uncertainty)\n\nRevenue from energy supply activities undertaken by the Business Energy and Airtricity businesses includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This estimation comprises both billed revenue (disclosed as trade receivables) and unbilled revenue (disclosed as accrued income) and is calculated based on applying the tariffs and contract rates applicable to customers against estimated customer consumption and taking account of various factors including usage patterns, weather trends and externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies. A change in the assumptions underpinning the calculation would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period.\n\n## Accounting for SSE disposal programme (Accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nSSE announced a \u00a32bn disposal programme during the year. Due to both the collective and individual materiality of the planned disposals, there is a significant risk around the accounting for the complexity of these transactions. In particular, complexity arises in the final negotiated deal around the terms of the share and purchase agreements, non-cash consideration elements and transitional services arrangements.\n\n## Going Concern and Viability Statement\n\nThe Committee reviewed the information to support the assessment and disclosure of the going concern statetment prior to Board approval (see A6.3 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements). Given the cash surplus of \u00a31.6bn at 31 March 2021; the undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a31.5bn maintained by the Group; the current commercial paper market conditions; and the assumption the Group will be able to refinance maturing debt, the Directors have concluded that both the Group and SSE plc as Parent Company have sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have considered sensitivities on future cashflow projections resulting from the coronavirus pandemic; the Group's credit rating; the success of the Group's disposal programme through 2020/21; and the successful\n\nThis estimation is subject to a process which compares calculated unbilled volumes to a theoretical 'perfect billing' benchmark measure of unbilled volumes (in GWh and millions of therms) derived from historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and aggregated metering data used in industry reconciliation processes. Furthermore, actual meter readings and billings continue to be compared to unbilled estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of the Financial Statements. The Committee reviewed the practical process issues and assumptions applied in determining the estimation uncertainty and considered the findings of the External Auditor. Following this review, the Committee supported the estimate for revenue recognition from energy supply activities. Further details of the sensitivity associated with this judgement is disclosed at Note 18.\n\nThe risk focused on the accounting treatment of six disposals completed by 31 March 2021 and also covered the assessment of businesses being classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date. The Committee were briefed on the audit procedures performed in relation to each transaction, all of which had been executed in line with the External Audit Plan. The Committee challenged both management and the External Auditor on the accounting treatment for the disposals and sought assurance that they had been appropriately addressed and disclosed. Following consideration, the Committee supported the exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3976.0m and a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3246.5m. Further details of the disposals and held for sale assets are disclosed at Note 12.\n\nissuance of \u00a32.5bn of medium to long term debt and Hybrid equity during the year. In the very unlikely event of not being able to access the revolving credit facility or otherwise refinance as may be required, the Group's options include not calling the \u00a31.0bn Hybrid debt instruments due in September 2022, deferring uncommitted capex and implementing further cost reductions. The Financial Statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe Committee agreed the parameters and reviewed the supporting report for the Board's assessment of the prospects of the Company which is covered in the Viability Statement on page 56 \uf150 . In doing so, the Committee considered the potential impacts arising from coronavirus and reviewed the period covered by the Viability Statement and remains of the view that a three-year period is the most appropriate timespan.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable assurance framework\n\nThe assurance framework used in the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 to assist the Directors in the discharge of their requirement to state that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a verification process dealing with the factual content;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive reviews undertaken independently by senior management to consider messaging and balance;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive reviews undertaken by the Company's Brokers to ensure consistency and balance;\n- \u00b7 reporting by the External Auditor of any material inconsistencies; and\n- \u00b7 comprehensive review by the Directors and the senior management team.\n\nThe Committee and Board received confirmation from management that the assurance framework had been adhered to for the preparation of the Annual Report 2021.",

During the year, Hywel Ball became the Senior Advisory Partner for the SSE plc audit and Annie Graham, supporting partner in the prior year, became the lead audit partner assuming responsibility for signing the SSE plc Audit Opinion on behalf of EY. Annie Graham leads the engagement team and has been in post since EY were appointed and will be required to rotate after five years. The external audit contract will be put out to tender at least every 10 years. As such, the external audit tender will be conducted by no later than 2029 and any future tenders will be carried out in line with prevailing best practice. The Committee confirms ongoing compliance with the Statutory Audit Services Order.\n\nThe FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR) team completed a review of the EY audit of the Financial Statements of SSE plc for the year ended 31 March 2020. The report from the FRC set out the scope of the review, the assessment of the quality of the audit work reviewed, any key findings, and examples\n\nof good practice. The Committee reviewed the contents of the inspection report and provided positive feedback to the External Auditor on delivery of the first-year audit which had been largely carried out remotely under coronavirus restrictions.\n\n## External Auditor and audit process effectiveness\n\nAn important part of the Committee's work consists of overseeing the Group's relationship with the External Auditor to ensure the independence, quality, rigour and challenge of the external audit process is maintained. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the audit throughout the year taking into account:\n\n- \u00b7 the detailed audit strategy for the year and coverage of the highlighted risks, scope, and level of fees for the audit;\n- \u00b7 the quality, knowledge and expertise of the engagement team;\n- \u00b7 insight around the key accounting and audit judgements and the competence with which the External Auditor has applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in dealing with management; and\n- \u00b7 the outcome of the review of effectiveness of the External Auditor and audit process discussed below.\n\nThe Committee enhanced the arrangements for the review of the effectiveness of the External Auditor and the audit process in the previous year and has adopted an integrated framework in the current year to help provide assurance that a high-quality audit has been performed. The key elements set out below were delivered individually and were considered collectively in the Committee's review of effectiveness. The importance of management engagement in the external audit process is recognised and the practice of briefing management on their obligations in relation to the provision of information to the External Auditor has continued.\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nIn addition to the annual review of effectiveness, the Committee considered the independence and objectivity of the External Auditor through: a combination of assurances provided by the External Auditor on the safeguards in place to maintain independence; oversight of the Non-Audit Services Policy and fees paid; and oversight of SSE's policy on employing former auditors. The External Auditor confirmed that all its partners and staff complied with their ethics and independence policies and procedures including that none of its employees working on the audit hold any shares in SSE plc.\n\n## Feedback to inform the review of the effectiveness of External Auditor and audit process\n\n## External\n\n- \u00b7 Assurance from EY covering the matters raised in the FRC's Annual Quality Review inspection reports and remedial actions (if any) taken by the audit firm.\n\n## Management\n\n- \u00b7 Assess output from survey of those subject to the external audit process.\n- \u00b7 Assurance on the disclosure process for the provision of information to the auditors has been adhered to.\n\n## External Auditor\n\n- \u00b7 Assess delivery of the audit strategy and Independent Auditors' Report.\n- \u00b7 Assess output from survey of Audit Partners on the external audit process.\n- \u00b7 Assurance on the operation of audit quality process at audit firm.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 Assess output from annual Audit Committee evaluation.\n- \u00b7 Assess output from survey of Audit Committee members, regular attendees and Group Finance.\n\n## Outcome\n\nFollowing consideration of all elements of the audit effectiveness review process, in addition to taking account of the engagement and communication between the Audit Committee, management and External Auditor, the Committee confirmed it was satisfied that the external audit process provided by EY had been delivered effectively. The Committee requested that debrief sessions be held between the External Auditor and finance management team to consider any areas to enhance the audit process control environment going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Non-Audit Services Policy\n\nThe process for approving certain NonAudit Services provided by the External Auditor is governed by the Non-Audit Services Policy which is overseen by the Committee. The Policy was reviewed by the Committee and updated during the year to ensure that it remained fit for purpose and aligned to the FRC's whitelist of Permitted Audit-Related and Non-Audit Services. Any Audit-Related Service or Non-Audit Service which is not on the list can not be provided by the External Auditor. In addition, SSE is required to cap the level of non-audit fees paid to its External Auditor at 70% of the average audit fees paid in the previous three consecutive financial years. Services provided by the External Auditor are split into two categories for the purposes of approval:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit-Related Services. These services are largely carried out by members of the audit engagement team. The work involved is closely related to the work performed in the audit and the threats to auditor independence are 'clearly insignificant'. Such engagements are routinely pre-approved by the Audit Committee as part of their approval of the total annual audit fee. Before engaging in any work of this type, approval is required from the Finance Director.\n\n2018/19 AUDITOR FEES /parenleft.casePAID TO KPMG/parenright.case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Audit and Audit-Related Services - \u00a31.4m (56%)\n- Permitted Non-Audit Services - \u00a31.1m (44%)\n- Audit and Audit-Related Services - \u00a31.9m (86%) Permitted Non-Audit Services - \u00a30.28m (14%)\n- \u00b7 Non-Audit Services. These are services other than 'Audit-Related Services' for which the External Auditor is an appropriate provider. The threats to independence arising from such services are not necessarily 'clearly insignificant' and the Committee and External Auditor must consider the threats to independence and whether any safeguards should be applied. In the absence of any apparent threat to auditor independence, approval for the provision of any Non-Audit Service must be obtained from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the use of the External Auditor for whitelist Non-Audit Services subject to the following limits: The Finance Director up to \u00a350,000 and Audit Committee Chair up to \u00a3100,000.\n\n## External Auditor fees\n\nThe Committee keeps under review the services provided by the External Auditor by reviewing a report at each meeting. Fees for Audit and Audit-Related Services incurred during the year amounted to \u00a32.5m and \u00a30.2m for Non-Audit Services. Audit fees in the current year include scope changes and overruns of \u00a30.4m related to the prior year audit which arose due to coronavirus and the first year\n\n2019/20 AUDITOR FEES /parenleft.casePAID TO EY/parenright.case\n\ntransition to EY. Fees paid to EY during the year are made in Note 6 to the Financial Statements. Non-Audit Services principally related to regulatory accounts and returns required by Ofgem and comfort letters in connection with funding and debt issuance. The Committee was satisfied that the work was best handled by the External Auditor because of its knowledge of the Group and the services provided did not give rise to threats to independence. All Non-Audit Services were approved in accordance with the Non-Audit Services Policy and adhere to the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\n## Re-appointment of the External Auditor\n\nThe Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor, and that the effectiveness of the external audit process delivered by EY was robust.

During the year, SSE's Director of Group Risk, Audit and Insurance retired. Following a recruitment process led jointly between the Audit Committee Chair and Finance Director, the position of Director of Group Risk and Audit was filled with an experienced external appointment which has brought a fresh perspective to the work on the Internal Audit and Group Risk functions. In addition to the normal corporate reporting structure, the Director of Group Risk and Audit has the right of direct access to the Chief Executive, the Committee and the Company Chair. At each Committee meeting, an update on Internal Audit is provided covering an overview of the work undertaken in the period, actions arising from audits conducted, the tracking of remedial actions, and progress against the Internal Audit Plan. The Committee routinely meet independently with the Director of Group Risk and Audit to discuss the results of the audits performed and any additional insights obtained on the risk management and control environment across the organisation.\n\n## Internal Audit Plan\n\nThe Internal Audit Plan is structured to align with SSE's operating model, risk profile, control environment and assurance arrangements. An integrated assurance mapping and planning process is undertaken to ensure that Internal Audit work is appropriately aligned to, and coordinated with, the activities of other relevant assurance providers across the Group. The Plan includes audits of key transformational programmes, financial control and areas relating to responsible behaviour and non-financial risk. During the year, the full Internal Audit programme was briefly paused to allow the organisation to focus on its initial coronavirus response. The Committee adjusted the full Plan to ensure that priority areas received adequate focus. During the year, the Committee has supported the development of a three year plan of activity to provide an indicative view of future Internal Audit focus. In recognition of Internal Audit's responsibility to retain agility to appropriately recognise organisational change and related changes in SSE's risk profile, the three year Internal Audit plans will remain subject to ongoing review and revision.\n\n## Internal Audit effectiveness\n\nThe Committee keeps under review and assesses the independence and effectiveness of Internal Audit by adopting the process outlined below.\n\nThe assessment considered Internal Audit's positioning within the organisation and the quality of its planning and operational procedures. The assessment incorporated a survey of Internal Audit's stakeholders across the Group, along with a review of outputs from a number of recent internal audits. During the year, the Committee also considered SSE's current Internal Audit arrangements against the guidelines set out in the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' Internal Audit Code of Practice. Following consideration, no significant changes were made to the Internal Audit arrangements. A follow-up review of the Internal Audit function is being carried out by the recently appointed Director of Group Risk and Audit and the findings will be evaluated by the Committee in the year ahead.\n\n## Internal control and risk management Internal control\n\nThe Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of SSE's System of Internal Control. This covers all material controls including financial and compliance controls, in addition to the financial reporting process. Internal control and risk management in relation to SSE's energy market related exposures are overseen by the Energy Markets Risk Committee and further information can be found on pages 138 to 139 \uf150 .\n\n## Feedback to inform the review of the effectiveness of Internal Audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing consideration of all elements of the review, the Committee recognised the progress made during the year, and confirmed it was satisfied with the overall performance of the Internal Audit function. The key areas of focus for 2021/22 included: reviewing the resource and skills requirement of the function; refreshing the audit methodology; and developing the use of technology for analytics and audit management.",

These evaluations are assessed by the Finance Director and a letter is provided to the Committee summarising the work conducted in the year to improve the control environment and making a recommendation on the overall effectiveness of the System of Internal Control. In addition, when undertaking the review of the effectiveness of the System of Internal Control, the Committee considers the assurance evaluations undertaken annually by the Managing Directors of each of SSE's seven Business Units. These assurance evaluations consider 10 key management\n\n## System of Internal Control\n\nThe elements that make up the System of Internal Control are:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance Framework. Designed to ensure focus on the key components of high quality and effective decision making - clarity, accountability, transparency and efficiency. For further details please see page 102 \uf150 of the Directors' Report.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Framework. This includes Group's strategic objectives, financial objective and sustainability goals and forms the basis for all activity within the\n\ncontrol areas and include any planned improvements to enhance controls. These improvements are tracked, with updates reported to the executive-level Group Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's Risk Management Framework is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can only therefore provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. In addition to the ongoing review of emerging risks, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the Principal Risks facing the Group, being those that have the potential to threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Further details of the Group Principal Risks are set out on pages 54 to 63 \uf150 .\n\n## Internal control and risk management effectiveness\n\nAn investigation into an incident of external fraud against SSE Renewables that was discovered in April 2020 concluded that\n\nRisk Management Framework. For further details please see pages 8 to 13 \uf150 of the Strategic Report.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Management Framework . This framework supports each Business Unit in managing its risks and helps to ensure that the Board can meet its obligations. The framework is underpinned by the fundamental principle that everyone at SSE is responsible for the management of risk.\n- \u00b7 Assurance Framework.

This report intends to provide an overview of how we operate, give an insight into our activities, and outline the role we play to oversee SSE's energy markets risk exposures and ensure the effectiveness of its risk management controls and related processes relevant to energy market risks.\n\nIn alignment with SSE's approach to hedging, our main responsibility is to oversee governance arrangements, which provide transparency of SSE's approach to managing commodity price exposures. Reports of these exposures are reviewed and discussed at each EMRC meeting, and when required, actions will be recommended to the Board for approval of any changes to SSE's hedging approach.\n\nDuring the year, we have continued to monitor and oversee these exposures, with the following examples of hedging related activities reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 In response to the market turbulence triggered by the first coronavirus pandemic national lock down in March 2020, SSE Renewables elected to suspend its hedging activity in line with policy to avoid the highly volatile market activity caused by falling demand. The circa twomonth suspension avoided coronavirus related impacts on future wholesale market prices; and\n- \u00b7 In November, in response to the uncertainty of long-term carbon pricing due to the UK's exit from the European Union, SSE Thermal temporarily adjusted\n\nits approach to forward hedging of its thermal generation output for periods beyond March 2021.\n\nAs a committee, we will continue to monitor SSE's management of commodity price exposures and, should circumstances lead to any change in approach being required, these will be fully discussed, challenged and appropriately reported. Details of SSE's latest hedging approach and hedging position at 31 March 2021 are set out on page 71 \uf150 or can be found on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic, we received regular updates on its energy market related impacts and monitored the developments of its economic consequences. For example, to allow us to monitor the impact to the Customers Business Unit, we reviewed regular reports and received the minutes from the Grouplevel Demand Management Committee (set up to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on the Customer Business Unit demand profile).\n\nFurthermore, to maintain awareness and oversight of emerging energy market risks and other areas within the EMRC's remit, a dynamic agenda is operated. Each meeting is used to consider a range of recurring items as well as other items that are more ad hoc and/or forward-looking in nature. These have included:\n\n- \u00b7 reviews of emerging energy market risks;\n- \u00b7 conducting relevant deep-dive sessions; and\n- \u00b7 reviews of risk management and internal controls concerning energy markets.\n\nThese focus areas, along with the reports on energy market exposures, allowed us to have visibility of current material issues and provided a strong foundation for debate and challenge regarding SSE's energy market exposures and related assurance activities.\n\nIn line with our commitment to good governance and continual improvement, the EMRC's performance was assessed as part of the annual Board evaluation during the year. Despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the ability to have physical meetings, I am pleased to confirm through the performance evaluation that the EMRC has continued to operate\n\n## SSE's approach to hedging\n\nSSE has committed to delivering a transparent approach to how it manages commodity price exposures.\n\nCentral to this transparency is SSE's established hedging approach, through which it generally seeks to reduce its broad exposure to commodity price variation in relation to electricity generation and supply at least 12 months in advance of delivery.\n\nAs market conditions change, SSE may require to vary its hedging approach to take account of any resultant new or additional exposures. SSE will continue to provide a summary of its current hedging approach, including details of any changes in the period, within its Interim and Full-Year Results Statements which can be found on sse.com \uf295 .\n\neffectively, by providing an open forum that allows the appropriate level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit.\n\nLooking ahead, the main priority for the EMRC in 2021/22 is to continue our oversight role on SSE's energy markets risks and exposures. Particularly, given the ever-changing external environment, we will focus on the impact, management and mitigation of relevant macroeconomic and geopolitical events. This will include the influence on SSE's energy market exposures relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic;\n- \u00b7 the regulatory landscape; and\n- \u00b7 the UK's exit from the European Union, particularly in relation to a mechanism for the long-term carbon pricing.\n\nI hope that you find this report informative and representative of the activities undertaken by the EMRC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTony Cocker Chair of the EMRC 25 May 2021",

The results of the evaluation indicated that the EMRC is operating effectively, and continues to provide an appropriate level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. No specific actions were identified.\n\n## Meetings and focus areas in 2020/21\n\nThe EMRC held four meetings during the year and reports to the Board on its work following each meeting. Each meeting agenda is informed by a forward plan of business, which is designed to ensure that the EMRC carries out its responsibilities in line with its Terms of Reference. In addition to the scheduled meetings, the EMRC Chair meets with the Group Energy and Commercial Director, Managing Director of Energy Portfolio Management, and the Committee Secretary to review papers in advance of the meeting and ensure that key and emerging issues are brought to the EMRC's attention as appropriate.\n\nThe EMRC will continue to develop and to regularly review the forward plan of business to accommodate any emerging issues and risks to the Group concerning energy markets.\n\nDetails of the key focus areas and action taken by the EMRC in the year are set out in the table below.",

The report explains the work of the SHEAC during the year, the Company's response to coronavirus and the significant progress that has been made in relation to safety, health and the environment. A more in-depth review of these areas, together with a range of other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting can be found on pages 32 to 53 \uf150 and in our Sustainability Report available from sse.com \uf295 .\n\nOur Safety Family licence, 'If it's not safe, we don't do it' is at the very heart of our safety culture and part of our DNA. Over the years, the work we've done on safety, health and the environment has put us in a very strong position to deal with the unprecedented challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic. The burden on people and society has been overwhelming with daily life disrupted beyond recognition. Despite this, I've been humbled by the resilience, commitment and dedication of our employees who have worked to provide a safe and reliable supply of electricity that is critical in enabling the national response to the pandemic. On behalf of the SHEAC, I would like to thank all employees and those that work for SSE for your sustained effort and hard-work. From operatives in the field to office-based staff now working remotely, the shift in working arrangements has been sudden and significant. As the pandemic continues to threaten health, much uncertainty remains in the months\n\nand years ahead. A key focus for the SHEAC going forward will be to help navigate the Group as it recalibrates its working arrangements to a new sustainable normal.\n\nSSE's strategy is to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero. In practical terms, this strategy sees us operate in a hazardous industry ranging from working at height on the high-voltage electricity transmission network in the North of Scotland to the installation of offshore wind turbines in the North Sea. Above all, the safety, health and wellbeing of the people that work for SSE directly or on its behalf is the Company's first and foremost priority. We have a responsibility to make sure everyone gets home safe and promote a culture where all employees are empowered to do the right thing. As a SHEAC, we must provide leadership, support and challenge to ensure the evolving safety, health and environmental risks are understood and appropriately mitigated. During the year, safety, health and environmental performance has continued to be strong, and we remain restless to achieve better. Our sustained focus on this will be at the heart of SHEAC activities in the year ahead.\n\nOn the environmental side, SSE has a proud history of developing low-carbon infrastructure from the hydro power revolution in the 1940s, to building some of the world's biggest offshore wind farms and electricity networks to support net zero today. SSE is a Principal Partner to the UK Government on COP26 and is committed to helping drive climate action. In May 2020, SSE published its greenprint for a cleaner, more resilient recovery from the economic impact of coronavirus. The five-point action plan was submitted to the UK Government to meet the twin objectives of helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus whilst taking climate action to meet net zero targets. To support ongoing engagement with shareholders on climate-related issues, we have proposed an enabling resolution, within the business of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2021, that establishes a framework for an annual advisory vote on SSE's Net Zero Transition report at future AGMs.\n\nThe above represents just some of the key focus areas for the SHEAC in 2021/22.\n\nThe output from the performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees identified a need to evolve the scope and coverage of the SHEAC in 2021/22 to assist the Board in its oversight of sustainability governance and assurance on a range of ESG topics. In support of this, the Board agreed a series of recommendations at its meeting in May 2021 to enhance the role of the renamed Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee on the governance and assurance of a range of ESG matters.\n\nFinally, Melanie Smith stood down from the Committee as a member on 31 March 2021. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank Melanie for her valuable contribution and insight to the work of the Committee\n\nI hope that you find the following report a useful explanation of our work and of SHE performance during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelen Mahy CBE Chair of the SHEAC 25 May 2021",

        "page_content": "## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee's role is to support the Board and provide assurance in matters relating to safety, health, environment (SHE) and sustainability. The SHEAC provides a leadership forum for non-Executive Directors to work with senior management and shape policy, targets and strategy to improve SHE performance and culture, in addition to supporting SSE's commitment to being a sustainable company that makes a positive contribution. The SHEAC reviews and oversees four significant Group policies: Safety and Health Policy; Climate Change Policy; Environment Policy; and Sustainability Policy. The SHEAC Terms of Reference are regularly updated and are available on sse.com \uf295 . Following the\n\nperformance evaluation of the SHEAC (see below), further updates to the Terms of Reference will be made to include additional responsibilities covering a range of ESG matters.\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe membership of the SHEAC comprises three non-Executive Directors; the Chair of the Board; the Chief Sustainability Officer; the Managing Director, SSEN Distribution; the Managing Director, SSE Renewables; the Managing Director, SSE Enterprise Utilities; and the Director of Group Safety, Health and Environment. The Deputy Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee and the Chief Executive\n\nroutinely attends meetings. The Committee invites operational managers and specialists to attend certain meetings to gain a deeper level of insight on particular items of business. Biographical details of the non-Executive members can be found on pages 98 to 101 \uf150 and details of non-Executive meeting attendance are set out on page 102 \uf150 . During the year, a number of changes to the Board and executive membership of the Committee were considered by the Nomination Committee and subsequently agreed by the Board. The detail of these changes are set out on page 125 \uf150 .\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe evaluation of SHEAC during 2020/21 was facilitated by an internally-led questionnaire. The output of the evaluation, together with insights from discussions held between the Chair Designate and Committee Chair on the scope and coverage of the SHEAC, were considered at its meeting in March 2021. Following this, the Board confirmed the SHEAC continued to effectively discharge its responsibilities and endorsed the recommendation to recalibrate the coverage of the SHEAC on certain ESG matters and the sustainability agenda. The key themes and actions for 2021/22 are summarised below.\n\n## Evaluation themes\n\n- \u00b7 The knowledge and experience of the SHEAC membership is broad and each member is able to bring a different and valuable perspective.\n\n## Actions for 2021/22\n\n- \u00b7 Whilst the virtual site visits worked well in the circumstances, physical site visits are invaluable and help bring the SHE-culture to life, particularly for the non-Executive members of the SHEAC.\n- \u00b7 A significant number of individuals from all levels of the Group were able to attend SHEAC meetings and their insight was highly valued.\n- \u00b7 With the significant increase in focus on ESG matters in recent years, a detailed review to clarify the governance and oversight arrangements for ESG topics will be carried out to improve the overall cohesion and coordination of ESG matters between the Board, Board Committees and management.\n- \u00b7 The SHEAC's Terms of Reference and plan of agenda items will be updated in line with the outcome of the review described above.\n- \u00b7 The programme of site visits will be resumed when safe to do so and in line with government restrictions.\n\n## Meetings and focus areas in 2020/21\n\nThe SHEAC met four times in 2020/21. Working closely with the Group Safety, Health and Environment Committee (which reports into the Group Executive Committee), the SHEAC has an annual work plan to: review SHE performance at Group-level and in each of SSE's seven business areas; consider in-depth reviews of certain key topics such as contractor and process safety; and review a range of SHE governance and assurance requirements. The comprehensive programme of site visits which routinely complement the formal SHEAC meetings were unable to take place this year as a result of the coronavirus restrictions. A series of virtual site visits for member of the SHEAC to engage with management on the work being delivered across the Group in relation to the environment, contractor safety, occupational health and wellbeing and the\n\nSafety Family programme were arranged in September 2020. A large part of the meeting in October 2020 was dedicated to receiving feedback from the virtual site visits and agreeing next steps in the process of continual improvement.\n\n## Response to coronavirus\n\nSSE's over-riding priority through the coronavirus pandemic has been to provide the safe and reliable supply of electricity, at local, regional and national level, on which the people and organisations whose work is critical to the coronavirus response depends. SSE published a statement which sets out the support provided to customers, employees, suppliers and contractors and communities. SSE also joined forces with a host of businesses and signed the C-19 Business Pledge to support the UK through the coronavirus pandemic and the recovery efforts. Further details are available at sse.com/coronavirus \uf295 .\n\nSSE's business continuity framework was deployed in early 2020 and has been used to manage the Group's response to the coronavirus pandemic. An update on the evolving position, including key and emerging issues is presented to each meeting of the SHEAC and is also considered at each Board meeting. To ensure people across the Group continue to work safely, a range of new processes, procedures and guidance have been established and have been widely communicated. Having invested significantly in the technology for agile working in recent years, everyone who could work from home has done so in line with government restrictions. For those employees who were unable to work remotely as their attendance on site was critical to continued operations, PPE, hygiene and social distancing measures were established to ensure safe working conditions were maintained.",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL CONTINUED SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED\n\nAt an early stage, SSE introduced coronavirus testing when needed for its critical workers and has worked closely with trade unions partners throughout to extend flexible working practices, particularly for those with caring responsibilities. SSE has not used the UK Government Job Retention Scheme.\n\nDuring the year, SSE has sought the views of employees in the Group's response to the coronavirus, emotional wellbeing and postlockdown working practices. The results of the surveys have provided invaluable insight that is being used to inform how SSE plans future ways of working.\n\n## SHE performance Safety\n\nBuilding on the commitment to use clear and simple language for engaging with employees on SHE performance, the SHEAC endorsed the concept of 'Safe Days' as a new way to monitor and track its safety progress and performance. On a 'Safe Day', there are no minor, serious or major SSE or contractor safety or environmental incidents or any incident with high potential for harm to people or the environment. During 2020/21, 271 Safe Days were achieved, compared to 247 in the previous year. In addition to Safe Days, SSE continues to measure safety performance using the rolling Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) for employees and contractors. This measure is used for benchmarking and trend analysis and in 2020/21 it fell to 0.15 per 100,000 hours worked, compared to 0.16 in the previous year. Despite the improving trend in SHE performance the Committee remains mindful that incidents and accidents still occur. The focus on ensuring everyone gets home safe remains central to everyone in SSE and the work of the SHEAC.\n\n## Health and wellbeing\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic presents challenges for employees around maintaining good mental health in times of uncertainty and social distancing. Building on the progress and measures implemented to enhance the awareness of mental health issues, SSE has used its partnership with Nuffield Health to give employees access to a range of resources to help take care of themselves while at home, including an emotional care guide, advice from physiotherapists and free access to the 'My Wellbeing' app which provides home workout videos and tailored programmes. SSE's Back to Health programme supported by Nuffield Health is available to all employees in Great Britain. The programme has helped line managers start\n\nconversations with colleagues who they were concerned for, by having the ability to offer Nuffield Health as support for stress, anxiety, depression and musculoskeletal conditions. Employees also have the option to self-refer. SSE's priority for 2021/22 will be to continue to support employees adapt to new working conditions and look after their mental and physical health. A followup review of the plans being implemented across the business to assist with fatigue management has also been scheduled for the year ahead.\n\n## Environment\n\nSSE seeks to actively manage its environmental footprint, whilst maximising positive and minimising negative impacts. The environmental strategy is designed to drive progress and has been developed around three priority areas covering climate action, responsible consumption and production and the natural environment.\n\nThe strategy provides a framework for each business area in the Group to develop their own environmental plan with its implementation supported by policies, procedures and targets to guide interactions with the environment. During the year, the SHEAC received presentations on the work being undertaken across the Group covering matters such as net zero, biodiversity, climate adaptation, greenhouse gas emissions and waste management.\n\nIn the year ahead, the world will gather in Glasgow this November for the United Nations Climate Change conference. SSE is proud to be a Principal Partner on COP26 and is supporting efforts to a agree a more ambitious global climate deal committing countries to action. SSE is playing its part to make net zero emissions a reality through a range of activities, including building the largest offshore wind farm in the world, developing the first hydro pump storage project in over 30 years, pioneering carbon capture and storage technologies, investing in the transmission network for net zero and laying the distribution infrastructure for the electrification of transport and heat. Further details of these projects are included in the Strategic Report.\n\nIn 2020/21, the number of environment incidents as a result of SSE's activities totalled 44 compared to 53 in the previous year. Of these, there were no major environmental incidents. SSE's environmental permit breaches decreased to four in 2020/21 from 10 the previous year. Both the number of breaches and the severity decreased, with the majority\n\nrelating to minor environmental incidents. Most breaches were self-reported to the relevant environmental agencies and all incidents were dealt with quickly when identified. During the year, SSE's carbon footprint benefited by having reduced travel, with most colleagues predominantly working from home for the last year.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSSE's approach to the disclosure of its sustainability impacts seeks to bring about continuous improvement in both the quality of information disclosed and the stakeholder engagement that results. It is understood that stakeholder scrutiny is a powerful agent for performance improvement and, therefore, SSE seeks to work with stakeholders and shareholders to understand their needs.\n\nSSE's Sustainability Report aims to demonstrate the way SSE creates value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way and provides detailed information on the policies, practices, performance and governance of a range of economic, social and environmental matters. The SHEAC oversees the development of the Sustainability Report which is available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 . Complementary information can also be found in pages 32 to 53 \uf150 .\n\nThe UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprint for addressing global challenges, including climate change, and therefore SSE's four 2030 business goals are aligned to the SDGs most material to the Group. The Sustainability Report also details progress against the four 2020 business goals.\n\nRecognising the increasing significance of a company's ESG performance, the SHEAC will adapt in financial year 2021/22 to encompass further scrutiny and oversight of particular ESG topics, identified as being material.\n\n## More information\n\nA sustainable approach: pages 32 to 53 \uf150",

This has been achieved because of the steps taken early in the pandemic to establish safe ways of working for employees who have been unable to work from home. This has limited the impact of lockdowns on SSE's day-today operations and construction activity. Most office-based employees continue to work from home. The wellbeing (both mental and physical) of all SSE's employees, contractors and agency workers has been a key consideration for us over the last year. Some of the actions taken by the Group are set out on page 45 \uf150 .\n\nDespite the challenges presented by coronavirus, the business has demonstrated its resilience and made good progress in terms of its strategic delivery. Our five-year, \u00a37.5bn investment and capital expenditure plan has progressed well. The Group has also made strong progress towards its \u00a32bn disposals programme over the year. This further simplifies and streamlines our business model. SSE is resolutely focused on a net zero world and our leadership and advocacy is demonstrated by our COP26 partnership and Race to Zero campaign which are explained in more detail on pages 24 and 36 \uf150 .\n\nAt the same time, SSE has delivered solid operational performance and strong strategic execution which has created value for all our stakeholders. The resilience and strength of the Group is demonstrated by our ability to deliver our dividend plan. We have not accessed any of the UK Government's programmes to support businesses. SSE engaged with trade unions to agree measures to prevent the need to furlough employees, consistent with its long-term commitment of being a responsible employer. The business created hundreds of new jobs during the period. SSE also announced in May a payment to all employees of \u00a3400/\u20ac450 as a thank you for their contribution during the pandemic. Being able to achieve this in the current environment is testament to the hard work of our team and the leadership demonstrated by our executives.\n\n## Linking remuneration with SSE's purpose and strategy\n\nOur current Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, with over 99% support. The policy is built on our core reward principles which endure even though the business model continues to evolve. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability, reinforcing SSE's commitment to being a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 Simplicity, maximising transparency and avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n- \u00b7 Stewardship, encouraging good decision-making for the long term.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholders, reflecting SSE's goal of creating value for shareholders and society.\n\nOur Directors' Remuneration Policy is designed to be sustainable and simple and to facilitate diligent and effective stewardship that is vital to achieving SSE's core purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow, and delivering on our strategy.\n\nSustainability is at the heart of our business and is reflected in the four fundamental business goals we have set for 2030 (explained in more detail in the Sustainability Report \uf223 ) which are linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThey are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Cut our carbon intensity by 60%.\n- \u00b7 Treble renewable energy output.\n- \u00b7 Help accommodate 10m electric vehicles.\n- \u00b7 Champion Fair Tax and a real Living Wage.\n\nProgress against these SDGs is a key component of our strategy and we reward performance against them through the Annual Incentive Plan. We will be assessing the possibility of measuring SDG progress as part of the long-term incentive arrangement before our policy review in 2022. SSE's 2030 business goals are important interim milestones on the road to net zero in 2050. The 2030 goals and progress made against them in 2020/21 are set out in more detail on pages 14, 15 and 22, 23 \uf150 .\n\nFairness is a central pillar of the policy - fairness to Executive Directors in recognition of the extent of their responsibilities, and fairness relative to the rest of the SSE team whose shared talent, skills and values are essential to SSE's success and have been evidenced more than ever in the last year. The extent of their responsibilities means Executive Directors are well paid, but the remuneration policy is designed, among other things, to ensure they are not overpaid.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is regularly informed of pay and employment conditions throughout the Company. I am also the designated Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement and during the year was able to virtually contact a wide range of employees (and their representatives) to listen to their thoughts on business matters including executive pay. On page 147 \uf150 we have provided a snapshot of pay more generally throughout the Company and how this links into the matters we consider when deciding on executive remuneration.\n\nThe Board takes time to consider the interests of stakeholders in all its decision making ( see pages 28 to 31 \uf150 . It has taken a particularly balanced and thoughtful approach in respect of all the remuneration decisions regarding Directors this year.",

        "page_content": "## Annual Incentive Plan\n\nPayments under the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) are determined against a broad range of financial, operational, strategic and personal performance targets collectively designed to reflect business performance each year. The measures used for 2020/21 were chosen to support our strategic delivery and longerterm goals, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. When setting the relevant target ranges the Committee reserved discretion to exercise its judgement after year-end once the true impact of coronavirus was understood, with the intention that this would mean reducing the AIP outcome in line with any reduction in earnings.\n\nPerformance in the year has been strong which resulted in the overall assessment of the 2020/21 award being 74% of the maximum. In view of the reduction in earnings, as a result of coronavirus, the Committee, considered it appropriate to reduce the adjusted EPS component formulaic outcome by 18.5% in line with the coronavirus-related impact on budget, believing that this results in a fair overall outcome for the Executive Directors at 69%. This will be the third time in the last five years that the Committee has used discretion in relation to the AIP outcome. A detailed AIP scorecard can be seen on pages 150 to 153 \uf150 .\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nThe Executive Directors are the only three participants in the Performance Share Plan. The Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards granted in 2018 are due to vest following the 2020/21 financial year, subject to financial, operational and value-creation performance measures over the threeyear period. These have been objectively assessed, resulting in an outturn of 28% of the maximum opportunity. More details on the performance measures used, the targets set, and the actual performance assessed is set out on page 153 \uf150 .\n\nThe Committee confirmed that the formulaic outcome for these awards should stand. The performance targets were stretching when originally set and became even more challenging given the impact of coronavirus, so no adjustment is required.\n\n## Board changes\n\nAs announced on 15 October 2020, Martin Pibworth's role was expanded and he became the Group Energy and Commercial Director. At the time I engaged with our major shareholders and explained the changes we had made to his remuneration as a result. From 1 November 2020 Martin assumed Groupwide responsibility for all commercial and associated risk management activities for all the non-networks businesses. In addition to his previous responsibilities for\n\nSSE Renewables, SSE Thermal, EPMI and Energy Customer Solutions, he now leads SSE distributed energy including solar and storage as part of SSE Enterprise. He is also accountable for identifying opportunities for and driving growth across all of SSE's non-networks businesses. In short, he now leads a key growth engine of the Group and the importance of his extended role is therefore significant.\n\nThe expansion of Martin Pibworth's responsibilities do not lead to a fundamental change of his role but rather to a considerable increase in accountability which warranted an increase in his base salary of 19% from \u00a3529,000 to \u00a3630,000. This is 69% of the Chief Executive's salary. We decided not to phase the salary increase on the basis that it is not our usual practice to do so in SEE on promotion. We expect subsequent increases to be line with typical increases. The Committee is acutely aware that this is a significant increase when compared to average SSE pay increases and across the economy generally. We took the view that Martin's new remuneration package is a longer-term investment in SSE's future and is also fair and reasonable in light of his considerable additional responsibilities. This follows his strong contribution to the Group over many years including the success of developing the off-shore wind portfolio, and the value created by the recent sale of Multifuel Energy and takes into account the Board's plan for talent management and succession planning.\n\nAs part of the review, the Committee also looked afresh at the phased reduction of Martin's pension allowance over five years (as set out in last year's Directors' Remuneration Report) and concluded the transition process should be accelerated by two years. This means that his pension allowance will be in line with the employer contribution for the majority of SSE's employees taking into account length of service of 15% of salary by 1 April 2023. In taking this decision, the Remuneration Committee took into account the 'flow through' effects of the increase to other elements of Martin's pay and was satisfied that his new level of total remuneration is not excessive. The Committee was also sensitive to the fact that Martin only last year agreed to a reduction in his contractual pension entitlement. It took the view that bringing forward the reduction by two years struck the best balance between shareholders' interests and Martin's own position. Martin's incentive arrangements are unchanged.\n\nOn 1 April 2021, Sir John Manzoni succeeded Richard Gillingwater as Chair of the SSE Board. His fee on appointment is the same as that of his predecessor, recognising his wealth of experience in the energy industry and the expected time commitments of the role.\n\n## Implementation for 2021/22\n\nThe Committee reviewed Executive Directors' base salaries and concluded that in light of continued strong performance and leadership throughout the year, an increase of 1% was awarded which is in line with the average base pay increase across the Group's employees with effect from 1 April 2021.\n\nThe structure and quantum of the AIP remain unchanged. Performance measures are targeted on the delivery of our strategic objectives and in particular our SDGs are designed to tackle climate change and support global goals for sustainable development. The measures and weightings for 2021/22 are set out on page 150 \uf150 .\n\nThere are no changes planned to the structure, quantum or performance measures for 2021/22 in relation to PSP. The performance measures, weightings and targets are set out on page 150 \uf150 .\n\n## Policy review ahead of 2022 AGM\n\nThe current Directors' Remuneration Policy will expire at the end of its normal threeyear life at next year's AGM. The Committee will spend time this year reviewing the policy and deciding if any changes are required to better support the Group strategy.\n\nAs part of the review, the Committee will consider developments in market practice, corporate governance and changes within our own business. One area for consideration will be the current difference in long-term incentive approach between the Executive Directors who participate in the PSP and the next tiers of management who currently participate in the Leadership Share Plan which has features which are more similar to those of a deferred bonus or a restricted share plan. I look forward to engaging with our major shareholders and their representatives to understand their views on any potential changes in approach.\n\n## Summary\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to apply our core principles with transparency in both decision-making and reporting and to do so in a way that is fully cognisant of the perspectives of SSE's stakeholders. In line with that, I welcome any feedback or comments on remuneration matters and can be reached via our Company Secretary, Sally Fairbairn, at sally.fairbairn@sse.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dame Sue Bruce DBE\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 25 May 2021",

The salaries shown above are reported before any such adjustments are made.\n- 2 Benefits relate to company car, Share Incentive Plan company contributions and medical benefits. These benefits are non-pensionable.\n- 3 The pension values for Alistair Phillips-Davies and Gregor Alexander represent the increase in capital value of pension accrued over one-year times a multiple of 20 (net of CPI and Directors' contributions) in line with statutory reporting requirements.\n- 4 The AIP figures above show the value of the award including the portion deferred as shares.\n- 5 The PSP figures for 2019/20 have been readjusted in line with statutory reporting requirements, following last year's report to show the actual value upon vesting. The estimated value shown in the table for 2020/21 is based on the average share price in the three months to 31 March 2021 of \u00a314.495p, as required by the reporting regulations. The award remains subject to service until May 2021 and so the prior year comparative will be restated in next year's report to show the actual value on vesting, as is required by the regulations. There was no share price appreciation.\n- 6 Directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.\n- 7 Martin Pibworth was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2017 and therefore, was not granted an award under the 2017 PSP which vested in 2020. Instead, he received an award under the below-Board long-term incentive plan of \u00a3400,915.\n\n## Rationale for 2020/21 single total figure of remuneration\n\nThere has been a year-on-year increase in the single total figure of remuneration. For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, remuneration has increased by 27% and 30% respectively. This change is attributable to an increase in base salary aligned to the wider workforce, an increase in AIP outcome following a year of strong financial and strategic performance. For the Chief Executive and the Finance Director there is also an increase in the pension service cost which is a function of the valuation regulations rather than any change in approach.\n\nFrom 1 November 2021, the Energy Director took on the expanded role of Energy and Commercial Director. At this time, he received a base salary increase commensurate with his new responsibilities. His AIP award (as percentage of salary) remained unchanged and was based on his base salary earned across the financial year. This year is also the first year that a grant under the PSP has reached maturity following his appointment as an Executive Director during 2017/18. He had previously participated in a below-Board long term incentive which has up to this point been disclosed as a footnote to the table. The resultant year-on year increase is 49%.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the total single figure of remuneration for each Executive Director is appropriate.\n\n## Base salary\n\nIn line with the average base salary increase for the wider employee population, Executive Directors' salaries were increased on 1 April 2020 by 2.75% from \u00a3890,293 to \u00a3914,776 for the Chief Executive, from \u00a3688,124 to \u00a3707,047 for the Finance Director and from \u00a3515,000 to \u00a3529,163 for the Energy Director. In addition, the Energy Director's salary was further increased to \u00a3630,000 on 1 November 2020 when his role was expanded to become Energy and Commercial Director.\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similar sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Company. Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening. The Executive Directors also participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.\n\n## Pension\n\nThe Chief Executive and Finance Director are members of the Southern Electric Pension Scheme and the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme respectively, and their plan membership predates their Board appointments. They participate in the same defined benefit pension arrangements that were available to all employees recruited at that time. The schemes were closed in 1999 and the service costs range from 32.5% to 37.5% of salary. These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.",

        "page_content": "In relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap (which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements) the Company provides top-up (unfunded) arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned had they not been subject to the salary cap. From 1 April 2017 pensionable earnings increases were capped at RPI +1%. These are legacy arrangements and would not be used for any new external appointments.\n\nThe Chief Executive and Finance Director, in common with all other employees who joined at the same time (24 and 30 years ago respectively), have the following pension provisions relating to leaving the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid;\n- \u00b7 in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years' service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50;\n- \u00b7 and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension on an unreduced basis.\n\nDependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committee's policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit (UURB) pension at the time of leaving. Any cash commutation will limit SSE's liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and will be calculated on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.\n\nThe Energy and Commercial Director, who has been with SSE since 1998, was already in receipt of a pension allowance of 30% of salary prior to his appointment as an Executive Director. While the arrangement was consistent with the approach used for all other members who have elected to receive a cash allowance in lieu of accruing future pension benefits, the Committee agreed that his future pension arrangements would be aligned with the wider workforce at 15% of salary on a phased basis over five years. Following confirmation of his expanded role from 1 November 2020, it was agreed that the phased reduction would be accelerated by two years. This means that his pension allowance will be in line with the employer contribution for the majority of SSE's employees taking into account length of service of 15% of salary by 1 April 2023.\n\nThe table below details pension accrued for each of the Executive Directors as at 31 March 2021 and 2020.\n\n|                          |   Accrued pension  as at 31 March  2021  \u00a3000s |   Accrued pension  as at 31 March  2020  \u00a3000s |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies |                                            489 |                                            457 |\n| Gregor Alexander         |                                            443 |                                            418 |\n| Martin Pibworth  1       |                                              0 |                                              0 |",

Set performance measures aligned with strategy\n\nAIP requires broad performance across a number of financial metrics (Adjusted EPS, DPS Growth and Cashflow) and strategic metrics (Personal, Stakeholders and Sustainable Development Goals). These reflect a review of performance measures in 2019/20 which resulted in some strategic measures being updated to reflect SSE's evolving business. The Stakeholders and Sustainable Development Goals performance measures replaced the former Customer and Teamwork measures. The performance measures and their weightings are shown below.\n\n|                     | Financial  (50%)   | Financial  (50%)   | Personal  (15%)              |                | Stakeholders (15%)   |                        | (20%)                  | Sustainable Development Goals          |                              |\n|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Adjusted  EPS (30%) | Cashflow (10%)     | DPS (10%)          | Individual  Objectives (15%) | Customers (5%) | Employees (5%)       | Carbon  Intensity (5%) | Renewable  Output (5%) | Elective  Vehicle  Infrastructure (5%) | Fair Tax &  Living Wage (5%) |\n\n## 2. Set stretching performance targets\n\nThe financial performance targets were set at the start of the financial year taking into account internal financial plans, external consensus where it exists and the expected impact of identified opportunities and threats to the business in the context of wider economic conditions. The performance target range is set on a realistic basis but requires true outperformance for Executive Directors to achieve the maximum. The Remuneration Committee has a history of setting challenging targets, evidenced by the average AIP payout of 48% since 2012 as shown on page 157 \uf150 .\n\n## 3.

The Committee is dedicated to providing as much retrospective detail of the measures as possible, setting out clearly the decision-making process and the levels of attainment achieved, but mindful that any information which could be considered commercially sensitive cannot be disclosed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4.

Take account of wider environment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that the range of measures used in the AIP ensures that performance is assessed using a balanced approach, without undue focus on a single metric which could be achieved at the expense of wider initiatives. When reviewing outcomes the Committee considered performance against the full range of individual objectives and, after considering the strong teamwork displayed, agreed that the same outturn for all was appropriate. AIP outturns for the wider employee population were also taken into account by the Committee. In addition, they also considered the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has been enduring throughout the year, and its effect on stakeholders.\n\n## 5. Apply discretion if required\n\nIn last year's Remuneration Report, it was explained that the 'Committee intends to exercise judgement at year-end once the true impact of coronavirus is understood, to reduce the AIP opportunity in line with any reduction in earnings'. With this in mind, the Committee agreed to make a downward adjustment to the adjusted EPS component outcome of the plan in line with the coronavirus related impact on budget. The budget impact is a reduction of 18.5% which reduces the adjusted EPS out-turn from 25% to 20%, leading to a revised overall AIP outturn of 69% of maximum.\n\nAIP earned for each of the Executive Directors is shown in the table below. The total award is made up of 67% cash and 33% which is deferred into shares for three years which are then retained until two years after stepping down from the Board.\n\nMaximum\n\n|                           | (% of salary)   | AIP earned 1   | AIP cash   | AIP deferred   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|----------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies  | 150%            | 946,793        | 643,351    | 312,442        |\n| Gregor Alexander          | 130%            | 634,221        | 424,928    | 209,293        |\n| Martin Pibworth/thinspace | 130%            | 512,347        | 343,272    | 169,074        |\n\n## 2018 - 2021 Performance Share Plan\n\n## 1.

Assess performance\n\nThe vesting of shares under the PSP is subject to the performance measures and targets shown in the table below which also details the actual outturn for the 2018 PSP award vesting this year.\n\nPerformance measure\n\n| PSP                  | TSR v FTSE 100                         | TSR v MSCI Europe                      | EPS growth                                     | DPS growth                                           | Customer (Distribution)                               | Customer  (Business Energy)                           | Total   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Link to  strategy    | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders      | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders      | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders              | Simple  Sustainable  Stakeholders                    | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders                     | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders                     |         |\n| Rationale            | Relative  measure of  performance      | Relative   measure of  performance     | Underlying  measure  of financial  performance | Return on  investment  through payment  of dividends | Meeting  customers needs  is at core of our  business | Meeting  customers needs  is at core of our  business |         |\n| Weighting            | 20%                                    | 20%                                    | 20%                                            | 20%                                                  | 10%                                                   | 10%                                                   |         |\n| Threshold            | 50th percentile                        | 50th percentile                        | RPI                                            | RPI                                                  | Median ranking                                        | Median ranking                                        |         |\n| Max                  | 75th percentile                        | 75th percentile                        | RPI +10%                                       | RPI +5%                                              | Rank 1                                                | Rank 1                                                |         |\n| Outcome              | Rank 22 of 94 (above 75th  percentile) | Rank 12 of 22 (below 50th  percentile) | Below RPI                                      | Below RPI                                            | Below median                                          | Average Rank 3   of 15                                |         |\n| Performance 100%     |                                        | 0                                      | 0                                              | 0                                                    | 0%                                                    | 83%                                                   |         |\n| Outturn   (% of max) | 20%                                    | 0                                      | 0                                              | 0                                                    | 0%                                                    | 8%                                                    | 28%     |",

Take account of wider environment\n\nSSE's TSR has performed at the maximum level relative to the FTSE 100, and performance in relation to Business Energy customer service ranking is also above median. Conversely, the threshold level was not met for TSR performance relative to the MSCI European Utilities Index. While SSE's dividend commitment has been met over the three-year period, threshold performance at RPI has not been achieved following the resetting of the dividend policy.\n\nWhile the PSP applies to Executive Directors only, the Committee is mindful of the outturns of the long-term incentive arrangement which applies to senior managers. On average, the below-Board incentive award has paid out at a higher level than the PSP outturn.\n\n## 5. Apply discretion if required\n\nThe Committee believes that the formulaic outcome is a fair reflection of wider performance over this three-year period.\n\nThe table below shows the maximum number of shares available, the dividends accrued over the three-year performance period, the total number of shares vesting based on the performance outturn and the estimated value of these shares.\n\n|                          | Awards available  (% of salary)   | Awards available  (number of  shares)   | Additional  awards in  respect of  accrued  dividends   | Total number of  shares vesting   | Estimated  value of awards  vesting 1   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies | 200%                              | 132,287                                 | 31,826                                                  | 45,952                            | \u00a3666,069                                |\n| Gregor Alexander         | 175%                              | 89,466                                  | 21,523                                                  | 31,077                            | \u00a3450,460                                |\n| Martin Pibworth          | 175%                              | 66,957                                  | 16,108                                                  | 23,258                            | \u00a3337,128                                |\n\n## Other remuneration disclosures\n\nFees paid to non-Executive Directors during 2020/21 were as follows:\n\n|                          | Fees \u00a3000s   | Fees \u00a3000s   |\n|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-Executive Directors  | 2020/21      | 2019/20      |\n| Dame Sue Bruce           | 100          | 98           |\n| Tony Cocker 1            | 95           | 84           |\n| Crawford Gillies 2       | 45           | 88           |\n| Richard Gillingwater CBE | 400          | 389          |\n| Peter Lynas              | 90           | 88           |\n| Helen Mahy CBE           | 86           | 84           |\n| Sir John Manzoni 3       | 42           | 0            |\n| Melanie Smith            | 72           | 70           |\n| Dame Angela Strank 4     | 66           | 0            |\n| Total                    | 996          | 900          |",

For a number of years, a Chief Executive pay ratio has been disclosed voluntarily. In 2018/19, the methodology was revised to meet the new reporting requirements. The methodology used is a hybrid approach combining Gender Pay Gap data (as disclosed in the Sustainability Report \uf223 ) with additional elements of pay which are important components of SSE employees' pay such as overtime, employer's contribution to pension and excluding salary sacrifice arrangements. This is believed to allow the most appropriate and consistent comparison.\n\nAs shown in the table below, the pay ratio has increased from 59:1 at median in 2019/20 to 71:1 in 2020/21. While the median remuneration for all employees has increased by 3.4%, the Chief Executive's remuneration has increased by 26.6%. This is due mainly to increased variable pay for the Chief Executive following a strong performance year and the formulaic increase in pension value from a pay freeze in 2019.\n\nSSE's is committed to being a responsible employer, and the remuneration policy is designed with fairness in mind - fairness to Executive Directors in recognition of the extent of their responsibilities and, fairness relative to the rest of the SSE team. More information on SSE's responsible employer ethos can be found within the Sustainability Report \uf223 which includes information on the commitment to being a real Living Wage employer, and other initiatives which help to ensure value is created and retained for employees and the organisation.",

In addition, \u00a3123 was made in dividend payments to shareholders for every \u00a31 spent on Executive Directors' earnings.\n\n## 3. Governance\n\n## External appointments\n\nExecutive Directors are able to accept a non-Executive appointment outside the Company with the consent of the Board, as such appointments can enhance their experience and value to the Company. Any fees received are retained by the Director. Gregor Alexander was a non-Executive Director of Stagecoach Group plc during 2020 and received \u00a358,000 in fees. Gregor Alexander is also Chairman of Scotia Gas Networks but receives no additional fees for this.\n\n## Payments for loss of office and payments to past Directors\n\nThere were no payments for loss of office or to former Directors during the year.\n\n## Advice to the Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Chief Executive, the Director of Human Resources and Head of Reward advised the Committee on certain remuneration matters for the Executive Directors and senior executives although they were not present for any discussions related to their own remuneration.\n\nThe Director of Human Resources and Head of Reward advised on HR strategy and the application of HR policies across the wider organisation.",

FIT are founding members of, and adhere to, the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct. The Code defines the roles of consultants, including the requirement to have due regard to the organisation's strategy, financial situation, pay philosophy, the Board's statutory duties and the views of investors and other stakeholders.

FIT provides no other services and has no other connection to the Company or individual Directors.\n\nFreshfields LLP also provided advice on legal matters, such as share plan rules, during the year.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThrough the internal Board evaluation process which was carried out during the year, it was confirmed that the Remuneration Committee continued to operate effectively. Details of the wider annual evaluation process are set out on pages 118 and 119 \uf150 .\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee typically carries out a remuneration risk assessment on an annual basis to identify and evaluate the risks inherent in our Directors' Remuneration Policy. Important risk mitigators identified included the broad balance of clear financial and non-financial performance measures, targets which are set in line with SSE's business plans and an overall approach to pay design which rewards the delivery of strong, yet sustainable, performance. This year's risk assessment is deferred to an additional committee meeting in August 2021 which will discuss all aspects the forthcoming policy review in 2022.\n\n## Shareholder voting in 2020\n\nOn 12 August 2020, shareholders approved the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2020 and the result is shown below. Also shown below is the result of shareholder voting on the current Directors' Remuneration Policy which was approved at the AGM on 18 July 2019.\n\nANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION /endash.case SHAREHOLDING VOTING IN 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Terms of Reference for the Committee were reviewed during 2020/21 and are available on the Company's website ( sse.com \uf295 ).

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY /endash.case A SUMMARY\n\nThe SSE's Directors' Remuneration Policy (the 'Policy') was approved with over 99% of shareholder support at the AGM on 18 July 2019. The full Policy is provided in the 2019 Annual Report \uf223 . We believe that SSE's directors' remuneration policy, practice and engagement with employees and shareholders complies fully with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nAt the time the Policy was approved some of the provisions of the new UK Corporate Governance Code were not directly relevant given the financial year, but nonetheless did feature in the Committee's thinking when determining the Policy and how it would be operated. For completeness, we have noted below how the Committee has address the six factors as set out in the Code:\n\n## Clarity\n\n## Simplicity\n\n- \u00b7 Our directors' remuneration policy is designed to be sustainable and simple and to facilitate diligent and effective stewardship that is vital to the delivery of SSE's core purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow, and our strategy of creating value for shareholders and all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The Policy is an update of the previous Policy, with minimal structural changes so is already embedded into the business and is well understood by participants and shareholders alike.\n- \u00b7 The Policy clearly sets out the terms under which it can be operated including appropriate limits in terms of quantum, the measures which can be used and discretions which could be applied if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Transparency in approach has been a cornerstone of our Policy. Detailed disclosure of the relevant performance assessments and outcomes is provided for shareholders to consider.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Predictability\n\n- \u00b7 Appropriate limits are stipulated in the Policy and within the respective plan rules.\n- \u00b7 The Committee also has appropriate discretions to override formulaic outturns under the assessment of the variable incentive plans.\n- \u00b7 The Committee undertakes an annual risk review of the Policy and its operation. Identified risks are considered with appropriate mitigation strategies or tolerance levels agreed.\n- \u00b7 Regular interaction with the Audit Committee and the SHEA Committee ensures relevant risk factors are considered when setting or assessing performance targets.\n- \u00b7 Clawback and malus provisions are in place across all incentive plans.\n\n## Proportionality\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- \u00b7 Variable incentive pay outcomes are clearly dependent on delivering the Company's strategy.\n- \u00b7 Performance is assessed on a broad basis, including a combination of financial, operational and ESG which ensures there is no undue focus on a single metric which may be at the detriment of other stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The Committee also has the discretion to override formulaic outcomes if they are deemed inappropriate in light of the wider performance of the Company and considering the experience of stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 At the heart of the Policy is a focus on the long-term sustainability of the business. This reflects the whole business culture which is aligned to effective stewardship which creates value for all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Our incentive plans and, in particular the performance measures used, reflect our values which means doing the right thing, promoting fairness at work and paying our fair share.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that SSE's remuneration principles are enduring and that the existing policy sufficiently addresses current legislation whilst maintaining adequate flexibility to withstand any recent business changes. For these reasons, it is proposed that the policy remains unchanged in 2021/22 with the exception of the current Energy Director's pension reduction which is to be accelerated by two years as explained on the previous page.\n\n- \u00b7 The possible reward outcomes can be easily quantified, and these are reviewed by the Committee.\n- \u00b7 The graphical illustrations provided in the Policy, clearly show the potential scenarios of performance and pay outcomes which would result.\n- \u00b7 Performance is reviewed regularly so there are no surprises at the end of period assessment.\n- \u00b7 Our arrangements include a market standard annual incentive and long-term share plan, each of which is explained in detail in our Policy.\n- \u00b7 No complex or artificial structures are required to operate the plans.",

Any Ordinary Shares held in treasury have no voting rights.\n\nA shareholder entitled to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting may exercise their right to vote in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate representatives. To be valid, notification of the appointment of a proxy must be received not less than 48 hours before the general meeting at which the person named in the proxy notice proposes to vote. The Directors may in their discretion determine that in calculating the 48-hour period, no account be taken of any part of a day which is not a working day.\n\nEmployees who participate in the Share Incentive Plan whose shares remain in the schemes' trust give directions to the trustees to vote on their behalf by way of a Form of Direction. SSE also has a Share Plan Account service with Computershare available to employees with shares arising from a SAYE option maturity, which are voted through the nominee.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies to the European Union and applicable United Kingdom law, and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law) including Financial Reporting Standard 101, 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\nUnder company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;\n- \u00b7 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 assess the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease\n- \u00b7 operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlistair Phillips-Davies Chief Executive 25 May 2021\n\nGregor Alexander Finance Director",

        "page_content": "## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nWhen assessing, discussing and measuring the Group's financial performance, management refer to measures used for internal performance management. These measures are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as such are considered to be Alternative Performance Measures ('APMs').\n\nBy their nature, APMs are not uniformly applied by all preparers including other participants in the Group's industry. Accordingly, APMs used by the Group may not be comparable to other companies within the Group's industry.\n\n## Purpose\n\nAPMs are used by management to aid comparison and assess historical performance against internal performance benchmarks and across reporting periods. These measures provide an ongoing and consistent basis to assess performance by excluding items that are materially non-recurring, uncontrollable or exceptional. These measures can be classified in terms of their key financial characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit measures allow management to assess and benchmark underlying business performance during the year. They are primarily used by operational management to measure operating profit contribution and are also used by the Board to assess performance against business plan.\n- \u00b7 Capital measures allow management to track and assess the progress of the Group's significant ongoing investment in capital assets and projects against their investment cases, including the expected timing of their operational deployment.\n- \u00b7 Debt measures allow management to record and monitor both operating cash generation and the Group's ongoing financing and liquidity position.\n\n## Changes to APMs in the period\n\nIn the year the Group changed its adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric to adjust for proceeds received in the year ended 31 March 2021 from the refinancing of joint venture capital projects. The rationale for including this adjustment to these APMs is set out in adjustment number 20 on page 175 \uf150 .\n\n## Impact of coronavirus on the Group's APMs\n\nThe Group has not adjusted its APMs for the impact of coronavirus. The Group has assessed that it incurred a reduction in underlying operating profit as a result of coronavirus estimated at \u00a3168.7m for the year ended 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a318.2m). The adjusted results of the Group set out in the tables below have not been adjusted to remove this impact.\n\nWhile the Group has not adjusted its APMs for the impact of coronavirus, \u00a333.7m of coronavirus related bad debt costs were classified as exceptional in the year ended 31 March 2020. In the year ended 31 March 2021, \u00a326.1m of the exceptional provision recognised in the prior year has been released. The initial outbreak of the pandemic in the Group's markets happened late in the prior financial year; it was noted at that point that the exceptional provision was made based on the best estimates available and that the Group would continue to monitor the situation. Subsequently, the impact of government support schemes, lockdowns and other factors have contributed to better than expected debt recovery in the current year giving rise to the exceptional release. Further information on the judgement applied in relation to coronavirus in the current and prior year is included in Note 4.2(i).\n\nThe following table explains the key APMs applied by the Group and referred to in these statements:\n\nClosest equivalent\n\n| Group APM                                                           | Purpose         | IFRS measure      | Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements   | Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA  (earnings before  interest, tax,  depreciation and | Profit  measure | Operating profit  | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7                                                    | Movement on operating and joint venture financing derivatives   ('certain re-measurements') Exceptional items Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Adjusted operating  profit                                          | Profit  measure | Operating profit  | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7                                                    | Movement on operating and joint venture financing derivatives   ('certain re-measurements') Exceptional items Depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Adjusted profit  before tax                                         | Profit  measure | Profit before tax | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7                                           | Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax Movement on operating and financing derivatives ('certain re-measurements') Exceptional items Depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts Interest on net pension assets/liabilities (IAS 19) Share of non-recurring joint venture refinancing costs (prior year only) |",

profit measure\n\n## 1  Movement on operating and financing derivatives ('certain re-measurements')\n\nThis adjustment can be designated between operating and financing derivatives.\n\nOperating derivatives are contracts where the Group's Energy Portfolio Management ('EPM') function enters into forward commitments or options to buy or sell electricity, gas and other commodities to meet the future demand requirements of the Group's Business Energy and Airtricity operating units, or to optimise the value of its SSE Renewables, Thermal or discontinued Gas Production assets. Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IFRS 9 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement (as part of 'certain re-measurements'). The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments due to the volatility that can arise on revaluation. The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominantly be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9 are accounted for as 'own use' contracts and are consequently not recorded until the commodity is delivered and the contract is settled. In addition, gas purchased by the Group's Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is also held at fair value with gains and losses on re-measurement recognised as part of 'certain re-measurements'.\n\nFinancing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted (mark-to-market) interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group to manage its banking and liquidity requirements as well as risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures. Changes in the fair value of those financing derivatives are reflected in the income statement (as part of 'certain re-measurements'). The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.\n\nThe re-measurements arising from operating and financing derivatives, and the tax effects thereof, are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\n## 2  Exceptional Items\n\nExceptional charges or credits, and the tax effects thereof, are considered unusual by nature or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the underlying performance of the Group to be properly understood. Further explanation for the classification of an item as exceptional is included in Note 3.2.",

        "page_content": "## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES CONTINUED\n\n## Rationale for adjustments continued\n\nAdjustments to profit measure continued\n\n## 3  Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax\n\nThis adjustment can be split between the Group's share of interest and the Group's share of tax arising from its investments in equity accounted joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe Group is required to report profit before interest and tax ('operating profit') including its share of the profit after tax of its equity accounted joint ventures and associates. However, for internal performance management purposes and for consistency of treatment, SSE reports its relevant adjusted profit measures before its share of the interest and/or tax on joint ventures and associates.\n\n## 4  Share of joint ventures and associates' depreciation and amortisation\n\nFor management purposes, the Group considers EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) based on a sum-of-the-parts derived metric which includes a share of the EBITDA from equity accounted investments. While this is not equal to adjusted cash generated from operating activities, it is considered useful by management in assessing a proxy for such a measure, given the complexity of the Group structure and the range of investment structures utilised. For the purpose of calculating the 'Net Debt to EBITDA' metric referred at page 73 \uf150 , 'adjusted EBITDA' is further adjusted to remove the proportion of adjusted EBITDA from equityaccounted joint ventures relating to off-balance sheet debt (see Note 5.1(v)).\n\n## 5  Depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts\n\nThe Group's operating strategy includes securing value creation from divestments of stakes in certain assets and businesses namely its offshore and (future) international SSE Renewables developments. In addition, for strategic purposes the Group may also decide to bring in equity partners in other businesses and assets. Where SSE's interest in such vehicles changes from full to joint control, and the subsequent arrangement is classified as an equity accounted joint venture, SSE will recognise a fair value uplift on the remeasurement of its retained equity investment. Those uplifts will be treated as exceptional (and non-cash) gains in the year of the relevant transactions completing. These uplifts create assets which are depreciated or amortised over the remaining life of the underlying assets or contracts in those businesses with the charge being included in the Group's adjusted depreciation and amortisation expense. The Group's adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share have therefore been adjusted to exclude this depreciation and amortisation expense from the fair value uplift given the charges derived from significant one-off gains which are treated as exceptional when initially recognised.\n\n## 6  Release of deferred income\n\nThe Group deducts the release of deferred income in the year from its adjusted EBITDA metric as it principally relates to grants or customer contributions against depreciating assets. As the metric adds back depreciation, the income is also deducted.\n\n## 7  Non-recurring joint venture refinancing costs\n\nThe Group's joint venture investment, Beatrice Offshore Winds Limited ('BOWL'), completed a refinancing of its debt in the year ended 31 March 2020, which resulted in transaction costs from the original debt of \u00a327.2m being expensed to the income statement of the joint venture. In addition, \u00a33.5m of costs related to the repayment of the original instrument were incurred. The Group's 40% share of the \u00a330.7m expense is \u00a312.3m, which has been adjusted from the Group's adjusted profit before tax and the Group's adjusted finance costs as refinancing of this scale is non-recurring, considered to be specific to this instance and therefore not representative of normal operations.\n\n## 8  Interest on net pension assets/liabilities (IAS 19)\n\nThe Group's interest charges relating to defined benefit pension schemes are derived from the net assets/liabilities of the schemes as valued under IAS 19. This will mean that the charge recognised in any given year will be dependent on the impact of actuarial assumptions such as inflation and discount rates. To avoid income statement volatility derived from this basis of measurement and reflecting the non-cash nature of these charges, the Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures.\n\n## 9  Deferred tax\n\nThe Group adjusts for deferred tax when arriving at adjusted profit after tax, adjusted earnings per share and its adjusted effective rate of tax. Deferred tax arises as a result of differences in accounting and tax bases that give rise to potential future accounting credits or charges. As the Group remains committed to its ongoing capital programme, the liabilities associated are not expected to reverse and accordingly the Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures.\n\n## Adjustments to debt measure\n\n## 10  Hybrid equity\n\nThe characteristics of certain hybrid capital securities mean they qualify for recognition as equity rather than debt under IFRS. Consequently, their coupon payments are presented within dividends rather than within finance costs. As a result, the coupon payments are not included in SSE's adjusted profit before tax measure. In order to present total funding provided from sources other than ordinary shareholders, SSE presents its adjusted net debt measure inclusive of hybrid capital to better reflect the Group's funding position.\n\n## 11  Outstanding liquid funds\n\nOutstanding liquid funds are SSE cash balances held by counterparties as collateral at the year end. SSE includes these as cash until they are utilised for the purposes of calculating adjusted net debt. Loans with a maturity of less than three months are also included in this adjustment. The Group includes this adjustment in order to better reflect the immediate cash resources to which it has access, which in turn better reflects the Group's funding position.",

        "page_content": "## 12  Leases\n\nSSE's reported loans and borrowings include lease liabilities on contracts under the scope of IFRS 16, which are not directly related to the external financing of the Group. The Group excludes these liabilities from its adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure to better reflect the Group's underlying funding position with its primary sources of capital.\n\n## 13  Cash presented as held for sale\n\nWhere the Group holds cash balances as part of a disposal group, as was the case at 31 March 2019, those balances will be excluded from the Group's debt measure. As the Group will continue to fund such held for sale businesses through intercompany loans and borrowings, any cash held by the business will be an adjustment in the Group adjusted net debt measure.\n\n## Adjustments to capex measure\n\n## 14  Other expenditure\n\nOther expenditure primarily represents subsequently derecognised development expenditure which is excluded to better reflect the Group's ongoing capital position.\n\n## 15  Customer funded additions\n\nCustomer funded additions represents additions to electricity and other networks funded by customer contributions. Given these are directly funded by customers, these have been excluded to better reflect the Group's underlying investment position.\n\n## 16  Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates (ROCs) and are not included in the Group's 'capital expenditure and investment' APM to better reflect the Group's investment in enduring operational assets.\n\n## 17  Additions through business combinations\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group took a controlling interest in the Viking partnership and acquired a windfarm portfolio in Wexford in Ireland, resulting in an addition to intangible assets on consolidation of \u00a326.4m. In the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group acquired 50% interest in Seagreen Wind Energy Limited ('Seagreen'). On consolidation of Seagreen, \u00a3143.4m of development asset was included in the Group's consolidated intangible assets. These additions have been removed from 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' as they were not direct capital expenditure by the Group.\n\n## 18  Additions subsequently disposed/impaired\n\nIn the year the Group funded \u00a319.7m of capex additions in relation to the Seagreen windfarm prior to disposal. On 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in Seagreen 1 (see Note 12.1), therefore the capex incurred prior to that date has been excluded from the Group's net adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric. In the year ended 31 March 2020, there were additions of \u00a344.6m in the Group's Gas Production segment which were subsequently impaired following the annual impairment assessment. Additions subsequently disposed in the year ended 31 March 2019 represent capital additions related to Stronelairg and Dunmaglass windfarms and SSE Telecommunications prior to their disposal and subsequent recognition as part of SSE's investment in joint ventures.\n\n## 19  Joint ventures and associates' additions\n\nJoint ventures and associates' additions represent direct funding provided to joint venture and associate arrangements in relation to capital expenditure projects. This has been included to better reflect the Group's use of directly funded equity accounted vehicles to grow the Group's asset base. Asset additions funded by project finance raised within the Group's joint ventures and associates is not included in this adjustment.\n\n## 20  Refinancing proceeds/refunds\n\nThe Group's model for developing large scale capital projects within joint ventures and associates involves project finance being raised within those entities. Where the Group funds early stage capex which is then subsequently reimbursed to SSE following the receipt of project finance within the vehicle, the refinance proceeds are included in the Group's net adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric. In the year ended 31 March 2021, the Group received reimbursed capex of \u00a3246.1m in relation to Seagreen windfarm and \u00a3182.5m in relation to Doggerbank windfarm. These receipts have been deducted from the Group's adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric.\n\n## Impact of discontinued operations on the Group's APMs\n\nThe following metrics have been adjusted in all periods presented to exclude the contribution of the Group's Gas Production operations which is held for sale at 31 March 2021 (see Note 12.3) and SSE Energy Services which was disposed on 15 January 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted operating profit;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net finance costs;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted profit before tax;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted current tax charge; and\n- \u00b7 Adjusted earnings per share.\n\n'Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital', and 'investment and capital expenditure' have not been adjusted as the Group continues to fund the discontinued operations until the date of disposal.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\n## 1.  General information and basis of preparation\n\n## 1.1  General information\n\nSSE plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Scotland. The address of the registered office is given on the back cover. The Group's operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group, these can be seen on pages 283 to 295 \uf150 .\n\n## 1.2  Basis of preparation\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 25 May 2021. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union ('adopted IFRS').\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 December 2022. The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis. In assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic was considered and has been included as an other accounting judgement (see Note 4.2 (i)).\n\nIn addition, further details of the Group's liquidity position and going concern review, including the potential economic impacts of coronavirus, are provided in A6 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 272 \uf150 .\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements of the Group are prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain gas inventory, derivative financial instruments, financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss or other comprehensive income on initial recognition, assets of the Group pension schemes which are measured at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method. The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view. The financial statements of the Group are presented in pounds sterling. The basis for including operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling is provided in A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 250 \uf150 .\n\n## Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at pages 186 to 188 \uf150 .\n\n## Changes to presentation\n\nThere have been no changes to presentation during the current year.\n\nDuring the prior year, the Group assessed that its Gas Production business met the criteria to be presented as held for sale and a discontinued operation. The business remains held for sale at 31 March 2021 and continues to be classified as a discontinued operation (see Note 4.2.1). The results of the business are therefore presented as discontinued operations in the income statement, cash flow statement and related notes, in line with the requirements of IFRS 5 ' Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations '.\n\n## Changes to estimates\n\nThere have been no changes to the basis of accounting estimates during the current year.\n\nDuring the prior year the Group performed a detailed technical review of the operating lives of its onshore and offshore windfarms and changed the estimated useful life of the majority of its onshore windfarms from 20 to 25 years. The change to this estimate resulted in an increase to adjusted and reported profit before tax of \u00a330.2m in the prior year.\n\n## 2.  New accounting policies and reporting changes\n\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and in the A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on pages 250 to 260 \uf150 .\n\n## 2.1  New standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted by the Group\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the prior year. From 1 January 2020 (thus 1 April 2020 for the Group), amendments to IFRS 3: Business Combinations; Interest Rate Benchmark Reform; amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8; and the conceptual framework for financial reporting became effective. None have had a material impact on the Group. From 1 June 2020 an amendment to IFRS 16 for coronavirus related rent concessions became effective. The Group has not received any rent concessions and so has not early adopted the amendment as it would have no impact on the presentation of these Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## 2.  New accounting policies and reporting changes continued\n\n## 2.2  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued, but not yet adopted by the Group\n\nThe following standard has been issued but not yet adopted by the Group within these financial statements, because application is not yet mandatory or because adoption by the UK remains outstanding at this point in time:\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' is effective from 1 January 2023 (and thus 1 April 2023 to the Group) and is subject to endorsement\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' was originally issued in May 2017, then reissued in June 2020, and replaces IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and sets out the requirements that a company should apply in reporting information about insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds.\n\nWhilst the Group operates a captive insurance company, SSE Insurance Limited, its primary purpose is to provide greater control over SSE's management of specific risks, with minor annual premium payments made. It is therefore not expected that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other interpretations and amendments\n\nIn addition to these issued standards, there are a number of other interpretations, amendments and annual improvement project recommendations that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group because application is not yet mandatory or because adoption by the UK remains outstanding at this point in time. These are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.  Adjusted accounting measures\n\nThe Group applies the use of adjusted accounting measures throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements. These measures enable the Directors to present the underlying performance of the Group and its segments to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner. The adjustments applied and certain terms such as 'adjusted operating profit', 'adjusted EPS', 'adjusted EBITDA', 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' and 'adjusted net debt and Hybrid equity' that are not defined under IFRS and are explained in more detail below. In addition, the section 'Alternative Performance Measures' at page 172 \uf150 provides further context and explanation of these terms.\n\n## 3.1  Adjusted measures\n\nThe Directors assess the performance of the Group and its reportable segments based on 'adjusted measures'. These measures are used for internal performance management and are believed to be appropriate for explaining underlying performance to users of the accounts. These measures are also deemed the most useful for the ordinary shareholders of the Company and for other stakeholders.\n\nThe performance of the reportable segments is reported based on adjusted profit before interest and tax ('adjusted operating profit'). This is reconciled to reported profit before interest and tax by adding back exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see Note 3.2 below), depreciation on fair value uplifts and after the removal of interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe performance of the Group is reported based on adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items and certain remeasurements (see Note 3.2 below), depreciation on fair value uplifts, non-recurring financing costs in joint ventures, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. The interest charges or credits on defined benefit schemes removed are non-cash and are subject to variation based on actuarial valuations of scheme liabilities.\n\nThe Group also uses adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation ('adjusted EBITDA') as an alternative operating performance measure which acts as a management proxy for cash generated from operating activities. This does not take into account the rights and obligations that SSE has in relation to its equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. This measure excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see Note 3.2 below), the depreciation charged on fair value uplifts, non-recurring financing costs in joint ventures, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes, depreciation and amortisation from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates and interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. For the purpose of calculating the 'Net Debt to EBITDA' metric referred at page 73 \uf150 , 'adjusted EBITDA' is further adjusted to remove the proportion of adjusted EBITDA from equity-accounted joint ventures relating to off-balance sheet debt (see Note 5.1(v)).\n\nThe Group's key performance measure is adjusted earnings per share (EPS), which is based on basic earnings per share before exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see Note 3.2 below), depreciation on fair value uplifts, non-recurring financing costs in joint ventures, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and after the removal of deferred taxation and other taxation items. Deferred taxation is excluded from the Group's adjusted EPS because of the Group's significant ongoing capital investment programme, which means that the deferred tax is unlikely to reverse. Adjusted profit after tax is presented on a basis consistent with adjusted EPS except for the non-inclusion of payments to holders of hybrid equity.\n\nThe financial statements also include an 'adjusted net debt and Hybrid equity' measure. This presents financing information on the basis used for internal liquidity risk management. This measure excludes obligations due under lease arrangements and includes cash held as collateral on commodity trading exchanges, cash presented as held for sale and other short term loans. The measure represents the capital owed to investors, lenders and equity holders other than the ordinary shareholders. As with 'adjusted earnings per share', this measure is considered to be of particular relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\n## 3.  Adjusted accounting measures continued\n\n## 3.1  Adjusted measures continued\n\nFinally, the financial statements include an 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' measure. This metric represents the capital invested by the Group in projects that are anticipated to provide a return on investment over future years or which otherwise support Group operations and is consistent with internally applied metrics. This therefore includes capital additions to Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets and also the Group's direct funding of joint venture and associates capital projects. The Group has considered it appropriate to report these values both internally and externally in this manner due to its use of equity-accounted investment vehicles to grow the Group's asset base, where the Group is providing a source of funding to the vehicle through either loans or equity. The Group does not include project funded capital additions in this metric, nor does it include other capital invested in joint ventures and associates. Where initial capital funding of an equity accounted joint venture is refunded, these refunds are deducted from the metric in the year the refund is received. In addition, the Group excludes from this metric additions to its Property, Plant and Equipment funded by Customer Contributions and additions to Intangible Assets associated with Allowances and Certificates. As with 'adjusted earnings per share', this measure is considered to be of particular relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.\n\nReconciliations from reported measures to adjusted measures along with further description of the rationale for those adjustments are included in the 'Adjusted Performance Measures' section at pages 172 to 177 \uf150 .\n\nWhere the Group have referred to an adjusted performance measure in the financial statements the following sign is presented to denote this.\n\n## 3.2  Exceptional items and certain re-measurements\n\nExceptional items are those charges or credits that are considered unusual by nature and/or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. The trigger points for recognition of items as exceptional will tend to be non-recurring although exceptional charges may impact the same asset class or segment over time.\n\nMarket conditions that have deteriorated significantly over time will only be captured to the extent observable at the balance sheet date. Examples of items that may be considered exceptional include material asset or business impairment charges, reversals of historic impairments, business restructuring costs and reorganisation costs, significant realised gains or losses on disposal, unrealised fair value adjustments on part disposal of a subsidiary and provisions in relation to contractual settlements associated with significant disputes and claims.\n\nThe Group operates a framework for estimating whether items are considered to be exceptional. This framework, which is reviewed annually, estimates the materiality of each broad set of potentially exceptional circumstances, after consideration of strategic impact and likelihood of recurrence, by reference to the Group's key performance measure of Adjusted Earnings per Share. This framework estimates that any item greater than \u00a330.0m will be considered exceptional, with lower thresholds applied to circumstances that are considered to have a greater strategic impact and are less likely to recur. The only exception to this threshold is for gains or losses on disposal or divestment of international or offshore wind farm projects which will be considered non-exceptional in line with the Group's expressed strategy to generate recurring gains in these businesses. Finally, in response to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Group's financial position at March 2020, a specific category of exceptional charge was identified and defined relating to impairment of current assets assessed as being a direct consequence of the outbreak. Further detail is noted at 4.2(i) below.\n\nCertain re-measurements are re-measurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are accounted for as held for trading or as fair value hedges in accordance with the Group's policy for such financial instruments, or remeasurements on stocks of commodities held at the balance sheet date. The amount shown in the before exceptional items and certain re-measurements results for these contracts is the amount settled in the year as disclosed in Note 24.1.\n\nThis excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group's own use requirements which are not recorded until the underlying commodity is delivered.\n\nThe impact of changes in Corporation Tax rates on deferred tax balances are also included within certain remeasurements.\n\n## 3.3  Other additional disclosures\n\nAs permitted by IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', the Group's income statement discloses additional information in respect of joint ventures and associates, exceptional items and certain re-measurements to aid understanding of the Group's financial performance and to present results clearly and consistently.\n\n## 4.  Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements. The Group's key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.",

        "page_content": "## 4.  Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued\n\n## 4.1  Significant financial judgements\n\nThe preparation of these financial statements has specifically considered the following significant financial judgements, some of which are also areas of estimation uncertainty as noted below.\n\n## (i)  Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets - estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets to determine whether any impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded. The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2021 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to thermal power generation and the carrying value of the held for sale gas production business. In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit (CGU) at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs.\n\nChanges to the estimates and assumptions on factors such as regulation and legislation changes, power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, expected proven and probable reserves, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's income statement and balance sheet.\n\nFurther detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment charges and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at Note 15. Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1.\n\n## (ii)  Retirement benefit obligations - estimation uncertainty\n\nThe assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the period are based on the Group's best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.\n\nFurther detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the resulting movements in obligations and the sensitivity of key assumptions to the obligation is disclosed at Note 23.\n\n## (iii)  Revenue recognition - Customers unbilled supply of energy - estimation uncertainty\n\nRevenue from energy supply activities undertaken by the Business Energy and Airtricity businesses includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This estimation comprises both billed revenue (disclosed as trade receivables) and unbilled revenue (disclosed as accrued income) and is calculated based on applying the tariffs and contract rates applicable to customers against estimated customer consumption and taking account of various factors including usage patterns, weather trends and externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies. A change in the assumptions underpinning the calculation would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period. The sensitivity associated with this judgement factor is disclosed at Note 18.\n\nThis estimation is subject to an internal corroboration process which compares of calculated unbilled volumes to a theoretical 'perfect billing' benchmark measure of unbilled volumes (in GWh and millions of therms) derived from historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and aggregated metering data used in industry reconciliation processes. Furthermore, actual meter readings and billings continue to be compared to unbilled estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of the accounts.\n\n## 4.2  Other accounting judgements\n\n## (i) Accounting for the impacts of coronavirus - accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the UK had entered a first period of lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which had been implemented late in the Group's financial year. The Group assessed at that time that due to the expected impact to credit risk, specifically the recovery of current and aged debt balances in its Business Energy and Airtricity businesses, an additional exceptional provision of \u00a333.7m should be recognised in its Business Energy (\u00a327.7m) and Airtricity (\u00a36.0m) businesses specifically associated with the change in circumstances resulting from the pandemic.\n\nIn the subsequent financial year, the UK economy was significantly affected by the pandemic. The Group has seen reduced electricity demand impact its use of system revenue in its SSEN Distribution business; reduced consumption from business customers; and reduced activity in its Enterprise business as direct impacts from the pandemic. These impacts are estimated at \u00a3168.7m. However, the impact on recovery of customer debt balances at 31 March 2020 has been better than expected, largely due to support provided to customers through government support schemes. Accordingly, the Group has reversed \u00a326.1m of the exceptional provision recognised in the prior year (see Note 7.1). The basis of determining the provisions for bad and doubtful debts is explained within the Accompanying Information section A6 at pages 271 to 279 \uf150 . While the provisions are considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded, and consequently on the charge or credit to the income statement.",

Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued\n\n## 4.2  Other accounting judgements continued\n\nThe analysis of the ageing of trade receivables, movement in the provision for bad and doubtful debts and the net trade receivables expected to be recoverable is detailed within the Accompanying Information section A6 at pages 271 to 279 \uf150 .\n\nDuring the year the Group has successfully accessed capital markets and has managed to refinance maturing debt through a market impacted by coronavirus. The impact of coronavirus on the financial position and going concern basis of the Group is set out in the Group's going concern commentary at A6.3 and in the Viability Statement on page 56 \uf150 .\n\n## 4.2.1  Other accounting judgements - changes from prior year\n\n## Held for sale classification of the Group's investment in Gas Production\n\nAt 31 March 2020, the Group classified its investment in Gas Production assets as held for sale. At that date, the Group was engaged in discussions with potential buyers for the business but a transaction had not been agreed, and, due to economic conditions prevailing at the time, classifying the business as held for sale was judgemental. On 22 December 2020, the Group announced it had reached an agreement with Viaro Energy through its subsidiary RockRose Energy Limited to purchase the business for initial consideration of \u00a3120m. At 31 March 2021 the business remains held for sale awaiting regulatory approval and partner consent. It is expected the transaction will complete in Q1 of the 2021/22 financial year.\n\n## 4.3  Other areas of estimation uncertainty\n\n## (i)  Tax provisioning\n\nThe Group has a number of open tax issues with the tax authorities in the UK and Republic of Ireland, the two jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Where management makes a judgement that an outflow of funds is probable, and a reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, provision is made for the best estimate of the most likely liability.\n\nIn estimating any such liability, the Group applies a risk-based approach, taking into account the specific circumstances of each dispute based on management's interpretation of tax law and supported, where appropriate, by discussion and analysis by external tax advisors. These estimates are inherently judgemental and could change substantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge. Provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, however the resolution of tax issues can take a considerable period of time to conclude and it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will be different from the amounts provided. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in current tax liabilities, and total \u00a337.6m at 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a339.4m). The Group estimates that a reasonably possible range of settlement outcomes for the uncertain tax provisions given their binary nature is between nil and the full value of the provision.\n\n## (ii)  Decommissioning costs\n\nThe estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment assets is reviewed periodically, with a full reassessment by an independent decommissioning consultant performed in the year to 31 March 2019. Decommissioning costs in relation to gas exploration and production assets are periodically agreed with the field operators and reflect the latest expected economic production lives of the fields. At 31 March 2021 the Group's Gas Production assets are held for sale. Under the agreed terms of the disposal the Group will retain 60% of the decommissioning obligation. Provision is made for the estimated discounted cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date. The Group's next formal reassessment by independent decommissioning experts will be performed in the financial year to March 2022.\n\nThe dates for settlement of future decommissioning costs are uncertain, particularly for gas exploration and production assets where reassessment of gas and liquids reserves and fluctuations in commodity prices can lengthen or shorten the field life. The Group is currently incurring decommissioning costs related to the Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry power stations, with the remaining provision expected to being increasingly utilised over the next ten years and continue out to 2040.\n\nFurther detail on the assumptions made and movement in decommissioning costs during the year are disclosed at Note 20.",

Included within Trade and other payables (Note 19) is \u00a3240.6m (2020: \u00a3262.9m) of contract related liabilities. Contract related assets reflect the Group's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have transferred to the customer, and contract related liabilities reflect the Group's obligation to transfer future goods or services for which the Group has already received consideration. Contract related assets and liabilities principally arise in the Enterprise reporting segment with changes during the periods reflecting ongoing contract progress, offset by cash receipts or customer invoicing.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed information related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations on the basis that the Group's contracts either have an original expected duration of less than one year, or permit the Group to recognise revenue as invoiced.\n\nRevenue by geographical location on continuing operations is as follows:\n\n|         | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|---------|------------|------------|\n| UK      | 5,834.4    | 5,804.3    |\n| Ireland | 992.0      | 996.3      |\n|         | 6,826.4    | 6,800.6    |",

Audit related assurance services include fees incurred in relation to regulatory accounts and returns required by Ofgem. A description of the work of the Audit Committee is set out on pages 128 to 137 \uf150 and includes an explanation of how auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded when non-audit services are provided by the auditors.",

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.1  Exceptional items\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2021, the Group recognised a net exceptional credit of \u00a3850.3m in its continuing operations. The net exceptional credit is primarily due to gains on disposal of the Group's stakes in Ferrybridge Multifuel (\u00a3669.9m), Walney offshore windfarm (\u00a3188.7m) and Maple SmartMeterCo (\u00a370.4m). In addition, the Group reversed \u00a326.1m of prior year exceptional provisions for bad debt arising from coronavirus and recorded exceptional gains following the fair value uplift of its retained stakes in SSE Slough Multifuel Limited (\u00a321.3m) and Seagreen Holdco 1 Limited (\u00a325.7m). These exceptional credits are offset by an impairment to the Group's Great Island Thermal CCGT plant of \u00a358.1m and a write down to fair value less costs to sell SSE Contracting, which is held for sale at the balance sheet date, of \u00a351.2m. Finally, the Group incurred \u00a324.2m of further charges related to the disposal of SSE Energy Services which was completed in the prior year and has reduced the overall gain on disposal, completed in the year ended 31 March 2019, of SSE Telecommunications Limited by \u00a321.8m.\n\nThe net exceptional charges/(credits) recognised can be summarised as follows:\n\n|                                         | Property, Plant &  Equipment   (Note 14)   \u00a3m   | Intangible   assets   (Note 13)   \u00a3m   | Provisions &  other charges  \u00a3m   | Trade  receivables   \u00a3m   | Other   receivables   \u00a3m   | Total charges/  (credits)   \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Thermal Electricity Generation (i)      | 58.1                                            | -                                      | -                                 | -                         | -                          | 58.1                             |\n| Customer bad debt provisioning (ii)     | -                                               | -                                      | -                                 | (26.1)                    | -                          | (26.1)                           |\n| SSE Contracting (iii)                   |                                                 |                                        | 51.2                              |                           |                            | 51.2                             |\n| SSE Energy Services disposal costs (iv) | 15.1                                            | 5.2                                    | 3.9                               | -                         | -                          | 24.2                             |\n| Neos Networks (v)                       | -                                               | -                                      | 20.2                              | -                         | 1.6                        | 21.8                             |\n| Other charges (vi)                      | (1.9)                                           | -                                      | -                                 | -                         | (1.6)                      | (3.5)                            |\n| Disposal gains (vii)                    | -                                               | -                                      | -                                 | -                         | (976.0)                    | (976.0)                          |\n| Total exceptional items                 | 71.3                                            | 5.2                                    | 75.3                              | (26.1)                    | (976.0)                    | (850.3)                          |\n\n## (i)  Thermal Electricity Generation - impairment charges\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Group has carried out a formal impairment review in order to assess the carrying value of its CCGT plant at Great Island (see Note 15.2). As a result of the assessment, the Group has recognised an exceptional impairment of \u00a358.1m to the carrying value of the asset, which has arisen following reductions in forward price curves and forecast electricity demand in Ireland.\n\n## (ii)  Customer bad debt provisioning\n\nIn the prior year, the Group recognised an exceptional provision for exposure to bad debts of \u00a333.7m specifically related to the coronavirus pandemic within its Business Energy (\u00a327.7m) and Airtricity (\u00a36.0m) businesses. The initial outbreak of the pandemic happened late the prior year and the UK remained in lockdown at the date of approval of the Annual Report on 16 June 2020, which meant that significant uncertainty surrounded the judgement at that date. The provision reflected the Group's best estimate at that date and was treated as an adjusting post balance sheet event. During the year to 31 March 2021, the Group has achieved higher cash collections in recovery of its debt than was expected, largely due to government support schemes and other factors. As a result, an exceptional reversal of the provision of \u00a320.1m in its Business Energy and \u00a36.0m in its Airtricity businesses has been recognised. See Note 4.2(i) for further detail on the judgement applied related to coronavirus in the current and prior year.\n\n## (iii)  SSE Contracting - impairment charges\n\nOn 1 April 2021, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group announced the sale of its Contracting & Rail business to Aurelius Group. The transaction is for initial consideration of \u00a317.5m, plus a loan note receivable of \u00a35m, and a further \u00a35m of contingent consideration based upon future financial performance of the business. At 31 March 2021, the Group has classified its interest in the business as held for sale (see Note 12.3) and has impaired the carrying amount of the held for sale asset to its net realisable value, resulting in an impairment of \u00a351.2m. The transaction is expected to complete by the end of June 2021.\n\n## (iv)  SSE Energy Services disposal costs\n\nIn the prior year, the Group disposed of its SSE Energy Services business to Ovo Energy Limited, incurring an exceptional loss of \u00a3237.7m. The calculation of the loss included estimates for costs of disposal and separation which have been subsequently re-estimated in the year to 31 March 2021. These additional costs of disposal, which total \u00a324.2m, include increased estimates of the cost of IT separation and decommissioning and the impairment of SSE properties which are wholly (or substantially) leased to the disposal group.\n\n## (v)  Neos Networks adjustment to consideration\n\nIn the financial year to 31 March 2019, the Group disposed of 50% of its stake in Neos Networks Limited (formerly SSE Telecommunications Limited) to Infracapital Partners III, 'Infracap', for initial consideration of \u00a3215.0m and the potential for a further \u00a3165m of contingent consideration dependent on achievement of certain targets. In the current financial year, the Group received further cash proceeds of \u00a344m relating to previously accrued deferred consideration but has also reassessed its position relating to the retained contingent elements and its contractual position with Infracap, with the net impact being the recognition of an exceptional charge of \u00a320.2m.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\n## 7.  Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.1  Exceptional items continued\n\n## (vi)  Other charges\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the Group reassessed its impairment provision recognised in 2017/18 related to its Enterprise Utilities business following improvements in the performance of the Heat Networks assets. The impairment review has resulted in a reversal in impairment of \u00a32.2m in the year. While this reversal is not exceptional, it has been classified as exceptional to align to the classification of the initial impairment.\n\nIn 2017/18 the Group recognised an exceptional impairment related to its Barkip anaerobic digestion plant following operational issues at the site. In the year ended 31 March 2021, the Group disposed of the site for consideration of \u00a31.3m, resulting in a \u00a31.3m reversal of the exceptional impairment recognised in 2017/18. While this reversal is not exceptional, it has been classified as exceptional to align to the classification of the initial impairment.\n\n## (vii)  Disposal gains\n\nDuring the year the Group progressed with its disposal plan for non-core assets announced in June 2020, which has resulted in exceptional gains on disposal. The exceptional gains on disposal totalling \u00a3976.0m are summarised below. Further detail on the disposals in the year is provided in Note 12.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Group announced it had reached an agreement to dispose of its 50% investment in Multifuel Energy Limited and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (together 'MEL') to European Diversified Infrastructure Fund III for headline consideration of \u00a3995m. The agreement was subject to antitrust approval by the European Commission, which was granted on the 7 January 2021 when the transaction completed. The Group recorded an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3669.9m.\n\nOn 2 September 2020, the Group agreed to sell its subsidiary, SSE Renewables Walney Limited, to Greencoat UK Wind Plc for consideration of \u00a3350m, resulting in an exceptional gain on sale of \u00a3188.7m. SSE Renewables Walney Limited was the holding company of the Group's non-operated 25.1% stake in Walney Offshore Wind Farm. As essentially a financial investment and as Walney Offshore Wind Farm Limited has been operational for several years, the disposal is not considered to be aligned to the Group's strategic objective of gaining value from divestment of stakes in offshore or international wind developments, therefore the gain on disposal has been recognised as exceptional.\n\nOn 23 September 2020, the Group disposed of its 33% investment in Maple Topco Limited, the smart meter services provider, for proceeds of \u00a395.3m, recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a370.4m.\n\nOn 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Seagreen Holdco 1 Ltd ('Seagreen 1'), to Total. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a370m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a360m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Seagreen 1 should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a349.0m. Of that gain, \u00a325.7m has been recognised as exceptional, as it represents the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a323.3m of the gain has been included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see Note 3.2).\n\nOn 2 April 2020, the Group disposed of a 50% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, SSE Slough Multifuel Ltd, to Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a310m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a359.1m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Slough Multifuel should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a341.7m. Of that gain, \u00a321.3m has been recognised as exceptional, as it represents the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a320.4m of the gain has been included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see Note 3.2).\n\n## 31 March 2020\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2020, the Group recognised a net exceptional charge of \u00a3209.7m in its continuing operations and a charge of \u00a3529.0m in its discontinued operations. The net exceptional charge in continuing operations was primarily due to the closure of Fiddler's Ferry coal fired power station (\u00a3112.3m), provisions for bad debts as a result of coronavirus of \u00a333.7m, impairments to SSE assets as a result of the disposal of SSE Energy Services (\u00a348.8m) and other asset impairments and restructuring costs of \u00a345.6m. These exceptional charges were offset by gains on disposal of \u00a330.6m in total related to recognition of additional contingent consideration, offset by related costs and including \u00a32.4m of discount unwind, in relation to the 31 March 2019 disposal of SSE Telecommunications and a completion accounts adjustment to the gain on sale of Stronelairg and Dunmaglass windfarms, also from 31 March 2019 financial year.\n\nIn the discontinued operations, the Group incurred an exceptional impairment on its Gas Production assets of \u00a3291.3m to adjust the carrying value of the assets to their expected fair value on disposal, a loss on disposal of SSE Energy Services of \u00a3226.9m and restructuring costs of \u00a310.8m within SSE Energy Services.",

As a result of the closure, the Group incurred a total exceptional charge of \u00a3112.3m, comprising an impairment of the coal and oil inventory and related tax credits of \u00a377.5m; a redundancy provision of \u00a320.5m; and operating losses at the plant since closure announcement of \u00a314.3m.\n\n## (ii)  Other charges\n\nThe Group recognised an exceptional provision for exposure to bad debts of \u00a333.7m specifically related to the coronavirus pandemic within its Business Energy (\u00a327.7m) and Airtricity (\u00a36.0m) businesses. The provision reflected the Group's best estimate at the date of approval of the financial statements of charges that would be incurred on the Group's debt book and was treated as an adjusting post balance sheet event. See Note 7.1 (ii) for impact in the year to 31 March 2021.\n\nThe Group committed to an investment plan in IT software, operations and infrastructure to transform the Group's IT systems to drive growth and profitability. As a result, new agreements with software providers were entered into to allow employees to benefit from cloud based IT arrangements, which resulted in the impairment of legacy software contracts of \u00a334.2m. The Group also incurred redundancy costs of \u00a36.9m following an agreement to outsource certain IT support roles and recognised a charge of \u00a34.4m related to restructuring costs incurred by its SSEN Distribution business.\n\n## (iii)  Other income\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the Group disposed of 50% of SSE Telecommunications to Infracapital Partners III for initial consideration of \u00a3215.0m, with the potential for a further \u00a3165m of consideration contingent upon achievement of future profitability targets and securing certain key customer contracts. In the 31 March 2019 results, the Group assessed that a total of \u00a3230.5m should be recognised in the initial transaction, which resulted in a \u00a3235.4m gain on disposal. At 31 March 2020, the Group reassessed the components of contingent consideration recognised based on updated forecasts of business performance and current status of key customer contract negotiations and related costs and recognised a further \u00a333.1m of consideration, including interest unwind of \u00a32.4m which was treated as exceptional finance income. Incremental exceptional costs of disposal of the business totalling \u00a37.2m have also been recognised, which predominantly related to the expected cost of full IT separation for this business.\n\nThe Group disposed a 49.9% stake in the Stronelairg and Dunmaglass windfarms in the year ended 31 March 2019, recognising a gain on disposal of \u00a3733.0m, including a fair value uplift of \u00a3369.2m. Following the completion of the sale, an adjustment to the consideration of \u00a36.4m was received in the year ended 31 March 2020, offset by a tax adjustment of \u00a31.6m. The adjustment to the gain on sale has been treated as exceptional to align with the treatment of the original disposal in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\n## Charges within discontinued operations\n\n## (iv)  SSE Energy Services - loss on disposal and related charges\n\nOn 15 January 2020 the Group disposed of its household energy and services business in Great Britain ('SSE Energy Services') to Ovo Group Limited ('Ovo'). The Group recognised an exceptional loss on disposal of \u00a3226.9m (recognised within discontinued operations) and incurred impairment charges on Group IT assets connected to the transaction totalling \u00a348.8m (recognised within continuing operations). Within the business there were also redundancy costs of \u00a310.8m incurred in the year.\n\n## (v)  Gas Production - impairment charges\n\nThe Group recorded an exceptional impairment charge of \u00a3291.3m related to the carrying value of assets and liabilities held for sale. The impairment was calculated based on the fair value of the business following negotiations with potential buyers and reflected the reduction in gas prices through the year.",

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.1  Exceptional items continued\n\n## 31 March 2019\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2019, the Group recognised a net exceptional credit of \u00a31,010.2m in its continuing operations and a charge of \u00a324.6m in its discontinued operation. The gain in the continuing operations is primarily due to gains on disposal of businesses and assets totalling \u00a31,096.9m. These gains on disposal were offset by net asset impairments of \u00a349.9m, reorganisation costs of \u00a327.5m and an exceptional charge for GMP equalisation of \u00a39.3m.\n\nThe net exceptional charges excluding gains on disposal (see Note 12) recognised can be summarised as follows:\n\nProperty, Plant &\n\n|                                           | Equipment   (Note 14)  \u00a3m   | Intangible assets (Note 13) \u00a3m   | Investments  (Note 16)  \u00a3m   | Provisions &  other charges  \u00a3m   | Total charges  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Electricity Generation (i)                | 2.7                         | -                                | (13.3)                       | (0.9)                             | (11.5)              |\n| Disposal costs - SSE Energy Services (ii) | 41.0                        | -                                | -                            | 47.9                              | 88.9                |\n| Pensions GMP equalisation (iii)           | -                           | -                                | -                            | 9.3                               | 9.3                 |\n|                                           | 43.7                        | -                                | (13.3)                       | 56.3                              | 86.7                |\n| Discontinued operations                   | (29.7)                      | 54.3                             | -                            | -                                 | 24.6                |\n| Total SSE Group                           | 14.0                        | 54.3                             | (13.3)                       | 56.3                              | 111.3               |\n\n## (i)  Electricity Generation\n\nOn 24 September 2018, the Group purchased the remaining 50% stake in Seagreen Wind Energy Limited ('Seagreen') taking its ownership to 100% and bringing Seagreen under full control of the Group. As part of the acquisition, the Group reversed a previous impairment charge of \u00a314.2m based on its renewed commitment to developing the prospect. The reversal of the impairment was included as an exceptional credit due to the original impairment of the Group's offshore wind portfolio being treated as exceptional in 2013/14.\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2019, the Group recognised an exceptional impairment of \u00a330.5m on the Keadby gas fired power station due to a market shift in energy prices achievable from its thermal fleet. The movement in clean spark spreads was adverse for Keadby, however the same shift is considered favourable to the Group's newer and more efficient plant at Marchwood. As a result, the Group reversed prior impairments of \u00a327.8m against Marchwood power station, which is classified as a right of use asset.\n\n## (ii)  Disposal costs - SSE Energy Services\n\nAt 31 March 2019 the Group's UK domestic supply business was presented as held for disposal and as a result the Group incurred restructuring costs and recognised provisions for costs that will be incurred on completion of the disposal. In the year the Group incurred non-cash impairment charges of \u00a341.0m on certain properties that have subsequently been sub-let to SSE Energy Services at a rate of rent that will not support the current carrying value of the assets. In addition, the Group incurred a further \u00a347.9m of professional advisor fees and IT and physical separation costs related to the disposal.\n\n## (iii)  Pensions GMP equalisation\n\nOn 26 October 2018, the High Court finalised a judgement in the case of Lloyds Banking Group Pensions Trustees Limited vs. Lloyds Bank plc. As a result, the Group has recognised an exceptional past service cost of \u00a39.0m in the 31 March 2019 income statement for guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) equalisation across the schemes. The exceptional charge is 0.22% of the Group's pension liabilities as at 31 March 2019. In addition, the Group's joint venture SGN recognised an exceptional past service charge of \u00a30.8m, of which the Group recognised its share of \u00a30.3m as exceptional.\n\n## Charges within discontinued operations\n\nWithin its discontinued SSE Energy Services segment, the Group recorded an exceptional impairment charge of \u00a354.3m related to discontinued marketing and customer data management software assets. The Group also recognised a net impairment reversal of \u00a329.7m related to its Gas Production assets following an increase in independently assessed hydrocarbon reserves and an increase to long term gas price forecasts. The impairment reversals were recognised on the Bacton (\u00a315.8m) and Sean (\u00a313.9m) fields due to the revision of reserves. Following these impairment reversals, the residual value in the Group's gas production assets at 31 March 2019 was \u00a3488.6m.",

        "page_content": "## 7.  Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.2  Certain re-measurements\n\nThe Group, through its EPM business, enters into forward commodity purchase (and sales) contracts to meet the future demand requirements of its Business Energy and Airtricity supply businesses and to optimise the value of its Renewable, Thermal Generation, and (discontinued) Gas Production assets. Certain of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9 are accounted for as 'own use' contracts. In addition, inventory purchased to utilise excess capacity ahead of an optimised sale in the market by the Gas Storage business is held as trading inventory at fair value.\n\nChanges in the fair value through the profit and loss statement of those commodity contracts designated as financial instruments and trading inventory are therefore reflected in the income statement. The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts and trading inventory separately - as 'certain re-measurements' - as the Group does not believe this mark-to-market movement is relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.\n\nThe Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts and inventory as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months. The re-measurements arising from IFRS 9 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\nThis category also includes the income statement movement on financing derivatives (and hedged items) as described in Note 24.\n\n## 7.3  Change in UK corporation tax rates\n\nThe Government announced in the Budget on 3 March 2021 that the main rate of corporation tax will increase to 25% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2023. Prior to this date, the rate of corporation tax will remain at 19%. The increase to 25% rate was not substantively enacted at 31 March 2021, therefore the Group has continued to measure deferred tax balances at 19%. The Group has estimated that the increase to 25% would increase the Group's deferred tax liabilities by \u00a3229.4m.\n\nFinance Bill 2021 also included draft legislation in respect of Capital Allowance 'Super-deductions' of 130% in respect of General Pool plant and machinery, alongside First Year Allowances of 50% for Special Rate Pool plant and machinery for the two years commencing 1 April 2021. The Group expects these changes, which have not yet been enacted, to significantly increase the deduction for Capital Allowances in the financial years ending 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023. It is not yet possible to quantify the financial impact of these changes as guidance has yet to be issued by HMRC as to how they will apply.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Group has separately recognised the tax effect of the exceptional items and certain re-measurements summarised above.\n\n## 8.

Taxation continued\n\n## 10.1  Analysis of charge recognised in the income statement continued\n\nThe Group has separately recognised the tax effect of the exceptional items and certain re-measurements summarised above. The rate change to 25% in respect of periods commencing after 1 April 2023 included in Finance Bill 2021 has not been included in the closing balance, as it has not been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nSSE continues to be accredited with the Fair Tax Mark. As a consequence, these financial statements include a number of areas of enhanced disclosure which have been provided in order to develop stakeholder understanding of the tax the Group pays and the reported total taxation charge along with additional commentary on the main reconciling items.\n\nThese can be seen at section A2 \uf150\n\n.\n\nThe majority of the Group's profits are earned in the UK, with the standard rate of UK corporation tax being 19% for the year to 31 March 2021 (2020: 19%). The Group's Gas Production business, which is included within discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2021 (and 31 March 2020), is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% (combined 40%). Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.\n\nThe 'adjusted current tax charge' and the 'adjusted effective rate of tax', which are presented in order to best represent underlying performance by making similar adjustments to the 'adjusted profit before tax' measure, are arrived at after the following adjustments:\n\n| Continuing operations                                   | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2021  %   | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2020  %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| Group tax charge and effective rate                     | 224.3      | 9.4       | 121.5      | 28.0      |\n| Add: reported deferred tax charge and effective rate    | (145.4)    | (6.1)     | ( 67.4)    | (15.5)    |\n| Reported current tax charge and effective rate          | 78.9       | 3.3       | 54.1       | 12.5      |\n| Effect of adjusting items                               |            | 4.1       |            | ( 7. 2)   |\n| Reported current tax charge on adjusted basis           | 78.9       | 7.4       | 54.1       | 5.3       |\n| add:                                                    |            |           |            |           |\n| Share of current tax from joint ventures and associates | 36.8       | 3.5       | 36.7       | 3.6       |\n| less:                                                   |            |           |            |           |\n| Current tax credit on exceptional items                 | ( 7. 9)    | (0.8)     | 23.4       | 2.3       |\n| Adjusted current tax charge and effective rate          | 107.8      | 10.1      | 114.2      | 11.2      |\n\nTax charge/(credit) recognised in other comprehensive income/(loss):\n\n|                                                                 | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Relating to:                                                    |            |           |\n| Pension scheme actuarial movements                              | (3.1)      | (89.5)    |\n| Cash flow and net investment hedge movements                    | (9.9)      | 7. 3      |\n| Other                                                           | (1.7)      | -         |\n| Deferred tax charge related to historic depreciation adjustment | -          | 6.4       |\n|                                                                 | (14.7)     | (75.8)    |\n\nAll tax recognised through other comprehensive income is deferred tax.\n\nSee further Taxation disclosures at A2 \uf150 .",

Taxation continued\n\n|                                   |   2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Corporation tax liability/(asset) |       0.1 | (15.1)    |\n\n## 10.2  Current tax liabilities\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group invests heavily in infrastructure, on which significant amounts of capital allowances are potentially available. The extent to which capital allowances are available on any single asset is, however, very much dependent upon the fact pattern for the asset involved, and there will often be an element of uncertainty as to how capital allowances legislation applies in those circumstances. Reaching agreement with tax authorities as to the amount of capital allowances available can take a number of years, and sometimes can only be resolved through a formal legal process.\n\nThe calculation of the Group's total tax charge therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in relation to certain items for which the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the tax authorities or, if required, through a formal legal process. At 31 March 2021, the Group has recognised provisions totalling \u00a337.6m in respect of uncertain tax positions, primarily in relation to the availability of capital allowances (2020: \u00a339.4m). The Group estimates that a reasonably possible range of settlement outcomes for the uncertain tax positions could be in the range from nil to the full value of the provision, due to the binary nature of the decision as to whether capital allowances are available or not.\n\nDue to the uncertainty associated with such tax positions, it is possible that at a future date, and on conclusion of these open tax positions, the final outcomes may vary significantly. While a range of outcomes is reasonably possible, the Group continues to believe that it has made appropriate provision for periods which are open and not yet agreed with the tax authorities.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group's case concerning the availability of capital allowances on Glendoe Hydro Electric Station was heard at the Court of Appeal. A decision was released in February 2021, which was largely in the Group's favour. HMRC have sought permission to have an appeal heard against the decision by the Supreme Court, with the Supreme Court being expected to decide whether they are prepared to hear an appeal by mid-2021. Any movement in the amounts carried for other uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months will be driven by tax litigation the Group is not directly involved in and is unable to predict the outcome of.\n\n## 10.3  Deferred taxation\n\nThe following are the deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods:\n\n|                                                                 | Accelerated  capital  allowances \u00a3m   | Fair value gains/ (losses) on   derivatives   \u00a3m   | Retirement  benefit  obligations \u00a3m   | Other  \u00a3m   | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| At 31 March 2019                                                | 771.9                                 | (161.3)                                            | 145.7                                 | (144.7)     | 611.6        |\n| Opening balance sheet adjustment on IFRS 16 adoption            | (4.8)                                 | -                                                  | -                                     | -           | (4.8)        |\n| (Credit)/charge to Income Statement on continuing  operations   | 86.6                                  | (21.3)                                             | 6.0                                   | (3.8)       | 67.5         |\n| (Credit)/charge to Income Statement on discontinued  operations | (96.4)                                | -                                                  | 2.8                                   | 102.5       | 8.9          |\n| (Credit)/charge to equity                                       | 6.4                                   | 7. 2                                               | (89.5)                                | 0.1         | (75.8)       |\n| (Credit)/charge recognised on disposal                          | (9.4)                                 | 34.8                                               | -                                     | (1.5)       | 23.9         |\n| Transferred to held for sale                                    | (49.8)                                | -                                                  | -                                     | 64.3        | 14.5         |\n| At 31 March 2020                                                | 704.5                                 | (140.6)                                            | 65.0                                  | 16.9        | 645.8        |\n| (Credit)/charge to Income Statement on continuing  operations   | 13.5                                  | 119.0                                              | 5.9                                   | 7.0         | 145.4        |\n| (Credit)/Charge to equity                                       | -                                     | (3.7)                                              | (3.1)                                 | (1.7)       | (8.5)        |\n| (Credit)/charge recognised on disposal                          | (0.2)                                 | -                                                  | -                                     | (5.7)       | (5.9)        |\n| Transfers                                                       | 15.8                                  | -                                                  | -                                     | (15.8)      | -            |\n| Transferred to held for sale                                    | -                                     | -                                                  | -                                     | -           | 0.2          |\n| Exchange adjustments                                            | -                                     | -                                                  | -                                     | (2.7)       | (2.7)        |\n| At 31 March 2021                                                | 733.8                                 | (25.3)                                             | 67.8                                  | (2.0)       | 774.3        |",

Taxation continued\n\n## 10.3  Deferred taxation continued\n\nCertain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed in the tables above. The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:\n\n|                                       | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred tax liabilities              | 801.6     | 786.4     |\n| Deferred tax assets                   | (27.3)    | (140.6)   |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities/(assets) | 774.3     | 645.8     |\n\nThe deferred tax assets disclosed include the deferred tax relating to the Group's net pension scheme asset.\n\nIn total there are \u00a3103.5m (2020: \u00a396.6m) of unrecognised deferred tax assets. The Group has not recognised an asset of \u00a351.6m (2020: \u00a347.7m) in respect of \u00a3171.8m (2020: \u00a3159.0m) of losses under Ring Fence Corporation Tax and has not recognised an asset of \u00a310.3m (2020: \u00a38.2m) in respect of \u00a3103.0m (2020: \u00a381.7m) of Supplementary Corporation Tax losses. Further, the Group has not recognised \u00a335.4m (2020: \u00a335.1m) on activated investment allowances of \u00a3354.0m (2020: \u00a3351.3m) primarily in respect of the Greater Laggan Area fields and an asset of \u00a36.2m (2020: \u00a35.6m) on trading losses of \u00a349.6m (2020: \u00a344.6m) in the Republic of Ireland. These assets have not been recognised as the Group is uncertain that there will be sufficient future profits against which to utilise the assets. There is no time limit for expiry of the losses or allowances to which they relate.\n\nNo deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Total unremitted earnings at 31 March 2021 were \u00a3281.5m (2020: \u00a3381.4m).\n\n## 11.

Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the cash dividend under the terms of the Company's scrip dividend scheme. The Group had previously stated that where the take-up of the scrip dividend scheme exceeded 20% of the total dividend payment, the Group would repurchase shares to reduce the scrip's dilutive effects. In order to maintain capital reserves following the occurrence of the coronavirus pandemic, the Group will no longer repurchase shares when the scrip take-up exceeds 20%.\n\nAn interim dividend of 24.4p per ordinary share (2020: 24.0p) was declared and paid on 11 March 2021 to those shareholders on the SSE plc share register on 15 January 2021. Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the interim cash dividend under the terms of the Company's scrip dividend scheme.\n\nThe proposed final dividend of 56.6p per ordinary share based on the number of issued ordinary shares at 31 March 2021 is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. Based on shares in issue at 31 March 2021, this would equate to a final dividend of \u00a3590.4m.",

Dividends and earnings per share continued\n\n## 11.2  Basic and adjusted earnings per share\n\nThe calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share at 31 March 2021 is based on the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest on net pension liabilities under IAS 19, the depreciation charged on fair value uplifts and the impact of exceptional items and certain re-measurements (Note 7).\n\n|                                                                               | 2021 Earnings \u00a3m   | 2021 Earnings per  share pence   | 2020 Earnings \u00a3m   | 2020 Earnings per  share pence   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Continuing operations                                                         |                    |                                  |                    |                                  |\n| Earnings/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders                         | 2,276.2            | 218.7                            | (59.0)             | (5.7)                            |\n| Less: earnings attributable to discontinued operations                        | (30.7)             | (3.0)                            | 478.6              | 46.3                             |\n| Basic earnings on continuing operations used to calculate adjusted EPS        | 2,245.5            | 215.7                            | 419.6              | 40.6                             |\n| Exceptional items and certain re-measurements (Note 7)                        | (1,382.5)          | (132.8)                          | 327.1              | 31.7                             |\n| Basic excluding exceptional items and certain re-measurements                 | 863.0              | 82.9                             | 746.7              | 72.3                             |\n| Adjusted for:                                                                 |                    |                                  |                    |                                  |\n| Share of non-recurring joint venture refinancing costs                        | -

Acquisitions, disposals and held for sale assets\n\n## 12.1  Acquisitions\n\nThere have been no significant acquisitions in the current or prior year.\n\n## 12.2  Disposals\n\n## (i)  Significant disposals\n\n## Current year disposals\n\nDuring the year the Group progressed with its disposal plan for non-core assets announced in June 2020, and continued its programme of strategic partnering generating developer gains. As a result, it recognised an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3976.0m (see Note 7) and a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3251.9m. The disposals below primarily comprise sales of stakes in non-operated investment assets, or the sale of a stake in early stage offshore windfarm developments, which aligns to the Group's stated policy to realise value from these assets.\n\nSale of investment in Ferrybridge Multifuel: On 13 October 2020, the Group announced it had reached an agreement to dispose of its 50% joint venture investment in Multifuel Energy Limited and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (together 'MEL'), to European Diversified Infrastructure Fund III for headline consideration of \u00a3995m. The agreement was subject to antitrust approval by the European Commission, which was granted on 7 January 2021 when the transaction completed. The Group recorded an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3669.9m on completion.\n\nSale of investment in Walney Windfarm: On 2 September 2020, the Group agreed to sell its subsidiary, SSE Renewables Walney Limited, to Greencoat UK Wind Plc for consideration of \u00a3350m, resulting in an exceptional gain on sale of \u00a3188.7m. SSE Renewables Walney Limited was the holding company of the Group's non-operated 25.1% joint venture stake in Walney Offshore Windfarm. As essentially a financial investment and as Walney Offshore Wind Farm Limited has been operational for several years, the disposal is not considered to be aligned to the Group's strategic objective of gaining value from divestment of stakes in offshore or international wind developments, therefore the gain on disposal has been recognised as exceptional.\n\nSale of investment in Maple Smart Meter Assets: On 23 September 2020, the Group disposed of its 33% joint venture investment in Maple Topco Limited, the smart meter services provider, for proceeds of \u00a395.3m, recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a370.4m.\n\nSale of stake in Doggerbank A&B Windfarms: On 4 December 2020, the Group announced it had agreed to sell a 10% stake in Doggerbank A and Doggerbank B windfarms to Eni for equity consideration of \u00a3206.3m, including an interest adjustment of \u00a33.8m, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3202.8m. The gain has been recognised within the adjusted profit of the Group in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy for gains on disposal of divestments in offshore windfarms (see Note 3.2).\n\nOn the same date, Eni entered into an agreement with Equinor to purchase a further 10% stake in the development. Following these transactions, SSE and Equinor each hold a 40% equity stake and Eni a 20% stake. Doggerbank C remains a 50:50 joint venture between SSE and Equinor.\n\nSale of stake in Seagreen 1 Windfarm: On 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Seagreen Holdco 1 Ltd ('Seagreen 1'), to Total. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a370m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a360m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Seagreen 1 should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a349.0m. Of that gain, \u00a325.7m has been recognised as exceptional, as it represents the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a323.3m of the gain has been included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see Note 3.2).\n\nSale of stake in Slough Multifuel: On 2 April 2020, the Group disposed of a 50% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, SSE Slough Multifuel Ltd, to Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a310m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a359.1m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Slough Multifuel should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a341.7m. Of that gain, \u00a321.3m has been recognised as exceptional, as it represents the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a320.4m of the gain has been included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see Note 3.2).\n\n## Prior year disposals\n\nSSE Energy Services: On 15 January 2020 the Group completed the disposal of its household energy and services business in Great Britain ('SSE Energy Services') to Ovo Group Limited ('Ovo'). The agreement, which was announced on 13 September 2019, was based on a 'locked box' transaction mechanism with an effective economic date of 30 June 2019. The enterprise value agreed was \u00a3500m, comprising \u00a3400m cash and \u00a3100m in 13.25% unsecured Loan Notes due 2029, less an adjustment for debt-like items of \u00a359.9m. The Group first classified SSE Energy Services as held for disposal in its 30 September 2018 Interim Statement.",

Commentary on the impairment testing of the related CGUs, with the exception of two historic balances totalling \u00a38.2m, is included in Note 15.\n\nA summary of the goodwill allocated to CGUs and the Group's operating segments is presented below:\n\n| Cash-generating unit   | Operating Segment            |   2021  \u00a3m |   2020  \u00a3m |\n|------------------------|------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Onshore windfarms      | SSE Renewables               |       73.7 |       79.5 |\n| Offshore windfarms     | SSE Renewables               |      214.9 |      214.9 |\n| Energy Solutions 1     | Business Energy & Enterprise |       32.4 |       38.3 |\n| Ireland Supply 2       | Airtricity                   |        8.2 |        8.2 |\n|                        |                              |      329.2 |      340.9 |\n\n## (ii)  Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and Certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates (ROCs). These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Group's Generation and Business Energy supply business, and are therefore distinct from allowances and certificates in excess of the Group's environmental obligations which are recorded within inventories.",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## (iii)  Development assets\n\nDevelopment costs relate to the design, construction and testing of Thermal and Renewable generation sites, which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits. Costs capitalised as development intangibles include options over land rights, planning application costs, environmental impact studies and other costs incurred in bringing windfarms and other Renewable and Thermal generation and network development projects to the consented stage. These may be costs incurred directly or at a cost as part of the fair value attribution on acquisition.\n\nAt the point the development reaches the consent stage and is approved for construction, the carrying value is transferred to Property, Plant and Equipment (Note 14). At the point a project is no longer expected to reach the consented stage, the carrying amount of the project is impaired.\n\n## (iv)  Other intangible assets\n\nIncluded within other intangible assets are brands, customer lists and contracts.\n\nNo exceptional or non-exceptional impairment charges have been recognised in the year (2020: \u00a3nil).\n\n## (v)  Software assets\n\nSoftware assets include application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software packages.\n\nExceptional charges of \u00a35.2m (2020: \u00a348.8m) have been recognised in relation to the disposal of SSE Energy Services (recognised within continuing operations) (Note 7). In the prior year non-exceptional charges of \u00a39.8m were recognised due to the identification of obsolete software assets.",

Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and intangibles that are not amortised are reviewed at least annually for impairment and PPE and other intangibles are assessed annually for impairment triggers.\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and methodologies for impairment testing are described at Accompanying Information sections A1.2 \uf150 .\n\nThe key operating and valuation assumptions, specific considerations and outcome of tests for all impairment reviews are noted in the following sections. The discount rates used are pre-tax real, except where noted, and reflect specific risks attributable to the relevant operating segments. The discount rates applied in both 2021 and 2020 remain consistent across all CGUs, except where noted, reflecting the Group's view of cost of capital and risk. The recoverable amounts derived from the VIU or FVLCS calculations are compared to the carrying amount of each asset or CGU to determine whether an impairment charge requires to be recognised. The reviews carried out for the 2021 financial statements were carried out in the fourth quarter of the year, which is consistent with previous reviews. Note that the actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions included in the assessments at the balance sheet date.",

Impairment testing continued\n\n## 15.2  PP&E, other intangibles and investment impairment reviews - asset testing\n\nWhere an indicator of impairment exists, the recoverable amounts of the Group's PP&E, other intangible assets and interests in joint ventures and associates are determined by reference to VIU calculations. The calculations use, as their starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Group's five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board. The Group's Corporate Model is based on past experience and reflects the Group's forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives. Commodity prices used are based on observable market data and, where this is not available, on internal estimates.\n\n## Changes from prior year\n\nIn the prior year the Group assessed that its Great Island CCGT plant did not display indicators of impairment following good operational performance from the asset and limited uncertainty following the implementation of the Isle of Ireland Integrated Single Electricity Market ('I-SEM') in October 2018. During the current year the asset has performed slightly below expectation. However, in the year to 31 March 2021, valuation of the asset has noted lower demand forecasts and a projection of lower infra-marginal rent from the asset in future years. These factors have been considered a trigger for an impairment review and the asset has been included in the 31 March 2021 impairment assessment below.\n\nCash flow period\n\nOperating and other\n\n| Assets                                                                                     | assumption                            | valuation assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Commentary and impairment conclusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GB CCGTs  (Keadby,  Medway,  Peterhead  and  Marchwood  (PPA Right  of use lease  stations | asset) power  Period to   end of life | Modelling methodology and  assumptions The VIU of the Group's GB  combined cycle gas turbine  ('CCGT') power stations were  based on pre-tax discounted   cash flows expected to be  generated by each plant, based on  management's view of operating  prospects and operational  flexibility within the GB wholesale  market, including capacity market  clearing prices. Cash flows are  subject to a pre-tax real discount  rate between 8.9% and 19.9%  (2020: between 7.7% and 12.6%). Changes from prior year | Conclusion At 31 March 2021 no impairment, or impairment reversal, has been  recognised on each of the GB CCGT assets.  The impairment assessment returned individually non-significant  impairments to Peterhead (\u00a33.1m) and Marchwood (\u00a31.5m), and  individually non-significant impairment reversals to Keadby (\u00a34.6m)   and Medway (\u00a34.7m). The Group judged that it was appropriate not to  recognise any discrete impairment charges or reversals, as reasonably  possible scenarios modelled through the sensitivity analysis included  outcomes of impairments and impairment reversals on each asset.  Sensitivity analysis A 20% decrease in gross margin would result in impairments to each asset.  Medway would be impaired by \u00a36.2m; Keadby by \u00a33.9m; Marchwood PPA  lease asset by \u00a336.8m; and Peterhead by \u00a331.1m.

Further detail on the Group's disposals in the year is provided in Note 12.2 and is summarised below.\n\n## Additions in the year arising on loss on control\n\nSale of Slough Multifuel subsidiary and acquisition of joint venture investment: On 2 April 2020, the Group disposed of a 50% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, SSE Slough Multifuel Ltd, to Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (see Note 12.2). The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the remaining 50% investment in Slough Multifuel should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value of \u00a331.3m under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on that date.\n\nSale of Seagreen 1 subsidiary and acquisition of investment: On 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Seagreen Holdco 1 Ltd ('Seagreen 1'), to Total (see Note 12.2). The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the remaining 49% investment in Seagreen 1 should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value of \u00a367.2m under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on that date.\n\n## Disposals of equity in the year\n\nSale of investment in Ferrybridge Multifuel: On 13 October 2020, the Group announced it had reached an agreement to dispose of its 50% joint venture investment in Multifuel Energy Limited and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (together 'MEL'), to European Diversified Infrastructure Fund III for headline consideration of \u00a3995m. The agreement was subject to antitrust approval by the European Commission, which was granted on 7 January 2021 when the transaction completed. The Group recorded an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3669.9m on completion.\n\nSale of investment in Walney Windfarm: On 2 September 2020, the Group agreed to sell its subsidiary, SSE Renewables Walney Limited, to Greencoat UK Wind Plc for consideration of \u00a3350m, resulting in an exceptional gain on sale of \u00a3188.7m. SSE Renewables Walney Limited was the holding company of the Group's non-operated 25.1% joint venture stake in Walney Offshore Windfarm.\n\nSale of investment in Maple Smart Meter Assets: On 23 September 2020, the Group disposed of its 33% joint venture investment in Maple Topco Limited, the smart meter services provider, for proceeds of \u00a395.3m, recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a370.4m.\n\nSale of stake in Doggerbank A&B Windfarms: On 4 December 2020, the Group announced it had agreed to sell a 10% stake in Doggerbank A and Doggerbank B windfarms to Eni for equity consideration of \u00a3206.3m, including an interest adjustment of \u00a33.8m, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3202.8m. The gain has been recognised within the adjusted profit of the Group in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy for gains on disposal of divestments in offshore windfarms (see Note 3).\n\nOn the same date, Eni entered into an agreement with Equinor to purchase a further 10% stake in the development. Following these transactions, SSE and Equinor each hold a 40% equity stake and Eni a 20% stake. Doggerbank C remains a 50:50 joint venture between SSE and Equinor.",

The loan note carries interest of 13.25% and is presented cumulative of accrued interest repayments, discounted at 13.25%.\n\nUnbilled energy income represents an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. Detail of the calculation applied to estimate this balance is included at Note 4.1(iii). The Group estimates the value of residual electricity consumption uncertainty at the year end is plus or minus \u00a34m (2020: plus or minus \u00a34m).\n\nContract related assets comprise amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the right to consideration is contingent on a performance obligation other than the passage of time. The Group has therefore recognised a contract asset for any work performed where payment is not yet due. The Group has assessed that the disclosures required under IFRS 15 to reconcile and explain opening and closing contract assets are immaterial for the Group financial statements.\n\nOther receivables include financial assets totalling \u00a33.8m (2020: \u00a36.3m). Cash held as collateral relates to amounts deposited on commodity trading exchanges of \u00a32.7m (2020: \u00a3256.4m).\n\nTrade receivables and other financial assets are part of the Group's financial exposure to credit risk as explained in accompanying information Note A6.\n\n## 19.

Sources of finance\n\n## 21.1  Capital management\n\nThe Board's policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit rating to support investor, counterparty and market confidence in the Group and to underpin future development of the business. The Group's credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in determining collateral requirements throughout the Group. As at 31 March 2021, the Group's long-term credit rating was BBB+ stable outlook for Standard & Poor's and Baa1 negative outlook for Moody's.\n\nThe maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Group's capital structure and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing. Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Group's credit ratings.\n\nThe Group's debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium term bank loans including those with the European Investment Bank. During the year to 31 March 2021, the SSE Group successfully accessed the debt capital markets on three occasions, taking \u00a32.5bn out the market over four senior debt tranches and two Hybrid debt securities tranches.",

Sources of finance continued\n\n## 21.1  Capital management continued\n\n- \u00b7 In April 2020 SSE plc successfully launched a \u20ac1.1bn 5-year and 10-year dual tranche Eurobond with \u20ac600m maturing April 2025 and \u20ac500m maturing April 2030, with coupons of 1.25% and 1.75% respectively. Both tranches have been swapped to Sterling resulting in a funding cost of 2.4% for the five year and 2.9% for the 10 year.\n- \u00b7 In July 2020, SSE plc issued a dual tranche equity accounted hybrid bond to replace the hybrids issued in 2015 (at an all-in rate of 4.02%), which had issuer first call dates of 10 September 2020 (\u00a3750m) and 1 April 2021 (\u20ac600m). This dual tranche issue comprises a perpetual non-call 5.75-year note at \u00a3600m with a coupon of 3.74%; and a perpetual non-call 7.0-year note at \u20ac500m with a coupon of 3.125%. The \u20ac500m tranche has been partly swapped back to Sterling, resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of just under 3.8% per annum.\n- \u00b7 In March 2021, SSEN Transmission issued a new \u00a3500m dual tranche green bond being a 7-year bond with a coupon of 1.50% and a 15-year bond with a coupon of 2.125%. This was our fourth green bond in five years and reaffirmed our status as the largest issuer of green bonds in the FTSE 100. At the same time, we set out a new framework for issuing innovative sustainability-linked bonds in the future.\n\nSSE has \u00a31.5bn of committed bank facilities in place to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity to allow day-to -day operations and investment programmes to continue in the event of disruption to capital markets preventing SSE from issuing new debt for a period of time. These facilities are a \u00a31.3bn revolving credit facility with a March 2026 maturity and a \u00a3200m bilateral facility with an October 2025 maturity and an option to extend for a further year to October 2026. The facilities can also be utilised to cover short-term funding requirements; however, they remain undrawn for most of the time and at 31 March 2021 they were both undrawn. Both facilities are classified as sustainable facilities with interest rate and fees paid dependant on SSE's performance in environmental, social and governance matters, as assessed independently by Vigeo Eiris.\n\nThe Group capital comprises:\n\n|                                                    | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Total borrowings (excluding lease obligations)     | 8,989.6    | 9,717.2    |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                    | (1,600.2)  | (164.6)    |\n| Net debt (excluding hybrid equity)                 | 7,389.4    | 9,552.6    |\n| Hybrid equity                                      | 1,472.4    | 1,169.7    |\n| Cash held as collateral and other short-term loans | 37.1       | (256.4)    |\n| Adjusted Net Debt and Hybrid Equity                | 8,898.9    | 10,465.9   |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent  | 5,208.7    | 3,750.4    |\n| Total capital excluding lease obligations          | 14,107.6   | 14,216.3   |\n\nUnder the terms of its major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenant:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Cover Ratio: The Group shall procure that the ratio of Operating Profit to Net Interest Payable for any relevant period is not less than 2.5 to 1.\n\nThe following definitions apply in the calculation of these financial covenants:\n\n- \u00b7 'Operating Profit' means, in relation to a relevant period, the profit on ordinary activities before taxation (after adding back Net Interest Payable) of the Group for that relevant period but after adjusting this amount to exclude any exceptional profits (or losses) and, for the avoidance of doubt, before taking account of any exceptional profits (or losses) and excluding the effect of IFRS 9 remeasurements.\n- \u00b7 'Net Interest Payable' means, in respect of any relevant period, interest payable during that relevant period less interest receivable during that relevant period.\n\nIn summary, the Group's intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth. In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently. There were no changes to the Group's capital management approach during the year.",

The cash and cash equivalents are higher year on year due to a higher surplus cash position at March 2021 as a result of disposal proceeds and proceeds from the \u00a3500m debt issue in March 2021.\n\n## 21.3  Borrowing facilities\n\nThe Group has an established \u20ac1.5bn Euro commercial paper programme and as at 31 March 2021 there was no commercial paper outstanding (2020: \u00a3672.4m). The Group also has \u00a31.5bn of revolving credit facilities (see Note 21.1). These facilities continue to provide back-up to the commercial paper programme and, as at 31 March 2021 these facilities were undrawn.\n\nDuring the year to 31 March 2021, as referred at Note 21.1, the SSE Group successfully accessed the debt markets on three occasions raising \u00a32.5bn from the market over four senior debt tranches and two hybrid equity securities tranches.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\n## 21.  Sources of finance continued\n\n## 21.3  Borrowing facilities continued\n\n## Analysis of borrowings continued\n\nNote: The Sterling-equivalent fair value reflects the fair value of non-Sterling denominated borrowings, post the impact of the hedges noted below.\n\n- (i) Balances include term loans and EIB debt and is a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt.\n- (ii) Balances include Commercial Paper and facility advances.\n- (iii)  The fair value adjustment relates to the change in the carrying amount of the borrowings as a result of fair value hedges that are in place. The movement in the fair value adjustment is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding movement on the hedging instrument also being recognised in the income statement.\n- (iv)  The weighted average interest rates (including the effect of interest rate swaps) for the year ended 31 March 2021 was 3.12% (2020 - 3.18%).\n- (v)  The 2.375% \u20ac500m Eurobond maturing 10 February 2022 has been swapped to Sterling giving an effective interest rate of 3.53%.\n\n- (vii) The 1.375% \u20ac650m Eurobond maturing 4 September 2027 has been swapped to Sterling giving an effective interest rate of 2.56%.\n- (viii)  The 4.75% $900m NC5.5 Hybrid maturing 16 September 2077 has been swapped to Euros ($605m) and Sterling ($295m) giving an effective interest rate of 2.25% and 3.29% respectively. This and the 3.625% NC5.5 Hybrid maturing 16 September 2077 are the Group's debt-accounted Hybrids, see (ii) below.\n\n- (x)  The 1.750% \u20ac500m eurobond maturing 16 April 2030 has been swapped to Sterling giving an effective interest rate of 2.89%.\n\n## (i)  Lease liabilities\n\nIFRS 16 was adopted in the prior year under the Modified Retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adopting the standard was recognised as an adjustment to the opening lease liability on 1 April 2019. The opening balance below at 1 April 2019 includes this transition adjustment.\n\nAmounts charged under lease arrangements are detailed within Note 6, and right of use assets recognised under lease arrangements are detailed within Note 14.\n\n\u00a3m\n\n| At 1 April 2019                       | 482.6   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Additions during the year             | 46.6    |\n| Disposals during the year             | ( 7. 5) |\n| Unwind of discount                    | 36.8    |\n| Repayment in the year                 | (103.3) |\n| At 31 March 2020                      | 455.2   |\n| Additions during the year             | 43.6    |\n| Disposals during the year             | ( 7. 9) |\n| Unwind of discount                    | 33.1    |\n| Repayment in the year                 | (100.8) |\n| Transfer to liabilities held for sale | (2.2)   |\n| At 31 March 2021                      | 421.0   |\n\nThe weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities during the year was 4.84% (2020: 4.56%). Incremental borrowing rates applied to individual lease additions in the year ranged between 4.01% to 5.06% (2020: 4.06% to 5.06%).\n\nThe Group has additional committed payments under short term and low value leases at 31 March 2021 of \u00a335.0m (2020: \u00a336.2m).\n\nThe maturity of future lease liabilities are as follows:\n\n|                                    | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| Within one year                    | 92.7       | 96.5      |\n| Between one and five years         | 262.1      | 303.4     |\n| After five years                   | 267.2      | 284.7     |\n|                                    | 622.0      | 684.6     |\n| Less: future finance charge        | (201.0)    | (229.4)   |\n| Present value of lease obligations | 421.0      | 455.2     |\n\n## (ii)  Hybrid debt\n\nOn 16 March 2017, the Group issued \u00a31.0bn of hybrid debt securities. The securities have an issuer first call date on 16 September 2022 and are able to be redeemed at the Group's discretion. This dual tranche issue comprises \u00a3300m with a coupon of 3.625% and $900m with a coupon of 4.75%. The $900m tranche was swapped back to both Euros and Sterling, bringing the all-in rate down to 2.72% and resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of 3.02% per annum. Due to these hybrid instruments having a fixed redemption date, they are accounted for as a debt item and are included within Loans and Other Borrowings in Note 21.2. This is in contrast to the Hybrid instruments issued in 2015 and 2020 which have no fixed redemption date and are accounted for as Equity, see Note 22.5.",

This resulted in the issue of 1,918,977 and 883,408 new fully paid ordinary shares respectively (2020: 19,086,291 and 9,136,089). In addition, the Company issued 0.9m (2020: 0.8m) shares during the year under the savings-related share option schemes (all of which were settled by shares held in Treasury) for a consideration of \u00a310.4m (2020: \u00a310.1m).",

The date for the first discretionary redemption of the \u20ac600m hybrid equity bond is 1 April 2021 and then every 5 years thereafter.\n\n## (ii)  2 July 2020 \u00a3600m and \u20ac500m Hybrid Capital Bonds\n\nThe new hybrid capital bonds issued in July 2020 have no fixed redemption date, but the Company may, at its sole discretion, redeem all but not part of the capital securities at their principal amount.

Deferred coupons shall be satisfied only in the following circumstances, all of which occur at the sole option of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 redemption; or\n- \u00b7 dividend payment on ordinary shares.\n\nInterest will accrue on any deferred coupon.",

Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group has two funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay. The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years. The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.\n\nThe Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme, SSE Pensions+ under a master trust with Aviva. The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%. The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five years and a further 3% after ten year's continuous Group service.\n\nThe Group presents its pension scheme valuations under two different measurement bases, an actuarial valuation and an IAS 19 valuation as required by accounting standards. The IAS 19 valuation is used to determine the assets and obligations recognised in the Group's consolidated balance sheet and is calculated annually by scheme actuaries, whereas the formal actuarial valuation is used to determine the contributions the Group make to the scheme. The actuarial valuation is recalculated for each scheme every three years.\n\n## Actuarial valuations\n\nThe individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows:\n\n|                                         | Scottish Hydro Electric   | Southern Electric   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| Latest formal actuarial valuation       | 31 March 2018             | 31 March 2019       |\n| Valuation carried out by                | Hymans Robertson          | Aon Hewitt          |\n| Value of assets based on valuation      | \u00a32,059.0m                 | \u00a32,257.8m           |\n| Value of liabilities based on valuation | \u00a31,902.3m                 | \u00a32,544.4m           |\n| Valuation method adopted                | Projected Unit            | Projected Unit      |\n| Average salary increase                 | RPI+1%                    | RPI+0.5%            |\n| Average pension increase                | RPI                       | RPI                 |\n| Value of fund assets/accrued benefits   | 108.2%                    | 88.7%               |\n\n## Future contributions\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme\n\nThe last actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2018 and showed a surplus of \u00a3156.7m on a projected unit basis. Following this valuation, the Group agreed to cease contributions to the scheme during the year ended 31 March 2020 for a period until the actuarial valuation of the scheme is in deficit for two consecutive quarterly valuations. Consequently, the Group is not expected to make contributions to the scheme in the year ending 31 March 2022. The next triennial funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2021. This process began during the year and is expected to be finalised by 30 September 2021. As part of that process the Trustee and Company will agree future contributions to the scheme based on the valuation.\n\n## Southern Electric Pension Scheme\n\nThe last actuarial valuation of the Scheme was finalised in the prior year and showed a deficit of \u00a3286.6m as at 31 March 2019 on a projected unit basis. The Group continues to pay deficit contributions which, along with investment returns from return-seeking assets, is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2027. The next funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2022. The Company also pays contributions in respect of current accrual, with some active members also paying contributions. Total contributions of approximately \u00a354.7m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2022, including deficit repair contributions of \u00a340.9m.\n\nPension summary as measured under IAS 19:\n\n|                           | Scheme type     | Net actuarial gain/(loss) recognised in  respect of the pension asset in the  Statement of Comprehensive Income   | Net actuarial gain/(loss) recognised in  respect of the pension asset in the  Statement of Comprehensive Income   | Net pension asset/(liability)   | Net pension asset/(liability)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                           |                 | 2021                                                                                                              | 2020                                                                                                              | 2021 \u00a3m                         | 2020                            |\n|                           |                 | \u00a3m                                                                                                                | \u00a3m                                                                                                                |                                 | \u00a3m                              |\n| Scottish Hydro Electric   | Defined benefit | 8.6                                                                                                               | (2.8)                                                                                                             | 543.1                           | 534.2                           |\n| Southern Electric         | Defined benefit | (24.4)                                                                                                            | 11.1                                                                                                              | (186.1)                         | (192.5)                         |\n| Net actuarial gain/(loss) |                 | (15.8)                                                                                                            | 8.3                                                                                                               | 357.0                           | 341.7                           |\n\n## IFRC 14 surplus restrictions\n\nThe value of Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme assets recognised was previously impacted by the asset ceiling test which restricts the surplus that can be recognised to assets that can be recovered through future refunds or reductions in future contributions to the schemes, and may increase the value of scheme liabilities where there are minimum funding liabilities in relation to agreed contributions. IFRIC 14 ' IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction ' clarifies that future refunds may be recognised if the sponsoring entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.",

Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Future contributions continued\n\nIn 2016/17 the Group agreed with the trustees to the Scottish Hydro Electric pensions scheme an amendment to the scheme rules to clarify that the Company has a clear right to any surplus upon final winding up of the scheme. This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus and as such the previously applied restriction is no longer recognised. The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2021 was equal to \u00a3543.1m (2020: \u00a3534.2m).\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Southern Electric Pension Scheme has a net deficit of \u00a3186.1m, and unrecognised future contributions of \u00a3224.9m, which when paid, will result in a notional surplus of \u00a338.8m. The Group has assessed that it has the right to recognise any future surpluses on the scheme, therefore has not recognised a liability for future unrecoverable contributions.\n\n## 23.1  pension scheme assumptions\n\nBoth schemes have been updated to 31 March 2021 by qualified independent actuaries. The valuations have been prepared for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19.

The assumptions, equivalent to future longevity for members in normal health at age 65, are as follows:\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric\n\n|                   | At 31 March 2021   | At 31 March 2021   | At 31 March 2020   | At 31 March 2020   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                   | Male               | Female             | Male               | Female             |\n| Currently aged 65 | 23                 | 24                 | 23                 | 24                 |\n| Currently aged 45 | 25                 | 27                 | 24                 | 26                 |\n\n## Southern Electric\n\n|                   | At 31 March 2021   | At 31 March 2021   | At 31 March 2020   | At 31 March 2020   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                   | Male               | Female             | Male               | Female             |\n| Currently aged 65 | 23                 | 25                 | 23                 | 25                 |\n| Currently aged 45 | 24                 | 26                 | 24                 | 26                 |\n\n## 23.2  sensitivity analysis\n\nThe impact on the schemes' liabilities of changing certain of the major assumptions is as follows:\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric\n\n|                                          | At 31 March 2021                  | At 31 March 2021                 | At 31 March 2020                  | At 31 March 2020                 |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                          | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.2%                          |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 0.1%                              | +/-1.0%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                          |\n| Discount rate                            | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                          |\n| Longevity                                | 1 year                            | +/-1.8%                          | 1 year                            | +/-1.8%                          |\n\nDuring the prior year a longevity swap contract in the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme was converted to a 'buy-in' contract, reducing the Group's exposure to fluctuations in the calculation of the obligation (see Note 23.6).\n\n## Southern Electric\n\n|                                          | At 31 March 2021                  | At 31 March 2021                 | At 31 March 2020                  | At 31 March 2020                 |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                          | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 0.1%                              | +/-0.2%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.2%                          |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 0.1%                              | +/-1.5%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-1.6%                          |\n| Discount rate                            | 0.1%                              | +/-1.6%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-1.7%                          |\n| Longevity                                | 1 year                            | +/-6.0%                          | 1 year                            | +/-4.4%                          |",

The equalisation is a point estimate calculated under the C2 method of equalisation with no limit on the period of arrears. During the current year, a further court case was heard which ruled that all transfers with GMPs built up between 17 May 1990 and 5 April 1997 would also need to be equalised.

Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## 23.5  Pension scheme risk assessment and mitigation\n\n## Risks to which the Pension Schemes exposes the Group\n\nThe nature of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the schemes in times of adverse experience. The most financially significant risks are likely to be:\n\n## (i)  Asset volatility\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes' long term objectives.\n\n## (ii)  Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes' liabilities for accounting purposes. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings and its interest rate hedging.\n\n## (iii)  Inflation Risk\n\nThe majority of the schemes' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.\n\n## (iv)  Life Expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes' liabilities of the risks highlighted.\n\n## (v)  Liability vs asset risk\n\nThe risk that movement in the value of the schemes' liabilities are not met by corresponding movements in the value of the schemes' assets will expose the Group to movements in the overall funding surplus.\n\n## 23.6  Risk mitigation\n\n## (i)  De-risking\n\nThe Trustees have taken a number of steps to control the level of investment risk including reducing the Schemes' exposures to higher risk assets and increasing the level of protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation. The Trustees of both schemes continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the respective schemes. Detailed below are further details on the hedging of pensioner longevity risk.\n\n## (ii)  Asset buy-in\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme entered into an asset buy-in, transferring the risk of volatility in the assumptions used to calculate the obligation for 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependents (covering c\u00a3800m of the scheme's liabilities) to a third party. The asset buy-in is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy. This is in addition to a previous buy-in completed during the year ended 31 March 2018 when c\u00a3250m of the scheme's assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependents were transferred to a third party. The Group has now insured against volatility in obligations related to all pensioners to third parties (insurer PIC) and is now only exposed to valuation fluctuations related to active and deferred members.\n\n## (iii)  Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme\n\nThe Company and trustees of the schemes have agreed a long term investment strategy that seeks to reduce investment risk as and when appropriate. The asset-liability matching strategy is part of this approach which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension schemes by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the schemes so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected. This has been adopted for a proportion of the schemes' assets, which is designed to provide partial protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation. The trustees of the respective schemes review the schemes' asset allocation on an ongoing basis in light of changes in the funding position and market opportunities.",

While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.\n\n## (iii)  Asset recognition\n\nThe Group has recognised net pension assets in relation to the Scottish Hydro Electric pension scheme due to a surplus existing under IAS 19 accounting. The Group will only recognise a surplus should it have rights to that surplus under the rules of the pension scheme. The company no longer applies the 'asset ceiling' restriction mandated by IFRIC 14. Details on this key accounting consideration are provided above.\n\n## (iv)  Fair value assessment of scheme assets\n\nThe Group seeks to assess whether there is a quotable market value (referenced as 'quotable' above) in relation to pension scheme assets held. This assessment is based on regular reviews conducted in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes. For assets where no quotable market value exists, these assets will be valued based on a set methodology agreed by trustees and scheme advisors and then regularly assessed.\n\nCurrently only one unquotable value exists within the two pension schemes of the Group, this being insurance contracts (or 'buy-in') held by the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme. These assets are currently valued consistently with the scheme's liabilities with the expected return on these assets being set equal to the discount rate.",

In practice contractual variations may arise on the final settlement of these contractual costs. The increase in commitments year on year is mainly attributable to the contracted commitments for the Viking Windfarm and the Shetland HVDC transmission link.\n\n## 25.2  Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group has no unrecognised contingent assets at 31 March 2021 (2020: nil).\n\nContingent liabilities for the Group solely relate to SSE plc, and have been disclosed within Note 12 to the Company Financial Statements.\n\n## 26.  Post balance sheet events\n\n## (i)  Sale of SSE Contracting\n\nOn 1 April 2021, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group agreed to sell its Enterprise Contracting and Rail and business to Aurelius Group for initial consideration of \u00a317.5m; plus a \u00a35m loan note bearing interest of 6% per annum repayable in 2026; and \u00a35m of contingent consideration based on earnings targets within the business. The transaction is expected to complete in June 2021.\n\nAt 31 March 2021 the assets and liabilities being disposed have been classified as held for sale and impaired to their recoverable amount, which has been calculated as their fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in an exceptional impairment of \u00a351.2m (see Note 7).\n\n## (ii)  Redemption of hybrid equity bond\n\nOn 1 April 2021, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group exercised its option to redeem its \u20ac600m hybrid equity bond. The bond had no fixed redemption date, but the Group had the option to redeem all of the bond on 1 April 2021 or every 5 years thereafter. The redemption was funded through the issuance of hybrid capital bonds in July 2020.",

        "page_content": "## ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION\n\n## A1.  Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies\n\n## A1.1  Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the Group's share of the results and net assets of its interests in joint arrangements and associates. Where necessary to ensure consistency, the accounting policies of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements or associates have been adjusted to align to the accounting policies of the Group. Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from Intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to SSE plc shareholders.\n\n## Subsidiaries (Accompanying Information A3)\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group or the Company. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain variable returns from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated in the financial statements of the Group from the date that control commences until the date control ceases. Transactions with non-controlling interests that relate to their ownership interests and do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements and associates (Note 16 and Accompanying Information A3)\n\nJoint arrangements, as defined by IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements', are those arrangements that convey to two or more parties 'joint control'. Joint control exists when decisions about the 'relevant activities', being the financial, operational or strategic policies of the arrangement, are made with the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Whilst this assessment is principally focused on any 'Reserved Matters', being the material activities that typically require all significant shareholders to approve, other contractual agreements such as Power Purchase Agreements and Management Services Agreements are also considered. The Group's investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the investee's legal form and the investor's contractual rights and obligations over the assets and liabilities of the investee.\n\nAssociates are those investments over which the Group has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.\n\nThe Group's interests in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the operation. In these arrangements, the Group's share of the revenue will be eliminated as it relates to its purchased share of the output from the arrangement.\n\nThe Group's joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the joint venture and associate net investments (comprising both equity and long term loans) are carried at historical cost plus the Group's share of postacquisition results, less any impairment in value. For those investments that were formerly subsidiaries of the Group, this will also include any fair value uplift arising from loss of control. The Group recognises its share of the results of these equity-accounted operations after tax and interest in the income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured accordingly.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising on the restatement of such items is taken to the income statement as a Finance Cost, with the exception of exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity or exchange gains or losses incurred as part of a qualifying cash flow hedge. These exchange gains or losses are transferred to the translation reserve to the extent the hedge is effective. Non-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the historic rate at the date of transaction.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated into pounds sterling at the balance sheet closing rate. The results of these operations are translated at the average rate in the relevant period. Exchange differences on retranslation of the opening net assets and the results of foreign operations are transferred to the translation reserve and are reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe average and spot rates for the principal functional currencies that the Group's foreign operations are denominated in are shown in the table below\n\n|           |                    |   2021 |   2020 | Change   |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| EUR v GBP | Year end spot rate | 1.1745 | 1.1301 | 3.9%     |\n|           | Average spot rate  | 1.1249 | 1.1372 | (1.1)%   |",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies\n\n## Revenue (Notes 2 & 5)\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised to the extent that it reflects the expected consideration for goods or services provided to the customer under contract, over the performance obligations they are being provided. For each separable performance obligation identified, the Group determines whether it is satisfied at a 'point in time' or 'over time' based upon an evaluation of the receipt and consumption of benefits, control of assets and enforceable payment rights associated with that obligation. If the criteria required for 'over time' recognition are not met, the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied at a 'point in time'.\n\nRevenue principally arises as a result of the Group's activities in energy production, storage, transmission, distribution, supply and related services in the energy markets in Great Britain and Ireland. The key policies applied by each Business Area are as follows:\n\n## Transmission\n\n## Use of electricity transmission networks\n\nRevenue from use of electricity transmission networks is derived from the allowed revenue as defined by the parameters in the relevant electricity transmission licence, which informs the tariffs we set.\n\nElectricity transmission revenue is determined in accordance with the regulatory licence, based on an Ofgem approved revenue model and is recognised 'over time' as charged to National Grid. Where this revenue differs from the allowed revenue, there may be an overor under-recovery of revenue which will be reflected in future financial year's allowed revenue as set out in the regulatory licence. No accounting adjustments are therefore made for over- or under-recoveries in the year that they arise.\n\n## Transmission network contracted services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted services (transmission network connections), revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period. Any assets constructed in order to deliver the service are capitalised and depreciated over their useful life. Payments from customers are typically received from customers in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Distribution\n\n## Use of electricity distribution networks\n\nRevenue from use of electricity distribution networks is derived from the allowed revenue as defined by the parameters in the relevant electricity distribution licence, which informs the tariffs we set.\n\nElectricity distribution revenue recognised is based on the volume of electricity distributed 'over time', as use of distribution service is determined by the customer, and the set customer tariff. As with electricity transmission revenue, any over- or under-recovery of revenue is reflected in future financial year's allowed revenue as set out in the regulatory licence. No accounting adjustments are therefore made for over- or under-recoveries in the year that they arise.\n\n## Distribution network contracted services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted services (such as for distribution network connections), revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period. Any assets constructed in order to deliver the service are capitalised and depreciated over their useful life. Payments from customers are typically received from customers in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Renewables\n\n## Electricity generation\n\nRevenue from the physical generation of electricity is recognised 'point in time' as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Renewables contracted services\n\nRevenue from national support schemes, such as Renewable Obligation Certificates, is recognised at the point the performance obligation has been met. This is typically considered to be either at the point electricity has been physically generated or over the contractual period, depending on the underlying performance obligation. Revenue is measured either at the market rate at the point of generation, or at the fixed contractual consideration, depending on the individual scheme mechanic.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary generation services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.\n\n## Thermal\n\n## Electricity generation\n\nRevenue from the physical generation of electricity is recognised 'point in time' as generated and supplied to the national settlements body.

Revenue for the injection and withdrawal of gas is recognised at the point of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities at the applicable contractual rate.\n\nRevenue from gas storage secondary trading opportunities is recognised 'point in time' as injected back into the network. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Thermal Generation contracted services\n\nRevenue from national support schemes, such as the Capacity Market, is recognised at the point the performance obligation has been met. This is typically considered to be either at the point electricity has been physically generated or over the contractual period, depending on the underlying performance obligation. Revenue is measured either at the market rate at the point of generation, or at the fixed contractual consideration, depending on the individual scheme mechanic.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary generation services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.\n\n## Customers\n\n## Supply of energy\n\nRevenue on the supply of energy comprises sales to domestic and business end-user customers based on actual energy consumption including an estimate of the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. Revenue is recognised 'over time' consistent with the delivery of energy to the customer as we consider the receipt and consumption of the benefits of the energy to be simultaneous. Revenue is measured based on the applicable customer tariff rate and after deduction of any applicable contractual discounts.\n\nDetails of the estimation process for the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers is given within Note 4.1(iv).\n\nPayments from customers may be received in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. Amounts received from customers in relation to energy management services provided by Third Party Intermediaries ('TPIs') are offset against payments to those TPIs, reflecting the responsibility for providing the energy management service.\n\n## Energy related services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted energy related services, revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period at the fixed contracted rate. Where the Group has an obligation to perform a specific service, revenues are recognised 'point in time', following performance of the service at the fixed contracted consideration. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Enterprise\n\n## Construction related services\n\nFor construction related services, revenue is recognised for each identified performance obligation 'over time' by applying an input method to determine the proportion of total contract revenue (being fixed price consideration plus the latest estimate of variable consideration) that should be recognised. The input method applied is calculated by reference to the costs incurred to date on that performance obligation, relative to the total expected costs to satisfy that performance obligation, provided the contract outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Revenue from non-contracted agreements or variations to contracted work is only recognised to the extent there is additional supporting evidence to their recoverability and may be subject to constraints on recognition. Revenue on contracts in customer dispute is recognised only to the extent it is considered to be highly probable that the revenue will be recovered.\n\nCommissions in relation to acquisition of construction related contracts are expensed as incurred. No extended warranty periods are offered. Payments from customers are based on agreed billing schedules, with payment milestones typically aligned with delivery of performance obligations.\n\n## EPM & I\n\n## Commodity optimisation and other services\n\nIncome from sales commodity optimisation trading occurring in any business unit is presented net in cost of sales alongside purchase commodity optimisation trades.\n\nRevenue arising on commodities purchased in excess of the Group's requirements and recorded as inventory assets, such as Renewables Obligation Certificates, is recognised 'point in time' on disposal of these inventory assets to third parties.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.",

        "page_content": "## A1.  Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\nEPM & I continued\n\n## Physical energy production\n\nRevenue from the physical production of natural gas, crude oil and condensates arises from the Group's interest in various joint ventures and associates and is based on the entitlement method; whereby the Group's share of interest and production sharing terms are used to determine the allocation of production to each party in the arrangement. Revenue is recognised 'point in time' based on the production that has been delivered to the customer at the specified delivery point and measured based on the applicable market price as specified in the customer contracts.\n\nAside from where specifically noted above, consideration is due when the performance obligation has been satisfied. As the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and receipt of consideration from the customer is expected to be less than a year, the Group has applied the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of any financing components.\n\nRevenue from sources other than the Group's contracts with customers principally comprise meter rental income within the Enterprise business, and Contract for Difference income within certain Joint Venture arrangements.\n\nIncome on meter rental agreements, which are classified as operating leases, are presented as revenue where they relate to the core operating activities of that business. Lease payments are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nContract for Differences are agreements between a low carbon electricity generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company ('LCCC'), a UK Government owned entity responsible for delivering support mechanisms for low-carbon electricity generation. These agreements are not considered to be contracts with a customer, as the LCCC does not receive any goods or services from the generator. These arrangements are instead considered to be Government Grants, with income arising from these grants recognised in the income statement in the period in which generation takes place. This income is presented as revenue where they relate to the core operating activities of that business.\n\n## Cost of sales (Note 6)\n\nCost of sales includes fuel and energy purchases, direct employee benefits, and depreciation of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe net result from sales and purchases of commodity optimisation trades - comprising both realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from optimisation trading activities - is also presented within cost of sales, reflecting the underlying economic purpose of this trading activity.\n\n## Finance income and costs (Note 9)\n\nInterest income and costs are recognised in the income statement as they accrue, on an effective interest method. The issue costs and interest payable on bonds and all other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the income statement on the same basis.\n\nInterest on the funding attributable to major capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and depreciated as part of the total cost over the useful life of the asset.\n\nThe accounting policy for foreign exchange translation of monetary assets and liabilities is described on page 250 \uf150 and for lease liability charges on page 257 \uf150 .\n\n## Taxation (Note 10)\n\nTaxation on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities other than in business combinations that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset within the same tax authority and where the Group intends to either settle them on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n## Business Combinations (Note 12)\n\nThe acquisition of subsidiaries, and joint operations that meet the definition of a business, is accounted for under the acquisition method as defined by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\nBusiness Combinations (Note 12) continued\n\nThe cost of acquisition is measured as being the aggregate fair value of consideration to be transferred at the date control is obtained. Contingent consideration is classified as a liability and subsequently re-measured through the income statement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Held for sale assets and liabilities and discontinued operations (Note 12)\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their recoverable value is likely to be recovered via a sale or distribution as opposed to continued use by the Group. In order to be classified as assets held for sale, assets must meet all of the following conditions; the disposal is highly probable, it is available for immediate disposal, it is being actively marketed and the disposal is likely to occur within one year.\n\nAssets that qualify as held for sale and related liabilities are disclosed separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet prospectively from the date of classification. Non-current assets determined as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, no depreciation is charged in respect of these assets after classification as held for sale.\n\nAssets or groups of assets and related liabilities that qualify as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations when they represent a separate major line of business or geographical area, are part of a single plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area or are acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Income and expenses relating to these discontinued operations are disclosed in a single net amount after taxes in the income statement, with comparative amounts re-presented accordingly.\n\nIntra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from trading between continuing and discontinued operations continue to be eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Intangible assets (Note 13)\n\n## Goodwill and impairment testing\n\nGoodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to those cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. The cash-generating units used for goodwill impairment testing purposes will represent how goodwill was attributed but may not represent reportable business segments.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon investments in joint arrangements and associates. Goodwill arising on a joint operation is recorded as a separate asset and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. Goodwill arising on a joint venture or associate is recorded within the carrying amount of the Group's investment and any impairment loss is included within the share of result from joint ventures and associates. On disposal or closure of a previously acquired investment or business, any attributed goodwill will be included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased obligations certificates. These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Group's Generation and Business and Domestic Energy Supply businesses.\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has been in operation since 1 January 2005, with the Group operating under the established EU ETS carbon pricing system since that date. Since 1 January 2021, following Brexit, the UK Government has established a UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) to replace the EU ETS with the Group's UK generation assets now operating under the UK ETS carbon pricing system. Carbon allowances purchased are recorded at cost within intangible assets. Forward carbon contracts are measured at fair value with gains or losses arising on re-measurement being recognised in the income statement. A liability is recognised based on the level of emissions recorded. Up to the level of allowances held, including forward carbon contracts, the liability is measured at the cost of purchase. When the carbon emission liability exceeds the carbon allowances held, the difference is measured at market value selling price. Subsequent movements in market value are prospectively recognised in operating profit.\n\nThe carbon allowance intangible asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period to the extent requested reflecting the consumption of the economic benefit and is recorded as being utilised. As a result, no amortisation is booked but an impairment charge may be recognised should the carrying value of allowances exceed market or fair value.\n\nUnder the Renewable Obligations Certificates (ROCs) scheme, certificates obtained from own generation are awarded by a third party, Ofgem. ROCs can be traded with third parties and are ultimately used by suppliers to demonstrate to Ofgem that they have met their obligation to source a set proportion of the electricity they supply from renewable sources. The value of a ROC to a supplier comprises two elements: the 'buy-out' price which is set annually in advance of the compliance period by Ofgem; and the 'recycle' price which is determined after the compliance period by Ofgem. The recycle price element is estimated at the balance sheet date based on assumptions at that point in time around likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the remaining compliance period, and is therefore subject to possible future variation.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Intangible assets (Note 13)\n\n## continued\n\nWhere ROCs are self-generated or purchased to fulfil the Group's liability under the renewables obligation, they are recorded at market value at the point of generation or purchased within intangible assets. Following disposal of the Group's Energy Services business in January 2020 - as discussed in Note 12.2 (i) - the Group now holds ROCs in excess of the Group's renewables obligation. Due to limited evidence of liquidity or net settlement for ROC trades, we have determined that any purchased ROCs in excess of the Group's renewables obligation are recorded at the lower of cost or net realisable value within inventories. Similarly, the fair value of any forward contracts entered into at the balance sheet date for the purchase or sale of ROCs in future periods are not recognised, as there is insufficient liquidity for net settlement. The Group's liability under the renewables obligation is recognised based on electricity supplied to customers, the obligation level set by Ofgem and the prevailing market price.\n\nThe intangible assets are surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of economic benefit and release of the associated liability. As a result, no amortisation is recorded during the period.\n\n## Research and development\n\nExpenditure on research activities is charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalised as intangible assets if the project or process is considered to be technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends to complete the project or process for use or for sale. Development projects include wind farm developments, thermal generation and gas storage projects, prospective gas production assets and other developments relating to proven technologies. Costs incurred in bringing these projects to the consent stage include options over land rights, planning application costs and environmental impact studies and may be costs incurred directly or part of the fair value exercise on acquisition of an interest in a project. At the point that the project reaches the consent stage and is approved by the Board, the carrying value of the project is transferred to property, plant and equipment as assets under construction. Once in operation, depreciation will be charged over the expected useful life of the asset. The asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets that have been acquired separately by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Expenditure on internally generated brands or customer lists are expensed as incurred. Expenditure on internally developed software assets and application software licences includes contractors' fees and directly attributable labour and overheads. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of these assets. The amortisation periods utilised are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | Years         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Brands                                                      | 10            |\n| Customer lists                                              | Contract term |\n| Developed software assets and application software licences | 3-15          |\n\nThe useful lives of all the intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis. Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment (Note 14)\n\n## Owned assets\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs. Where the asset is a qualifying asset, for which a considerable period of time is required to prepare the asset for use or sale, borrowing costs will be capitalised as part of the asset's cost. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment, and depreciated accordingly. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Where a modification to a lease agreement decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right of use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications to lease agreements are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset.\n\n## Hydro civil assets\n\nThe Group is obliged under the Reservoirs Act 1975 to maintain its hydro infrastructure network, including its dams, tunnels and other hydro civil engineering structures (hydro civil assets). All items of property, plant and equipment within hydro civil assets, with the exception of land, are subject to depreciation.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Property, plant and equipment (Note 14) continued\n\nIn accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of IFRS', the Group identified the carrying value of these assets at privatisation and has treated this value as deemed cost. Following this assessment, the assets, and all subsequent enhancement and replacement expenditure, has been subject to depreciation over a useful economic life of 75 years. All subsequent maintenance expenditure is chargeable directly to the income statement.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is charged to the income statement to write off cost, less residual values, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives with the exception of Gas Production Assets which are depreciated on the Units of Production basis. Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation policy, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually, for all asset classes to ensure that the current method is the most appropriate. Depreciation commences following the asset commissioning period and when the asset is available for commercial operation. The estimated useful lives for assets depreciated on a straight line basis are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                             | Years     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Wholesale specific assets                                                                   |           |\n| Hydro civil assets                                                                          | 75 to 100 |\n| Thermal and hydro power stations including electrical and mechanical assets                 | 20 to 60  |\n| Onshore wind farms                                                                          | 20 to 25  |\n| Offshore wind farms                                                                         | 20 to 25  |\n| Gas storage facilities                                                                      | 25 to 50  |\n| E&P common infrastructure assets                                                            | 25 to 50  |\n| Networks specific assets                                                                    |           |\n| Overhead lines, underground cables and other network assets                                 | 5 to 80   |\n| Non-operational assets, fixtures, equipment, plant and machinery, vehicles and mobile plant | 5 to 10   |\n| Group wide assets                                                                           |           |\n| Office buildings                                                                            | 30 to 40  |\n| Fixtures, IT assets, vehicles and mobile plant                                              | 3 to 15   |\n\nAssets held under leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease agreement.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nIt is the Group policy to capitalise qualifying replacement expenditure and depreciate it over the expected useful life of the replaced asset. Replaced assets are derecognised at this point and the costs recorded as costs of disposal. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is replaced and it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the cost of the replacement adjusted for inflation will be used as an approximation of the cost of the replaced part at the time it was acquired or constructed.\n\nExpenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the item of property, plant and equipment to which it relates. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nAn item of property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.\n\n## Exploration, evaluation and production assets (Notes 13 and 14)\n\nThe Group uses the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with exploration wells or 'prospects'. This expenditure will be capitalised initially within intangible assets and will include licence acquisition costs associated with the prospects. Upon recognition of proved and probable reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure will be transferred to property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a unit of production basis. If the prospects are determined to be unsuccessful, and no future activity is planned, the intangible asset will be expensed in the period in which that determination is made.\n\nAll field development costs, including rights and concessions related to production activities, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment. Capitalised costs relate to the acquisition and installation of production assets and facilities and include specialist engineering, drilling and technical services costs. These property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated from the commencement of production in the fields concerned, using the unit of production method, based on the estimated proven and probable reserves of those fields. Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.\n\nAll common infrastructure costs, such as production facilities or pipelines that are common to more than one field, are depreciated on a straight line basis, reflecting their shared usage unrelated to the production of any one field.",

        "page_content": "## A1.  Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\nA1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\nExploration, evaluation and production assets (Notes 13 and 14) continued\n\nAll exploration and production assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where indicators of impairment are identified, the carrying value of the field assets are compared with the expected discounted future net cashflows associated with the remaining estimated commercial reserves. An impairment loss will be recognised where it is considered that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the net present value of future net cashflows. Note that the Gas Production business, in which all exploration, evaluation and production assets are recorded, is classified as 'held for sale' in the financial statements to 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021.\n\n## Lease arrangements (Note 21)\n\nLease arrangements are separately distinguished from service contracts on the basis of whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Group is deemed to control the use of an identified asset, a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised on the balance sheet.\n\nRight of use assets are capitalised and held as part of property, plant and equipment. The accounting policy for such arrangements is described on page 255 \uf150 .\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined the incremental borrowing rate is used. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Group has applied the intercompany borrowing rate which is based on the Group's external medium-term borrowing rates with premia adjustments for any subsidiary specific risk factors.\n\nIn determining whether any break and/or extension clauses should be included within the lease term, the Group has considered that where an internal decision has been made to break or extend the lease agreement, that decision shall be applied in determining the appropriate lease term. Where an internal decision has not been made, and where the non-cancellable element of the lease term has longer than five years remaining, it is considered that any clauses will not be triggered as any decision beyond that date is not reasonably certain. For all leases with less than five years remaining, an assessment is made at each reporting period on a lease-by-lease basis on whether the clause is reasonably certain to be triggered. Reassessment of break and/or extension judgements made in prior periods could result in recalculation of the lease liability and adjustments to associated balances.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently adjusted for unwind of discounting, repayments and other modifications to the underlying agreement. Lease modifications are accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or more underlying assets and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price of the increase in scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right of use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset.\n\nLeases with a duration of 12 months or less and leases for assets which are deemed 'low value' are expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Impairment review (Note 15)\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's PP&E and other intangible assets and the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or where there are indications that a previously recognised impairment loss has reduced. For PP&E assets that have previously been identified as exhibiting indications of impairment, the review of impairment will be performed annually until there is sufficient evidence to confirm that any potential impairment loss has been appropriately recognised, or until previously recognised impairment losses have been fully written back. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life or which are not yet ready for use, the test for impairment is carried out annually. In addition, financial assets measured at amortised cost are also reviewed for impairment annually.\n\nFor assets subject to impairment testing, the asset's carrying value is compared to the asset's (or cash-generating unit (CGU)'s, in the case of goodwill), recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS) and the value-in-use (VIU) of the asset or CGU. For financial assets measured at amortised cost the impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nIf the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge will be recognised immediately in the income statement. Reversals of previous impairment charges are recognised if the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU significantly exceeds the carrying amount. Previous impairments of goodwill are not reversed.\n\nValue in use (VIU) calculations require the estimation of future cash flows to be derived from the respective assets (or CGUs) and the selection of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate their present value. The VIU methodology is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate economic value and is deemed to be the most appropriate for reviews of PP&E asset and the Group's identified goodwill-related CGUs. The methodology is based on the pre-tax cash flows arising from the specific assets, underlying assets or CGUs, and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the Group's cost of funding and adjusted for any specific risks. The estimation of the timing and value of underlying projected cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates involves management judgement. Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Impairment review (Note 15) continued\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell methodology also uses a present value technique, unless there is a quoted price in an active market for that asset. The methodology is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the specific assets, underlying assets or CGUs, and discounted using a post-tax discount rate determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations, adjusted for the relevant taxation rate.\n\nAny impairment charge identified will initially be adjusted against the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit. Any excess charge will be allocated against the remaining assets of the cash-generating unit. Reversals of previous impairment charges are allocated against the carrying value of assets previously subject to an impairment charge.\n\n## Inventories (Note 17)\n\nInventories - aside from inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities - are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\nGas inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is held at fair value with reference to the forward month market price. Gains and losses on remeasurement at fair value are recognised within the Income Statement, as a 'certain remeasurement' item.\n\n## Provisions (Note 20)\n\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nThe estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of certain assets is reviewed periodically. Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, and gas storage facilities, offshore wind farms and power stations at the end of the useful life of the facilities. The estimates are based on technology and prices at the balance sheet date and excludes any salvage value related to those assets. A corresponding decommissioning asset is recognised and is included within property, plant and equipment when the provision gives access to future economic benefits. Changes in these provisions are recognised prospectively. The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in finance costs and the depreciation for the asset is straight-line over the expected useful life of the asset or, for gas production facilities, is amortised on the unit of production method.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations (Note 23)\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, one of which is operated by the Company. Pension scheme assets are measured using bid market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.\n\nAny increase in the present value of liabilities within the Group's defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the year is charged as service costs to operating profit.\n\nNet interest costs are based on net schemes' liabilities adjusted for minimum funding requirement and pension surplus restrictions under IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction'. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.\n\n## Defined contribution pension schemes\n\nThe Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amounts charged represent the contributions payable to the schemes in the year and are charged directly to the income statement.\n\n## Equity and equity-related compensation benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of employee share schemes as described in the Remuneration Report. These schemes enable Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.\n\nThe exercise prices of the sharesave scheme are set at a discount to market price at the date of the grant. The fair value of the sharesave scheme option granted is measured at the grant date by use of a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the options granted is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the scheme vests. Estimates are updated for non-market conditions at each balance sheet date with any adjustment in respect of the current and prior years being recognised in the income statement. The costs associated with the other main employee schemes are recognised over the period to which they relate. The charge related to the equity shares in the Company awarded under the share schemes is treated as an increase in the cost of investment held by the Company in the subsidiary companies of the Group. The disclosures on equity and equity-related compensation benefits have been removed on the grounds of materiality in relation to the Group.",

        "page_content": "## A1.  Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Financial instruments (Note 24)\n\nThe Group uses a range of financial instruments to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and energy price fluctuations in its normal course of business and in accordance with the Group's risk management policies. The Group's risk management policies are further explained in A6.\n\nAs previously noted in the 31 March 2018 Annual Report, the Group's review of the IFRS 9 hedge accounting model concluded that whilst adoption would not change the treatment of existing hedging arrangements, the changes made would not result in any additional hedge designations either. As such, the existing hedge accounting model under IAS 39 appropriately reflects our risk management activities in the financial statements. Therefore, as permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. This policy choice will be periodically reviewed to consider any changes in our risk management activities.\n\n## Interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives\n\nFinancial derivative instruments are used by the Group to hedge interest rate and currency exposures. All such derivatives are recognised at fair value and are re-measured to fair value each reporting period. Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as being held for hedging purposes. The designation of the hedge relationship is established at the inception of the hedge and procedures are applied to ensure the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective and that the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured. The treatment of gains and losses on re-measurement is dependent on the classification of the hedge and whether the hedge relationship is designated as either a 'fair value' or 'cash flow' hedge. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are treated as if held for trading, with all fair value movements being recorded through the income statement.\n\nA derivative classified as a 'fair value' hedge recognises gains and losses from re-measurement immediately in the income statement. Loans and borrowings are measured at cost except where they form the underlying transaction in an effective fair value hedge relationship. In such cases, the carrying value of the loan or borrowing is adjusted to reflect fair value movements with the gain or loss being reported in the income statement.\n\nA derivative classified as a 'cash flow' hedge recognises the portion of gains or losses on the derivative which are deemed to be effective directly in equity in the hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of the gains or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At the point of discontinuation, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss. On settlement, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nWithin its regular course of business, the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase derivative contracts for commodities such as electricity, gas, coal, carbon allowances and oil. Where the contract was entered into and continues to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected sale, purchase or usage requirements, the contracts are designated as 'own use' contracts and are measured at cost. These contracts are not within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nDerivative commodity contracts which are not designated as own use contracts are accounted for as trading derivatives and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. Where a hedge accounting relationship is designated and is proven to be effective, the changes in fair value will be recognised in accordance with the rules noted above. There are currently no designated hedge relationships in relation to commodity contracts.\n\nOther commodity contracts, where own use is not established and a hedge accounting relationship is not designated, are measured at fair value with gains and losses on re-measurement being recognised in the income statement in cost of sales.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives where the characteristics of the derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contracts.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted in a manner similar to effective cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, in the translation reserve, and any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any gains or losses recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.",

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments that are reacquired are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## Hybrid equity\n\nHybrid equity comprises issued bonds that qualify for recognition as equity. Accordingly, any coupon payments are accounted for as dividends and are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon payments are discretionary and relate to equity. Coupon payments consequently do not have any impact on the income statement. Coupon payments are recognised in the cash flow statement in the same way as dividends to ordinary shareholders. Tax credits in relation to the coupon payments are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.\n\n## Hybrid Debt\n\nHybrid debt comprises issued bonds that have a fixed redemption date and are accounted within Loans and Borrowings. Coupon payments are recognised within the income statement as a finance cost.\n\n## A2.  Taxation\n\nThe Group's primary tax disclosures are included at Note 10.

The Group's Gas Production business, which is presented as a discontinued operation in the current and prior year, is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% (combined 40%). Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.\n\nCapital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on property, plant and equipment. The rates are determined by Parliament annually and spread the tax relief due over a number of years. This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the expenditure on property, plant and equipment is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.\n\nThe different accounting treatment of property, plant and equipment for tax and accounting purposes means that the taxable income of the Group is not the same as the profit reported in the financial statements. The substantial impairments undertaken in previous years in relation to certain property, plant and equipment assets, result in the depreciation or impairment charge to profit for the year differing to the amount of capital allowances due to the Group.\n\nShort term temporary differences arise on items such as provisions for restructuring costs and onerous contracts, and retirement benefit obligations, because the treatment of such items is different for tax and accounting purposes. These differences usually reverse in the year following that in which they arise, as is reflected in the deferred tax charge in these financial statements. Where interest charges or other costs are capitalised in the accounts, tax relief is either given as the charges are incurred or when the costs are taken to the income statement.",

Taxation continued\n\n## Reconciliation of tax charge to adjusted underlying current tax continued\n\nAs explained at Accompanying Information A1 and A6, the Group measures its operating and financing derivatives at fair value under IFRS 9. As a result of the Group's subsidiaries applying the HMRC's 'disregard regulations', the re-measurement movements have no current tax effect impacting only the deferred tax position.\n\nAs detailed at Note 22 and explained in the Accompanying Information A1, the Group has issued Hybrid equity securities which are treated as a component of equity. While the coupon payments relating to these securities are treated as distributions to the holders of the equity instruments, tax relief is allowed on the amount paid in the year. These tax credits are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.\n\n## A3.

Scotia Gas Networks Limited has operated the gas distribution networks in Scotland and the South of England from 1 June 2005. The Group's gas supply activity incurs gas distribution charges while the Group also provides services to Scotia Gas Networks in the form of a management service agreement for corporate services, stock procurement services and the provision of the capital expenditure on the development of front office management information systems.\n\nThe amounts outstanding are trading balances, are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. Aggregate capital loans to joint ventures and associates are shown in Note 16.\n\n## A6.  Financial risk management\n\nThis note presents information about the fair value of the Group's financial instruments, the Group's exposure to the risks associated with those instruments, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk\n- \u00b7 Commodity risk\n- \u00b7 Currency risk\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's policies for risk management are established to identify the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.\n\nSSE has a Group-wide risk committee reporting to the Group Executive Committee, responsible for reviewing the strategic, market, credit, operational and liquidity risks and exposures that arise from the Group's operating activities. In addition, the Group has a Board level sub-committee, the Energy Markets Risk Committee, chaired by Non-Executive Director Tony Cocker, which was established to oversee the Group's approach to hedging.",

        "page_content": "## ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION CONTINUED\n\n## A6.  Financial risk management continued\n\nExposure to the commodity, currency and interest rate risks noted arise in the normal course of the Group's business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks. The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.\n\n## A6.1  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.\n\nCredit risk arising from the Group's normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures. Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided. Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.\n\nCredit risk management for the Group's SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is financially controlled by the individual business units. The Group's greatest credit risks lie with the operations of the Customers business, the wholesale procurement activities conducted by Energy Portfolio Management ('EPM') under a trust arrangement and the activities carried out by the Group's Treasury function. In all cases, specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied. Exposure to credit risk in the retail supply of electricity and gas to end user customers arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables. Following the disposal of SSE Energy Services, the Group exposure to retail supply customers is limited to customers of the Group's Airtricity business. The creditworthiness of these customers is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information. The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.\n\nExposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty:\n\n- \u00b7 holds an investment grade credit rating; or\n- \u00b7 can be assessed as adequately creditworthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies; or\n- \u00b7 can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions; or\n- \u00b7 can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the relevant Risk or Treasury Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the Group Board.\n\nCredit support clauses or side agreements are typically included or entered into to protect the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery. As part of its normal activities, EPM transacts significant volumes of commodity derivative products through cleared exchanges to mitigate credit risk. Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.\n\nIndividual counterparty credit exposures are monitored by category of credit risk and are subject to approved limits. At 31 March 2021, EPM had pledged \u00a3201.8m (2020: \u00a3183.1m) of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received \u00a380.1m (2020: \u00a3182.8m) of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on credit risk.\n\nBank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default. Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Tax and Treasury Committee.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash. These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Group's market risks - commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.\n\nTrade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated after an allowance for impairment.",

Trade receivables associated with the Group's 1.2 million electricity and gas customers (from continuing operations) are recorded in this segment. The Group also has significant receivables associated with its EPM activities which are generally settled within two to four weeks from invoicing. The Group's exposure to credit risk is therefore subject to diversification with no exposure to individual retail customers totalling >10% of trade receivables. The biggest customer balance, due from an EPM customer (also an EPM supplier), is 4% (2020: 13%) of the total trade receivables.\n\nThe ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was:\n\n|                                         | 2021  \u00a3m  Continuing  operations   | 2021  \u00a3m  HFS Assets and  Discontinued  Operations   | 2021  \u00a3m  Total SSE Group   | 2020  \u00a3m  Total SSE Group   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Not past due                            | 743.4                              | 68.6                                                 | 812.0                       | 838.5                       |\n| Past due but not individually impaired: |                                    |                                                      |                             |                             |\n| 0 - 30 days                             | 55.2                               | 3.0                                                  | 58.2                        | 56.9                        |\n| 31 - 90 days                            | 26.0                               | 1.9                                                  | 27.9                        | 36.7                        |\n| Over 90 days                            | 84.7                               | 5.1                                                  | 89.8                        | 59.7                        |\n|                                         | 909.3                              | 78.6                                                 | 987.9                       | 991.8                       |\n| Less: allowance for impairment          | ( 7 7. 1 )                         | (0.7)                                                | ( 7 7. 8)                   | ( 7 7. 7 )                  |\n| Net Trade receivables                   | 832.2                              | 77.9                                                 | 910.1                       | 914.1                       |\n\nThe Group has past due debt which has not had an impairment allowance set aside to cover potential credit losses.

Financial risk management continued\n\n## A6.2  Concentrations of risk continued\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment of trade receivables on continuing operations was:\n\n|                                      | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Balance at 1 April                   | 77.7       | 41.9       |\n| Increase in allowance for impairment | 17.6       | 39.2       |\n| Impairment losses recognised         | (17.5)     | (3.4)      |\n| Transfer to held for sale            | (0.7)      | -          |\n| Balance at 31 March                  | 77.1       | 77.7       |\n\nAt the end of each reporting period a review of the allowance for impairment of trade receivables is performed. Trade receivables do not contain a significant financing element, and therefore expected credit losses are measured using the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires lifetime expected credit losses to be recognised on initial recognition. A provision matrix is utilised to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses, based on the age, status and risk of each class of receivable, which is updated periodically to include changes to both forward-looking and historical inputs such as the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n## A6.3  Liquidity risk and going concern\n\nLiquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Group's Treasury function. The Group can be exposed to significant movements in its liquidity position due to changes in commodity prices, working capital requirements, the impact of the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital investment and recycling programmes.\n\nTreasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts. Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board. The department's operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Tax and Treasury Committee and Audit Committee.\n\nIn relation to the Group's liquidity risk, the Group's policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nDuring the year, the Group's approach to managing liquidity was to seek to ensure that the Group had available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 6 month period.\n\nThe Group uses cash flow forecasts to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements. Typically, the Group will fund any short term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from committed and uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus. Details of the Group's borrowings are disclosed at Note 21. In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at Note 21.3, the Group has \u00a3100m of uncommitted bank lines and a \u00a315m overdraft facility.\n\nThe refinancing requirement in the period to 31 December 2022 is \u00a32.5bn, including \u00a31.0bn of voluntary calls on hybrid instruments. The view of the Directors is that the Group's 105% funding policy is currently met out to 31 December 2022, after the voluntary redemption of hybrid instruments, through \u00a31.6bn of surplus cash at 31 March 2021 and \u00a31.5bn of undrawn committed facilities.\n\nGiven the cash surplus of \u00a31.6bn at 31 March 2021; the undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a31.5bn maintained by the Group; the current commercial paper market conditions; and the assumption the Group will be able to refinance maturing debt, the Directors have concluded that both the Group and SSE plc as Parent Company have sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have considered sensitivities on future cashflow projections resulting from the coronavirus pandemic; the Group's credit rating; the success of the Group's disposal programme through 2020/21; and the successful issuance of \u00a32.5bn of medium to long term debt and Hybrid equity during the year. In the very unlikely event of not being able to access the revolving credit facility or otherwise refinance as may be required, the Group's options include not calling the \u00a31.0bn Hybrid debt instruments due in September 2022, deferring uncommitted capex and implementing further cost reductions. The statement of going concern is included in the Audit Committee Report on page 128 \uf150 .\n\nTreasury also manage the Group's interaction with its relationship banks (defined as those banks that support the Group's financing activities through their ongoing participation in the committed lending facilities that are maintained by the Group). These are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of investment grade or better allocated by a recognised major ratings group. In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, due to the favourable mark-to-market position of the Group's derivative financial instruments, the Group currently holds \u00a337.1m of third party cash deposits in respect of margin calls on exchange traded positions (2020: \u00a3256.4m deposited).",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## A6.4  Commodity risk\n\nThe Group's Energy Portfolio Management ('EPM') business implements the hedging policy through trading in the commodity markets and manages the requirement for the delivery of the Group's physical commodity needs as part of its normal course of business. The risk management activity carried out by EPM arises from the Group's requirement to source gas, electricity or other commodities such as renewable obligation certificates for Business Energy and Airtricity, and to procure fuel and other commodities and provide a route-tomarket for SSE Renewables, Thermal Generation, Gas Storage and the discontinued Gas Production business.\n\n## Current hedging approach\n\nThe Group has traded in four principal commodities during the year, as well as the spreads between two or more commodity prices: power (baseload and other products); gas; carbon (emissions allowances); and oil. Trading in oil ceased during the year, as a result of the agreement to dispose of the Group's Gas Production business on an unhedged basis. Each commodity has different liquidity characteristics, which impacts on the degree of hedging possible. Similarly, each of the Group's assets carries different exposures to the commodity market and thus requires a different approach to hedging. As such, the Group's current hedging approach varies by each class of asset as follows:\n\n| Asset class                               | Minimum Hedge Target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Principal Commodity Exposures   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| GB Wind                                   | Target to hedge of less than 100% of anticipated wind energy output for the   coming 12 months.

EPM is only able to accept internal trades when there is sufficient liquidity to offset them in the external market or they can be offset with internal trades from other asset classes. In this way, the commodity risks to which EPM is individually exposed are minimised.\n\nThe volumetric extent to which assets are hedged are reported monthly, and to the EMRC on at least a quarterly basis. Variations to the hedging approach above will be required as markets and other factors (such as asset disposals, Brexit or coronavirus) change. The EMRC also receives reporting on credit risk, other risk measures, and market liquidity in assessing whether any variations to the hedging approach are required.\n\nIn November 2020, SSE Thermal temporarily adjusted its approach to forward hedging of its thermal generation output for periods beyond March 2021 in response to the uncertainty of long-term carbon pricing due to the UK's exit from the European Union.\n\nThe Group measures and manages the Commodity Risk associated with the financial and non-financial commodity contracts it is exposed to. However, only certain commodity contracts within the Group constitute financial instruments under IFRS 9. As a result, it is only the fair value of IFRS 9 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Group's commodity price risk under IFRS 7.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## A6.4  Commodity risk continued\n\nThis is a consequence of the Group's accounting policy which stipulates that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 should be accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in profit or equity. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 will be accounted for as 'own use' contracts. As fair value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk. Furthermore, other physical contracts can be treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand. The accounting policies associated with financial instruments are explained in the Accompanying Information section A1.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Group's IFRS 9 commodity contracts. IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group's financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair value or cash flows associated with the Group's financial instruments.\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date. The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been calculated on the basis that the proportion of commodity contracts that are IFRS 9 financial instruments remains consistent with those at that point. Excluded from this analysis are all commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9.\n\n|                        | 2021           | 2021                                                  | 2020           | 2020                                                  |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | Base Price (i) | Reasonably  possible  increase/ decrease in  variable | Base Price (i) | Reasonably  possible  increase/ decrease in  variable |\n| Commodity prices       |                |                                                       |                |                                                       |\n| UK gas (p/therm)       | 44             | +/-20                                                 | 35             | +/-8                                                  |\n| UK power (\u00a3/MWh)       | 53             | +/-24                                                 | 39             | +/-9                                                  |\n| UK coal (US$/tonne)    | 72             | +/-11                                                 | 61             | +/-7                                                  |\n| UK emissions (\u20ac/tonne) | 43             | +/-11                                                 | 18             | +/-6                                                  |\n| UK oil (US$/bbl)       | 59             | +/-11                                                 | 42             | +/-8                                                  |\n\nThe impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation based on the rationale described are as follows:\n\n| Incremental profit/(loss)            | 2021 Impact on profit  and equity  \u00a3m   | 2020 Impact on profit  and equity  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Commodity prices combined - increase | 428.5                                   | 104.7                                   |\n| Commodity prices combined - decrease | (428.5)                                 | (104.7)                                 |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical and is based on the exposure to energy-related commodities, and their corresponding valuation under IFRS 9, that the Group has at each period end.

As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Group's transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.\n\nThe Group's policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk. All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates. The policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable. The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Group's requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## A6.6  Interest rate risk continued\n\nThe Group's policy is to manage this risk by stipulating that a minimum of 50% of Group borrowings be subject to fixed rates of interest, either directly through the debt instruments themselves or through the use of derivative financial instruments. The floating rate borrowings are provided by banks including the European Investment Bank (EIB). Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than Sterling, cross currency swaps. These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Group's financial performance.\n\nAlthough interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings. Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades. The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise cash advances from the European Investment Bank (EIB), however the Group is currently carrying a surplus cash position of \u00a31.6bn.\n\nThe impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question. Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair value through the income statement. In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement. Changes in variable rate instruments and hedging instruments and hedged items recorded under fair value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement. The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.\n\nThe net exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date can be summarised thus:\n\n|                                                  | 2021  Carrying  Amount  \u00a3m   | 2020  Carrying  Amount  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Interest bearing/earning assets and liabilities: |                              |                              |\n| - fixed                                          | (9,804.2)                    | (8,900.3)                    |\n| - floating                                       | 1,721.7                      | (1,209.4)                    |\n|                                                  | (8,082.5)                    | (10,109.7)                   |\n| Represented by:                                  |                              |                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | 1,600.2                      | 164.6                        |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                 | (272.1)                      | (102.7)                      |\n| Loans and borrowings                             | (8,989.6)                    | ( 9,717. 2)                  |\n| Lease liabilities                                | (421.0)                      | (454.4)                      |\n|                                                  | (8,082.5)                    | (10,109.7)                   |\n\nFollowing from this, the table below represents the expected impact of a change of 100 basis points in short term interest rates at the reporting date in relation to equity and income statement. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. An increase in exchange rates would be a change to either the income statement or equity. The assessment is based on a revision of the fair value assumptions included in the calculated exposures in the previous table.\n\nAll sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the proportion of fixed to floating instruments being consistent as at the balance sheet date and is stated after the effect of taxation.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Group's exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing. The calculations are based on linear extrapolations of rate changes which may not reflect the actual result which would impact upon the Group.\n\n|                  | 2021  \u00a3m   |   2020  \u00a3m |\n|------------------|------------|------------|\n| Income statement | (0.9)      |         11 |\n\nThe impact of a decrease in rates would be an equal reduction in the annual charge. There is no impact on equity as the analysis relates to the Group's net exposure at the balance sheet date. Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the Group's covered position.",

The carrying value of these assets are approximately equivalent to fair value due to short term maturity aside from loans and borrowings which are subject to longer maturity dates.\n\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are measured at either Fair Value through Profit and Loss ('FVTPL') or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVTOCI'). Fair values for energy derivatives are based on unadjusted quoted market prices, where actively traded. For energy derivatives that are not actively traded, interest rate instruments, foreign currency hedge contracts and cross currency swap contracts associated with foreign currency denominated long-term fixed rate debt, the fair values are determined by reference to closing rate market prices for similar instruments. Fair values for unquoted equity instruments are derived from venture capital or growth equity firm valuation statements.",

Hedge accounting\n\n## A8.1  Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group designates contracts which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes either as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IFRS 9. The Group's accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in the Accompanying Information section A1.\n\nThe following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated. Non-Sterling denominated contractual cash flows have been converted at the forward foreign exchange rate.\n\n| Cash flow hedges             | 2021  Carrying  amount   | 2021  Expected  cash  flows   | 2021  0-12  months   | 2021  1-2 years   | 2021  2-5 years   | 2021  > 5 years   | 2020  Carrying  amount   | 2020  Expected  cash  flows   | 2020  0-12  months   | 2020  1-2 years   | 2020  2-5 years   | 2020  > 5 years   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps:         |                          |                               |                      |                   |                   |                   |                          |                               |                      |                   |                   |                   |\n| Assets                       | 0.1                      | 0.2                           | -                    | (0.1)             | -                 | 0.3               | 334.0                    | 334.0                         | 101.1                | 99.0              | 116.8             | 17.1              |\n| Liabilities                  | (8.4)                    | (8.5)                         | -                    | (1.9)             | (5.5)             | (1.1)             | (113.7)                  | (113.7)                       | (30.1)               | (14.7)            | (32.8)            | (36.1)            |\n|                              | (8.3)                    | (8.3)                         | -                    | (2.0)             | (5.5)             | (0.8)             | 220.3                    | 220.3                         | 71.0                 | 84.3              | 84.0              | (19.0)            |\n| Cross currency swaps:        |                          |                               |                      |                   |                   |                   |                          |                               |                      |                   |                   |                   |\n| Assets                       | 137.1                    | 142.3                         | 4.5                  | 17.0              | 123.0             | (2.2)             | -                        | -                             | -                    | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| Liabilities                  | (157.0)                  | (151.1)                       | ( 7.6)               | (98.6)            | (49.1)            | 4.2               | -                        | -                             | -                    | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n|                              | (19.9)                   | (8.8)                         | (3.1)                | (81.6)            | 73.9              | 2.0               | -                        | -                             | -                    | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| Forward exchange  contracts: |                          |                               |                      |                   |                   |                   |                          |                               |                      |                   |                   |                   |\n| Assets                       | 11.7                     | 169.6                         | 169.6                | -                 | -                 | -                 | 28.3                     |                               | (1,558.7) (1,556.4)  | (2.3)             | -                 | -                 |\n| Liabilities                  | (52.6)                   | (890.1)                       | (292.7)              | (430.7)           | (166.7)           | -                 | (8.2)                    | (288.5)                       | (121.2)              | (167.3)           | -                 | -                 |\n|                              | (40.9)                   | (720.5)                       | (123.1)              | (430.7)           | (166.7)           | -                 | 20.1                     | ( 1 , 8 47. 2)                | (1,677.6)            | (169.6)           | -                 | -                 |\n\n## A8.2  Net investment hedge\n\nThe Group's net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency (\u20ac) as the net investment in foreign subsidiaries with \u20ac denominated functional currencies being the Airtricity Supply business and the thermal plants and wind farms in Ireland. The hedge compares the element of the net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in \u20ac to the matching portion of the \u20ac borrowings held by the Group. This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nGains and losses in the hedge are recognised in equity and will be transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation (2021: \u00a337.3m gain, 2020: \u00a328.7m loss). Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement (2021: \u00a3nil, 2020: \u00a30.7m).",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\n## 1.  Principal accounting policies\n\n## 1.1  General information\n\nSSE plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Scotland. The address of the registered office is given on the back cover. The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.\n\n## 1.2  Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Reduced Disclosures) ('FRS 101') and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and adopted by the European Union ('adopted IFRS').\n\nUnder section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.\n\nIt has also taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101.\n\n- \u00b7 A Cash flow statement and related notes;\n- \u00b7 Related party disclosures;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures in respect of capital management; and\n- \u00b7 The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of SSE plc include the equivalent disclosure, the Company has also taken advantage of the exemptions, under FRS 101, available in respect of the following disclosure:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instrument disclosures\n\nThe Company previously assessed that, on the basis of materiality, the disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment should be removed. The Company has assessed that at 31 March 2021 these disclosures continue to be immaterial to the Company's financial statements.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (further details are contained in A6 Accompanying Information of the consolidated financial statements). The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements of the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, availablefor-sale financial assets and assets of the Company pension scheme which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Company pension scheme which are measured using the projected unit credit method. The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view. The financial statements of the Company are presented in pounds sterling.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements. The Group's key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted in Note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately. In particular, Note 4.1(ii), Retirement Benefit Obligations, and the related disclosures in Note 23 of the consolidated financial statements are relevant to the Company.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these individual financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment charges.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements and associates\n\nAssociates are those investments over which the Company has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.\n\nThe Company's joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the joint venture and associate investments are carried at historical cost plus the Company's share of post-acquisition results, less any impairment in value. The Company recognises its share of the results of these equity-accounted operations after tax and interest in the income statement.",

The \u20ac500m tranche has been partly swapped back to Sterling, resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of just under 3.8% per annum.",

This resulted in the issue of 1,918,977 and 883,408 new fully paid ordinary shares respectively (2020: 19,086,291 and 9,136,089). In addition, the Company issued 0.9m (2020: 0.8m) shares during the year under the savings-related share option schemes (all of which were settled by shares held in Treasury) for a consideration of \u00a310.4m (2020: \u00a310.1m).\n\nOf the 1,049.1m shares in issue, 6.1m are held as treasury shares. These shares will be held by the Group and used to award shares to employees under the Sharesave scheme in the UK.\n\nDuring the year, on behalf of the Company, the employee share trust purchased 0.9m shares for a total consideration of \u00a312.9m (2020: 1.1m shares, consideration of \u00a314.6m) to be held in trust for the benefit of employee share schemes. At 31 March 2021, the trust held 7.7m shares (2020: 7.6m) which had a market value of \u00a3112.5m (2020: \u00a399.3m).\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe capital redemption reserve comprises the value of shares redeemed or purchased by the Company from distributable profits.\n\n## Hedge reserve\n\nThe hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedge derivative instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.\n\n## Hybrid equity\n\n|                                                           | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| GBP 750m 3.875% perpetual subordinated capital securities | -         | 748.3     |\n| EUR 600m 2.375% perpetual subordinated capital securities | 421.4     | 421.4     |\n| GBP 600m 3.74% perpetual subordinated capital securities  | 598.0     | -         |\n| EUR 500m 3.125% perpetual subordinated capital securities | 453.0     | -         |\n|                                                           | 1,472.4   | 1,169.7   |",

This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus. The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2021 was equal to \u00a3543.1m (2020: \u00a3534.2m).\n\nThe individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows:\n\nScottish Hydro Electric\n\n| Latest formal actuarial valuation       | 31 March 2018    |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Valuation carried out by                | Hymans Robertson |\n| Value of assets based on valuation      | \u00a32,059.0m        |\n| Value of liabilities based on valuation | \u00a31,902.3m        |\n| Valuation method adopted                | Projected Unit   |\n| Average salary increase                 | RPI +1.%         |\n| Average pension increase                | RPI              |\n| Value of fund assets/accrued benefits   | 108.2%           |\n\n## 10.1  Pension scheme assumptions\n\nThe scheme has been updated to 31 March 2021 by qualified independent actuaries.

The assumptions, equivalent to future longevity for members in normal health at age 65, are as follows:\n\n|                   |   At  31 March  2021 Male |   At  31 March  2021 Female |   At  31 March  2020 Male |   At  31 March  2020 Female |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Currently aged 65 |                        23 |                          24 |                        23 |                          24 |\n| Currently aged 45 |                        25 |                          27 |                        24 |                          26 |\n\nThe impact on the scheme's liabilities of changing certain of the major assumptions is as follows:\n\n|                                          | At 31 March 2021                  | At 31 March 2021               | At 31 March 2020                  | At 31 March 2020              |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme  liabilities | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme liabilities |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                        | 0.1%                              | +/-0.2%                       |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 0.1%                              | +/-1.0%                        | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                       |\n| Discount rate                            | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                        | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                       |\n| Longevity                                | 1 year                            | +/-1.8%                        | 1 year                            | +/-1.8%                       |\n\nThese assumptions are considered to have the most significant impact on the scheme valuations. The reduction in sensitivity is due to the conversion of the longevity swap to buy-in during the year.\n\n## Asset buy-in\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme entered into an asset buy-in, transferring the risk of volatility in the assumptions used to calculate the obligation for 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependents (covering c\u00a3800m of the scheme's liabilities) to a third party. The asset buy-in is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy. This is in addition to a previous buy-in completed during the year ended 31 March 2018 when c\u00a3250m of the scheme's assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependents were transferred to a third party. The Company has now insured against volatility in obligations related to all pensioners to third parties (insurer PIC) and is now only exposed to valuation fluctuations related to active and deferred members.\n\n## 10.2  Valuation of Pension Scheme\n\n|                                             | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March  2021 \u00a3m   | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March  2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| Equities                                    | 50.3        | -             | 50.3                          | 107.1       | -             | 107.1                         |\n| Government bonds                            | 660.9       | -             | 660.9                         | 482.9       | -             | 482.9                         |\n| Corporate bonds                             | -           | -             | -                             | -           | -             | -                             |\n| Insurance contracts                         | -           | 780.3         | 780.3                         | -           | 725.4         | 725.4                         |\n| Other investments                           | 482.6       | -             | 482.6                         | 530.2       | -             | 530.2                         |\n| Total fair value of plan assets             |             |               | 1,974.1                       |             |               | 1,845.6                       |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation |             |               | (1,431.0)                     |             |               | (1,311.4)                     |\n| Surplus in the scheme                       |             |               | 543.1                         |             |               | 534.2                         |\n| Deferred tax thereon (i)                    |             |               | (103.2)                       |             |               | (101.5)                       |\n| Net pension asset                           |             |               | 439.9                         |             |               | 432.7                         |",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Confirming our understanding of management's Going Concern process as well as the review controls in place over the preparation of the group's Going Concern model and the memoranda on going concern;\n- \u00b7 Engaging early with management to ensure all key matters were considered in their assessment;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining management's board approved forecast cash flows, covenant forecasts and sensitivities prepared by management to 31 December 2022, ensuring the same forecasts are used elsewhere within the group for accounting estimates. We tested for arithmetical accuracy of the models as well as checking the net debt position at the year-end date which is the starting point for the model. We assessed the reasonableness of the cashflow forecast by analysing management's historical forecasting accuracy and understanding how any anticipated continued impact of coronavirus has been modelled. We performed reverse stress testing to understand how plausible the severe downside scenarios would need be to result in negative liquidity or a covenant breach. The EY assessment reflects all maturing debt through to 31 March 2023;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing management's assessment of mitigating options potentially available to the group to reduce cash flow spend in the Going Concern period, to determine their plausibility and whether such actions could be effected by management. We have obtained analysis to determine whether these were within the control of management and evaluated the impact of these mitigations in light of our understanding of the business and its cost structures;\n- \u00b7 Performing a detailed review of borrowing facilities to assess their continued availability to the group and to ensure completeness of covenants identified by management;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing market data for indicators of potential contradictory evidence to challenge the Going Concern assessment including review of profit warnings within the sector and review of industry analyst reports. We held discussions with the Audit Committee to confirm the Going Concern position prepared by management.\n- \u00b7 We considered whether management's disclosures in the financial statements sufficiently and appropriately reflect the going concern assessment and outcomes.",

        "page_content": "## Conclusions relating to going concern continued\n\nThe audit procedures performed in evaluating the director's assessment were performed by the Group audit team, however we also considered the financial and non-financial information communicated to us from our components teams as sources of potential contrary indicators which may cast doubt over the Going Concern assessment.\n\n## Our key observations\n\nThe group is forecast to continue to be profitable and generate positive cashflows during the going concern period. The group is forecast to maintain adequate liquidity and headroom within its covenants and the reverse stress test scenario suggests that the group would need to be exposed to severe downside events impacting profitability and cash flows in order to breach liquidity or covenants. In this remote scenario, management still consider that the impact can be mitigated by further cash and cost saving measures which are within their control during the going concern period.\n\nThe group's principal source of funding (the revolving credit facility) extends beyond the Going Concern period (to 2025/2026) and we have not identified plausible scenarios where management would need to source additional or alternative sources of cash during the going concern period.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the period of to 31 December 2022.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope       | \u00b7  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 20 components, audit procedures on specific  balances for a further 17 components and specified procedures for 4 components. \u00b7  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 95% of adjusted profit  before tax, 94% of Revenue and 93% of Total assets.   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | \u00b7  Impairment of certain power stations; \u00b7  Group and parent pension obligations; \u00b7  Accounting for estimated revenue recognised; \u00b7  Accounting for the SSE disposal programme.                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Materiality       | \u00b7  Overall group materiality of \u00a354.1m which represents 5% of adjusted Profit before tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n## An overview of the scope of the parent company and group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the group financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent Internal Audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 131 (2020: 141) reporting components of the group, we selected 37 components (including the parent entity) covering entities within the UK and Ireland, which represent the principal business units within the group.\n\nOf the 37 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 20 (2020: 19) components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 17 (2020: 21) components selected ('specific scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 95% (2020: 94%) of the group's adjusted Profit before tax, 94% (2020: 92%) of the group's Revenue and 93% (2020: 87%) of the group's Total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 56% (2020: 62%) of the group's adjusted Profit before tax, 92% (2020: 91%) of the group's Revenue and 83% (2020: 74%) of the group's Total assets. The specific scope component contributed 39% (2020: 32%) of the group's adjusted profit before tax, 2% (2020: 1%) of the group's Revenue and 10% (2020: 13%) of the group's Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant tested for the group. We also instructed 4 location to perform specified procedures over certain aspects of cash and bank due to significant balances held within that location.",

For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, intercompany eliminations and obtaining audit evidence to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the group financial statements.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Changes from the prior year\n\nThere have been minimal changes in scoping from the prior year, with one new full scope entity included within the Airtricity division to maintain overall coverage after disposals in the period.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 20 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these directly by the primary audit team.\n\nFor the 18 full scope and 17 specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group as a whole. The majority of specific scope components were led by the lead audit engagement partner, Annie Graham. For the remaining entities there were regular calls held between the lead audit engagement partner and component partners, with file reviews performed by the primary team over audit documentation that has not been retained within the group canvas file.\n\nFollowing the move to remote working during the year-end audit in the prior year, the current year audit was also required to be conducted remotely due to coronavirus restrictions and social distancing requirements at both component and Group locations. This was supported through remote access to the group's financial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence. Due to coronavirus, we have been unable to perform physical site visits due to travel restrictions. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers, were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and virtually attended closing meetings. This, together with the additional procedures performed at group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the group financial statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

We performed a fully substantive audit approach rather than testing the operating effectiveness of key controls.\n\n## Assessing management experts:\n\nWe have assessed the independence, objectivity and competence of the group's external actuaries, which included understanding of the scope of services being provided and considering the appropriateness of the qualifications of the external actuary.\n\n## Assessing source data:\n\nWe tested a sample of the membership data used by the actuaries to the group's records.\n\n## Benchmarking assumptions:\n\nWith the support of our pension actuarial specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions adopted by the directors by comparing them to the expectations of our pension actuarial specialists which they had derived from broader market data.\n\n## Disclosure:\n\nWe considered the adequacy of IAS 19 disclosures, including presentation of commitments associated with deficit recovery plans and in respect of sensitivity of the obligation to the key assumptions.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe conclude that management's actuarial assumptions are appropriate and fall within a central range or have been deemed an appropriate assumption basis. We are satisfied with the adequacy of disclosure within the financial statements.",

Testing was performed covering 100% of the balance in Business Energy which accounts for 73% of the unbilled balance at 31 March 2021.\n\nAll audit work in relation to this key audit matter was undertaken by the component audit teams with oversight from the group audit team.\n\n## Audit methodology:\n\nOur response to the assessed risk included understanding and testing selected IT general and application key controls, substantive audit procedures and revenue data analytics.\n\n## Tests of detail:\n\nWe agreed the opening unbilled accrued income to the closing 31 March 2020 balance sheet, agreed the volume data for customer usage of energy in the year used in the calculation to external settlement systems and agreed the volume data in relation to customer billings for the year to SSE's internal billing systems.\n\nWe have tested the unbilled unit pricing by agreeing historical pricing to sample bills, sensitising the pricing, testing a sample of billing dates from the listing to confirm billing frequency and agreeing to post year end billing prices.\n\nWe have understood and tested the historical accuracy of management's forecasting of unbilled revenue.\n\nWe assessed the impact of coronavirus on demand and consumption volatility and benchmarked assumptions in the underlying unbilled calculations to external publications from the industry.\n\n## Analytical review:\n\nWe set expectations as to the likely level of total unbilled revenue, and compared this with actual unbilled revenue, obtaining explanation for significant variances.\n\nWe compared the unbilled revenue estimation to benchmark expectation. Benchmark was derived from the external settlements data combined with billing frequency at an MPAN (Meter Point Administration Number) level, usage and price movement from last billing date to year end. We have analysed and assessed explanations for variances arising from benchmark and the appropriateness of manual adjustments made by management.\n\n## Disclosure:\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the group's disclosures about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at the estimated revenue.\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe have performed our procedures over revenue within the Business Energy business and we are satisfied that the accrued revenue recognised by management in relation to unbilled revenue is appropriately recognised.",

In the current year, this has been amended to cover the full disposal programme 'Accounting for the SSE disposal programme'.\n\nIn the prior year, our auditor's report also included a key audit matter in relation to 'First year audit transition', which was designed to be a one-off key audit matter relating to the audit transition between KPMG and EY for the 31 March 2020 audit.\n\nOur auditor's report also included a key audit matter in relation to 'Impact of coronavirus, including the group's Going Concern Assessment'. As a result of the continued resilience of SSE plc and accurate forecasting of the coronavirus impact on the performance to 31 March 2021, this key audit matter has been removed. Please refer to page 298 \uf150 for coronavirus considerations in relation to our audit procedures.\n\n## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the group to be \u00a354.1 million (2020: \u00a348.8 million), which is 5% (2020: 5%) of adjusted Profit before tax. We believe that adjusted Profit before tax provides us with a consistent measure of underlying year-on-year performance as it excludes the impact of non-recurring items as well as recurring items (namely movement on operating and financing derivatives) which can significantly fluctuate year-on-year and do not provide a true picture of the profit benchmark that would affect the decisions of the users of the financial statements.",

The materiality has been capped at the group materiality of \u00a354.1 million (2020: \u00a348.8m).\n\n| Starting basis   | \u00b7  Profit Before Tax - \u00a32,516.4m                                                                                                 |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjustments      | \u00b7  Movement on operating and financing derivatives - (\u00a3655.2m) \u00b7  Non-recurring exceptional items - (\u00a3824.1)m \u00b7  JV tax - \u00a344.5m |\n| Materiality      | \u00b7  Totals \u00a31,081.6m adjusted Profit before tax \u00b7  Materiality of \u00a354.1m (5% of materaility basis)                                |\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2020: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a327.0m (2020: \u00a324.4m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the differences identified during the prior year audit.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a33.9m to \u00a37.9m (2020: \u00a34.2m to \u00a39.3m). The lower allocation was driven through an expectation of coronavirus impact on the financial statements, lowering the initial materiality assessment. This was subsequently revised during the year-end audit procedures after testing had been performed by component entities.\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a32.7m (2020: \u00a32.4m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 169 \uf150 , including the strategic report and the directors' report set out on pages 2 to 93 and 94 to 169 respectively \uf150 , other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the annual report on remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 75 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 56 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 133 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 137 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 137 \uf150 ; and;\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 128 \uf150 .\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 169 \uf150 , the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code) and relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the group operates. We also considered non-compliance of regulatory requirements, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) and regulations levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority. We have spoken with the SSE head of regulation to confirm our understanding.\n- \u00b7 We understood how SSE plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company Secretary. We verified our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.",

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SSE PLC CONTINUED\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\ncontinued\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit, business area management at all full and specific scope management; and focused testing. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the annual report and accounts with all applicable requirements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the audit committee we were appointed by the company on 18 July 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2020 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 2 years, covering the years ending 31 March 2020 to 31 March 2021.\n- \u00b7 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Annie Graham (Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor Glasgow\n\n25 May 2021",

However, it should be recognised that there are differences between the two disclosures, primarily driven by the Licence requirements - these are described in the notes below and shown in the table reconciling the CSS to the financial statements.\n\n## How the accounts are presented\n\nThe financial information presented in the CSS is based on operating activities of the Group's electricity generation businesses ('Renewables' and 'Thermal Generation' segments described above) and the non-domestic electricity and gas supply business ('Business Energy' segment described above) in Great Britain. The paragraphs that follow describe how SSE's Renewable and Thermal Generation and Business Energy (non-domestic supply) businesses interact with Energy Portfolio Management (EPM), which is the Group's energy markets business. The basis of preparation defines the revenues, costs and profits of each business and describe in more detail the transfer pricing arrangements in place for the financial year ended 31 March 2021. The CSS has been prepared on a going concern basis as set out in Note A6.3 of SSE plc's Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Summary\n\nThe Group's 'Renewables' business sells electricity and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) from onshore and offshore windfarms and qualifying hydro to the Group's EPM business.\n\n'Thermal Generation' sells electricity in respect of coal and gas generation to EPM. It also receives external income in respect of ancillary services, balancing market participation and other contractual arrangements with third parties including government. It purchases its requirement for gas, coal, oil and carbon from EPM.\n\n'Business Energy' sells electricity and gas to circa 0.5m business customer accounts in Great Britain and procures electricity, gas and ROCs from EPM.\n\nEPM acts as a route to market for Renewables and Thermal Generation and as counterparty with the external market for the procurement of electricity and gas for SSE Energy Services and Business Energy. EPM does not form part of the CSS as it is not within the scope defined by Ofgem. The policies governing the forward hedging activity undertaken by EPM are overseen by Energy Markets Risk Committee, whose responsibilities and roles are described on page 138 \uf150 of SSE Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## Renewable Electricity Generation\n\nThe Renewables profit and loss account above is based on the Group's electricity generation activity derived from sources where no fuel is consumed to produce electricity and includes wind, hydro and pump storage powered generation.\n\nRenewables as presented in the CSS includes revenue and operating profit for wholly owned renewable generation assets and also a proportion of turnover and operating profit in respect of joint ventures, joint operations and associate generation companies 1 . The principal Joint Ventures, Joint Operations and Associates included are Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited, Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Limited, Stronelairg Windfarm Limited, Dunmaglass Windfarm Limited, Walney (UK) Offshore Windfarms Ltd (disposed 1 September 2020 and excluded beyond this date) and Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Ltd. A full list can be found in Note A3 of SSE's audited financial statements.\n\nThe Renewables profitability statement bears the risks and rewards for plant performance and renewable generation output, changes in the power price achieved for renewable generation and the impact of weather.\n\nIndividual line items in the Renewables profit and loss account above are comprised of:\n\nRevenue From Sales of Electricity revenue is recognised as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is sold to the wholesale market through EPM at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation. Revenue includes the sale of ROCs generated from qualifying plant to EPM. Generation volumes are the volume of power actually sold to the wholesale market.\n\nOther Revenue includes ancillary services, capacity income, balancing market participation and other miscellaneous income.\n\nTransportation Costs include Use of System charges and market participation costs.\n\nOther Direct Costs include power purchase agreement ('PPA') costs, site costs and management charges from EPM.\n\nIndirect Costs include salaries and other people costs, asset maintenance, rates, corporate costs and IT charges.\n\nDepreciation and Amortisation the depreciation shown in the CSS is the underlying charge based on the useful remaining life of the assets.\n\n## Thermal Electricity Generation\n\nThe Thermal profit and loss account above is based on the Group's conventional (thermal) electricity generation activity. Conventional generation is considered to be any generation where fuel is consumed to produce electricity and includes gas and waste fuelled generation. The Group closed its last remaining coal fired power station in March 2020 and no revenue was derived from this generation source in the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nThermal Generation as presented in the CSS includes revenue and operating profit for wholly owned thermal generation assets and also a proportion of turnover and operating profit in respect of joint ventures 2 . The principal joint ventures included are Seabank Power Ltd, Marchwood Power Ltd and Multifuel Energy Ltd (disposed 13 October 2020 and excluded beyond that date). A full list can be found in Note A3 of SSE's audited financial statements.\n\n- 1 The Power Purchase Agreements ('PPAs') that SSE has with its joint venture companies Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Limited, Stronelairg Windfarm Limited and Dunmaglass Windfarm Limited provide SSE with contractual entitlement to 100% of the output of the windfarms. Accordingly, SSE has reported its rights to those volumes within its Renewables statistics and has also, as mandated by Ofgem, included 50% of the JV revenue in the CSS.\n- 2 The tolling arrangements that SSE has with its joint venture companies Seabank Power Ltd, Marchwood Power Ltd and Multifuel Energy Limited provide SSE with contractual entitlement to 100% of the output of the power stations. Accordingly, SSE has reported its rights to those volumes within its Thermal Generation statistics and has also, as mandated by Ofgem, included 50% of the JV revenue in the CSS.",

        "page_content": "## CONSOLIDATED SEGMENTAL STATEMENT CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021\n\n## Thermal Electricity Generation continued\n\nThe Thermal Generation profitability statement bears the risks and rewards for plant performance, changes in market 'spark' (the marginal profit for generating electricity by gas), changes in government and EU policy particularly surrounding emissions.\n\nIndividual line items in the Thermal profit and loss account above are comprised of:\n\nRevenue From Sales of Electricity revenue is recognised as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is sold to the wholesale market through EPM at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation. Generation volumes are the volume of power actually sold to the wholesale market.\n\nOther Revenue includes ancillary services, capacity income, balancing market participation and other miscellaneous income.\n\nDirect Fuel Costs Thermal Generation procures fuel and carbon from EPM at wholesale market prices. The cost of fuel also includes the long term external purchase contracts and the impact of financial hedges. The WACOF (weighted average cost of fuel) calculation includes the costs of carbon emissions (reported in the environmental and social obligations cost line in the CSS).\n\nTransportation Costs include Use of System charges and market participation costs.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Costs include carbon costs (EUETS and Carbon Price Floor).\n\nOther Direct Costs include power purchase agreement ('PPA') costs, site costs and management charges from EPM.\n\nIndirect Costs include salaries and other people costs, asset maintenance, rates, corporate costs and IT charges.\n\nDepreciation and Amortisation the depreciation shown in the CSS is the underlying charge based on the useful remaining life of the assets and excludes exceptional asset impairments.\n\n## Business Energy (Non-domestic)\n\nRevenue from Sales of Electricity and Gas revenues are the value of electricity and gas supplied to business customers in Great Britain during the year and includes an estimate of the value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. Non-domestic volumes are expressed at customer meter point, net of transmission and distribution losses and are based on external settlements data.\n\nDirect Fuel Costs Business Energy does not engage in the trading of electricity and gas and procures all of its electricity and gas from EPM. The method by which EPM procures energy at an arm's length arrangement on behalf of Business Energy is governed by Business Energy's forward hedging policy. The forward trades between Business Energy and EPM are priced at wholesale market prices at the time of execution and any differences in volume and reconciliation at the time of delivery is marked to the spot price on the day. WACOG (weighted average cost of gas) also includes the energy cost element of Reconciliation by Difference (RbD) and Unidentified Gas. The WACOE and WACOG also consist of trades marked to wholesale prices when committed at the point of sale for fixed price customer contracts or when a customer instructs SSE to purchase energy in respect of flexi-priced contracts. This transfer pricing methodology reflects how Business Energy actually acquired its energy. There have been no material changes in the transfer pricing policy in respect of Business Energy since the CSS for the financial year ending 31 March 2020.\n\nTransportation Costs these are network type costs and include: electricity transmission and distribution use of system costs; gas transportation costs including the transportation element of RbD and market participation costs.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Obligation Costs relate to policies designed to modernise and decarbonise the energy system in Great Britain and include ROCs, Feed in Tariff, charges under the Capacity Mechanism and CfD schemes and charges in relation to 'assistance for areas with high electricity distribution costs' (AAHEDC).\n\nOther Direct Costs include: settlement costs, management charges from EPM and other miscellaneous costs.\n\nIndirect Costs include: sales and marketing, customer service, bad debts, commercial costs, central costs - including information technology, property, corporate, telecoms costs, metering asset and meter reading costs and operational Smart Metering costs (net of revenues). Where costs cannot be directly allocated to a fuel (electricity/gas), they have been allocated using costing models based on activity, customer billing or customer numbers - whichever is the most appropriate.\n\nBusiness Energy's profit and loss account bears the risk and rewards arising from the volatility in demand for energy, caused by the weather, consumption per customer and customer churn. It is also exposed to swings in wholesale costs and the uncertainty surrounding government environmental and social schemes.",

There are items which are in the financial statements and not in the CSS; and also there are items which Ofgem has requested be included in the CSS which are not in the financial statements.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Exceptional items relate to bad debt charges related to coronavirus, which have been classified as exceptional within SSE's financial statements.\n- 2 Non-GB Electricity Generation relates to SSE's Renewables business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n- 3 SSE applies equity accounting for its investments in JVs and Associates (which means it only includes its share of the profits/losses), in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Ofgem mandated basis of preparation of the CSS requires that the proportionate share of revenue, costs and profits are shown in the CSS. The revenue shown in the CSS for JVs and Associates is not present in the financial statements and is therefore a reconciling item. The share of profits however are present in both CSS and financial statements, therefore no reconciliation is necessary.\n- 4 During the year the Group disposed of a 10% stake in Doggerbank A & Doggerbank B windfarms, and a 51% stake in Seagreen 1A windfarm, recognising total gain on disposal of \u00a3225.8m (see Note 12.2 of SSE's Annual Report). The gain has been excluded from the regulated revenue and profit presented in the CSS, but is included in the underlying operating profit within the financial statements in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for such divestments.\n- 5 Non-GB Electricity Generation relates to SSE's Thermal business in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n## Adjustments to reported profit before tax\n\nSSE focuses its internal and external reporting on 'adjusted profit before tax' which excludes exceptional items, re-measurements arising from IFRS 9, depreciation on fair value uplifts and removes taxation on profits of joint ventures and associates, because this reflects the underlying profits of SSE, reflects the basis on which it is managed and avoids the volatility that arises out of IFRS 9. Therefore, these items have been excluded from the CSS.",

        "page_content": "## CSS AUDIT OPINION\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of SSE plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 March 2021, which comprise the Consolidated Segmental Statement (CSS), Basis of preparation, Reconciliation of CSS to the Annual Report of SSE plc and the related disclosure notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is a special purpose framework comprising the financial reporting provisions of Ofgem's Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licences.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying CSS of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2021 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 307 to 311 \uf150 .\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) including 'ISA (UK) 800 (Revised) Special Considerations - Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks'. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 19 months through to 31 December 2022.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Emphasis of matter - basis of accounting and restriction on distribution and use\n\nWe draw attention to pages 307 to 311 \uf150 , which describes the basis of accounting. The CSS is prepared to assist the Company in complying with the financial reporting provisions of the contract referred to above. As a result, the CSS may not be suitable for another purpose. Our report is intended solely for the Company, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 23 March 2021, and should not be distributed to or used by parties other than the Company. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the CSS and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the CSS does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the CSS itself. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of Ofgem's Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licences, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the CSS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the CSS, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.",

        "page_content": "## CSS AUDIT OPINION CONTINUED\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the company and determined that the most significant for preparation of the CSS is compliance with Ofgem.\n- \u00b7 We understood how SSE plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management and those charged with governance to understand how the Company maintains and communicates its policies and procedures in these areas and corroborated this by reviewing supporting documentation. We also reviewed correspondence with relevant authorities.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's CSS to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by considering the risk of manipulation of the CSS reconciliation. We vouched information back to supporting documentation and agreed to audited numbers within the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved making enquiries with the entity's in-house legal counsel, and circulating enquiry letters to external legal counsel to confirm our understanding of matters communicated by the Company.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matter\n\nWe have reported separately on the statutory financial statements of SSE plc.\n\n## Ernst & Young LLP\n\nGlasgow 25 May 2021",

It includes a dedicated investors section where you can find electronic copies of Company reports and further information about shareholder services including:\n\n- \u00b7 share price information;\n- \u00b7 dividend history and trading graphs;\n- \u00b7 the Scrip Dividend Scheme;\n- \u00b7 telephone and internet share dealing; and\n- \u00b7 downloadable shareholder forms.\n\n## Digital news\n\nSSE uses a dedicated news and views website (available at www.sse.com/news-and-views \uf295 ) and Twitter ( www.twitter.com/ sse \uf295 ) to keep shareholders, investors, journalists, employees and other interested parties up-to-date with news from the Company.\n\n## Sustainable communications\n\nSSE is seeking to implement a sustainable communications strategy which reduces the volume of paper being used in its communications with shareholders and other stakeholders. This is in line with SSE's sustainability values and approach to providing a more environmentally-friendly service. The first step in this strategy was the move away from paper dividend cheques in 2019/20 and SSE continues to encourage shareholders to use online services to manage their holding.\n\nThrough the dedicated Shareholder Portal provided by Link Registrars at www.sse-shares.com/ \uf295 shareholders can:\n\n- \u00b7 Elect for electronic communications. By joining our eCommunications Programme and choosing to receive shareholder documents electronically. Shareholders are notified by email that documents such as the Annual Report or Notice of Annual General Meeting are available on our website.\n- \u00b7 Update personal details.\n- \u00b7 Buy and sell shares online using Link's share dealing service.\n- \u00b7 Vote in advance of company general meetings.\n\nIf you have not used this service before, you will require your Investor Code (IVC) to register. You will find this on your share certificate.\n\n## Removal of dividend confirmations\n\nAs part of SSE's commitment to a more environmentally friendly service, following the removal of cheques in 2019/20, the Company intends to take the next step in its paperless dividend strategy. In 2022, dividend confirmations will only be available online. If you are an ordinary shareholder and have not yet elected to receive your dividend communication electronically please register at www.sse-shares.com \uf295 ;\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Company typically pays dividends twice yearly. Interim dividends are paid in March, and final dividends are paid in September once approved by shareholders at the AGM. With significant focus on payment methods for dividends in recent years, in terms of efficiency, cost and security, SSE plc made the decision that from September 2019, it would no longer be paying dividends by cheque. All dividends are now credited to a shareholder's nominated UK bank/building society account.\n\nIf you haven't already registered your UK bank/building society account details with Link Registrar or would like to amend the details on your account, you can do this by:\n\n- \u00b7 logging in to the dedicated Shareholder Portal at www.sse-shares.com \uf295 ; or\n- \u00b7 calling Link on 0345 143 4005 and speaking to one of the team.\n\nIf you do not have a UK bank or building society account, your dividends can be paid directly into a bank account outside of the UK using the International Payment service. Please visit http://ips.linkassetservices.com/ \uf295 for further information.\n\nAlternatively, shareholders may want to join the Scrip dividend alternative and receive future dividends in the form of additional new shares. Further details of the Scrip scheme can be found at www.sse.com/investors/shareholder-services/dividends-andscrip-scheme/ \uf295 . You should still complete a bank mandate to enable future dividend payments should you ever withdraw from the Scrip scheme.\n\n## Amalgamation of multiple share accounts\n\nMany shareholders receive several copies of the Annual Report and dividend documentation who could merge their shareholdings. If you receive more than one copy of these documents you could help SSE reduce its impact on the environment and save paper by merging your accounts into one. Please contact Link Asset Services to amalgamate your accounts or visit www.sse.com/investors/ shareholder-services/shareholder-forms/ \uf295",

The terms of the offer through which the merger was effected was that for every Southern Electric plc ordinary share held, shareholders received one Scottish and Southern Energy plc (now SSE plc) ordinary share. A number of shareholders did not respond to the original merger offer, resulting in subsequent tracing communications over the following years. In 2017, more than 12 years after the formation of SSE, a complete tracing programme was initiated through the asset reunification company Capita Employee Benefits (Consulting) Limited (Capita Tracing), to locate dissentient shareholders and reunite them with their funds. The steps agreed were designed to enable the best possible outcome for dissentient shareholders and provided clear details of the actions required to claim their asset entitlement. Following the completion of all reasonable steps over \u00a32m (in a combination of shares and accrued dividends) was returned to dissentient shareholders. As required by the Companies Act 2006, the remainder totalling over \u00a39m was transferred to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. Unclaimed monies can still be claimed through direct application to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. The process for making such an application was provided to outstanding claimants and further details are provided at www.sse.com/investors/shareholderservices/useful-information/southern-electric-unclaimeddividends/ \uf295 .\n\n## Keep us informed\n\nKeep us informed of changes to your email address by visiting www.sse.com/investors/shareholder-services/usefulinformation/ecomms/ \uf295 and follow the instructions under 'how to register or update your email address'.",
