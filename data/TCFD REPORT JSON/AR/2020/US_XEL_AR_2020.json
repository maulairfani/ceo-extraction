He originally planned to focus on the clean energy transition and COVID-19 recovery, but two weeks before his one-year term began, Ben and most of the country saw the footage of George Floyd's death while in police custody in south Minneapolis.\n\nCalling the incident that occurred only a few miles from Xcel Energy's corporate headquarters 'an awakening,' Ben knew that addressing racial equity was too important to not include in his platform. Ben, who was named 2020 Executive of the Year by Utility Dive, quickly rallied the industry and gained commitments from 57 CEOs to address racial equity in their companies and communities, starting with four core principles: 1) Ensuring diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are driven from the top 2) Removing barriers to entry and broadening talent pools 3) Establishing strong community connections, and 4) Developing infrastructure academies and training programs.\n\nXcel Energy added a diversity, equity and inclusion corporate scorecard metric for 2021, tying executive and employee compensation to demonstrate our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and improved hiring and sponsorship practices. This metric is designed to create accountability in our leadership team and the company as a whole to reduce the barriers to a diverse workforce.\n\n## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\n|                               | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total GAAP earnings per share | 2.64   | 2.79   |\n| Ongoing earnings per share    | 2.64   | 2.79   |\n| Dividends annualized          | 1.62   | 1.72   |\n| Stock price (close)           | 63.49  | 66.67  |\n| Assets (millions)             | 50,448 | 53,957 |\n\n## COMPANY DESCRIPTION\n\nXcel Energy is a major U.S. electric and natural gas company with annual revenues of $11.5 billion.

In the face of a global pandemic, a severe economic downturn and widespread civil unrest, we delivered on our GLYPH<31>nancial and operational objectives while simultaneously mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 and supporting our communities like never before.\n\nWe continue to lead the clean energy transition and make excellent progress toward our vision to provide 100% carbon-free electricity for our customers by 2050. At the end of 2020, 47% of the energy we produced came from carbon-free sources. That number will continue to climb as we execute our plans to retire coal plants, build large-scale renewable projects, preserve our high-performing nuclear GLYPH<30>eet and maintain natural gas as a bridge and backup fuel. A diversiGLYPH<31>ed energy mix is critical during this transition to enhance reliability and keep customer bills low.\n\nWe've reduced carbon emissions 51% since 2005 - halfway to our 2050 goal and ahead of schedule - and we are creating concrete pathways to reach our 80% reduction goal by 2030. I'm encouraged by the opportunity to take our increasingly green product and reduce carbon from the transportation sector. Last year, we announced a bold vision to power 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service areas by the end of 2030 (see story on pages 6-8) and launched a comprehensive strategy to lower greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas business.\n\nFor me, 2020 will always be remembered as the year that our employees delivered for our customers and communities in extraordinary times. We never take for granted the trust you place in us to power the homes and businesses of our customers all day, every day. It's a tremendous responsibility that took on additional meaning during this global pandemic.",

        "page_content": "We chose 'Essential' as the theme for this report because of the essential role we play in our communities and in our society. Electricity and natural gas are essential services provided by our essential workers who take great pride in their ability to deliver for their neighbors. We also play a vital role in driving economic development and giving back through the Xcel Energy Foundation. Last year, we earmarked $20 million in short- and long-term corporate giving, including support for COVID-19 recovery and racial justice (see story on pages 16-18).\n\nI take great pride in our team's resiliency, determination and /flexibility last year as we learned to work differently, keep each other safe and deliver for our customers, our communities and you, our valued shareholders.\n\n## STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nFor the 16th consecutive year, we met or exceeded our earnings guidance. We delivered 2020 earnings of $2.79 per share, within our original earnings guidance range of $2.73-$2.83 per share, compared to $2.64 per share in 2019. Although electric sales declined approximately 3% due to the economic downturn, we successfully implemented continuous improvement initiatives and other cost control measures that reduced our O&M expenses by nearly 1%.\n\nXcel Energy also increased your dividend by 6.2%, or 10 cents annually in 2020. We maintained our earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7% annually, re/flecting our con/fidence in our long-term /financial plan. In February 2021, we increased the dividend 6.4%, or 11 cents on an annual basis, extending our streak of dividend growth to 18 consecutive years.\n\nAs a result of our continued strong performance, our one-year total shareholder return exceeded 7.8% in 2020, which was the second highest in our peer group. We also compare favorably to our peer group and the S&P 500 for three-, /fiveand 10-year performance results.\n\nDue to the sound execution of our strategic priorities - leading the clean energy transition, enhancing the customer experience and keeping bills low - we remain well positioned to deliver for our customers and shareholders in 2021 and beyond.\n\n## STEEL FOR FUEL EXECUTION\n\nOur Steel for Fuel growth strategy - building wind farms that deliver both economic and environmental bene/fits for our customers and stakeholders - continues to drive organic growth for the company. Under Steel for Fuel, we add carbon-free renewable energy - the 'steel' - allowing our customers to avoid the cost of fuel that would otherwise be used to produce electricity in traditional generating plants. This strategy keeps customer bills low, drives economic development and generates an attractive shareholder return.\n\nIn the last year, we added nearly 1,500 megawatts of company-owned wind to our system, including large self-build projects in Colorado, Minnesota and New Mexico. In 2021, we will complete the four remaining projects in our nation-leading multi-state wind expansion that began in 2017. With completion of those remaining projects, the total wind on our system will grow to approximately 11,000 megawatts, including nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind capacity (see story on pages 12-13).\n\nOur investments in wind will continue longer term, including wind repowering projects where we replace aging equipment with the latest technology to increase wind farm ef/ficiency and save customers money. We completed two wind repowering projects in 2020 and received approval in December to repower four projects in the Upper Midwest to help stimulate the economy (see story on page 9).\n\n## OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\n\nDelivering natural gas and electricity took on even greater prominence during the pandemic, and our workforce delivered while adjusting to enhanced safety precautions (see story on pages 14-15). We met or exceeded goals on all 2020 corporate scorecard metrics, including customer satisfaction, wind deployment, employee safety, public safety and electric system reliability.\n\nOperational highlights include our J.D. Power customer satisfaction score improving by 40 points to our highest rating ever. The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations rated our nuclear /fleet as the best in the nation - we achieved a",

As an example, in 2020 we entered into partnership with the Department of Energy to test the viability of producing carbon-free hydrogen at one of our nuclear plants.\n\n## BEST IN THE BUSINESS\n\nResiliency and GLYPH<30>exibility are characteristics that we seek in our generation assets, but this year those terms accurately describe our employees that I believe are the best in the business. It's an honor and a privilege to lead this team that is so committed to serving our customers and living our values: Committed, Connected, Safe and Trustworthy.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that our employees continue to receive recognition for their efforts and our workplace culture. For the eighth consecutive year, we were selected for Fortune Magazine's 'World's Most Admired' companies list.

Our GLYPH<31>eld crews received two EEI Emergency Recovery Awards for their efforts to restore service following Winter Storm Billy, an October ice storm that caused signiGLYPH<31>cant damage to the grid in Texas, and for restoring power to 135,000 Minnesota residents following a summer storm that rolled through the Twin Cities.\n\n96% capacity factor and successfully executed a refueling at Prairie Island during the pandemic. And we began the pivotal evolution of our safety approach that focuses on eliminating serious injuries and fatalities. Under this 'Safety Always' approach, we are developing a culture of enhanced trust and transparency with our employees, giving them the opportunity to learn from their experiences and continuously improve the safety of their work environment.\n\n## REGULATORY PROGRESS\n\nWe achieved constructive outcomes in numerous regulatory proceedings in 2020, including rate case settlements in New Mexico, Texas and Colorado and approval of our proposal to avoid moving forward with a rate case in Minnesota when many customers are struggling GLYPH<31>nancially. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission continues to review our resource plan that will determine the future energy mix in the Upper Midwest, and we expect a decision in 2021.\n\nWe recently GLYPH<31>led a Colorado Clean Energy Plan that includes adding 5,500 MW of wind, solar and energy storage. It also proposes the early retirement or conversion to natural gas of our remaining coal plants in Colorado. If approved along with a supplemental GLYPH<31>ling to expand the transmission network in the state, we expect to generate approximately 80% of our energy from renewable sources in Colorado by 2030, reducing our carbon emissions by approximately 85% from 2005 levels while maintaining system reliability and customer affordability. We also came to a resolution with the City of Boulder for a new 20-year franchise agreement.\n\nTo support our vision of powering 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service areas by 2030, we GLYPH<31>led transportation electriGLYPH<31>cation plans in Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico and Wisconsin and gained approval for new home charging programs in Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nAs we look at 2021, we know that there are challenges ahead. We've already seen the impact of a historic cold snap, and although the rollout of vaccines provides renewed optimism that we can put COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, the pandemic is not over.\n\nBut our performance in 2020 is a reason for optimism. Regardless of whatever new challenges arise, you can count on the Xcel Energy team to deliver for you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBen Fowke Chairman and Chief Executive Of/ficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we look to achieve our vision of producing 100% carbon-free electricity for our customers by 2050, we initiated the Carbon-free Technology Initiative.

'A growing percentage of customers want their next car purchase to be an EV. That just wasn't the case a few years back. They see the trend and want to take advantage of the economic and environmental bene/fits.'\n\nThose bene/fits include: no oil changes or engine maintenance; low-cost overnight charging instead of /filling up at the gas pump; reduced emissions; generous rebates and tax credits; and improved battery technology compared to earlier models.\n\nGeneral Motors recently announced its plans to phase out the production of gas and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035, and other automakers are expected to announce similar goals.\n\n'Electric vehicle adoption will grow substantially in the coming years, and we want to be at the leading edge of that wave - powering the cars with our clean, affordable energy, while also providing our customers with the programs they\n\nwant - from innovative community electric rideshare partnerships to installing at-home chargers with an easy process,' said Brett Carter, Chief Customer and Innovation Of/ficer at Xcel Energy.

Our customers can charge their EVs overnight at off-peak rates for the equivalent of less than $1 per gallon of gas. Over the course of a year, those fuel savings can add up to an average of $700.\n\nEV adoption is tailor-made for Xcel Energy's three strategic priorities: leading the clean energy transition, enhancing the customer experience and keeping bills low for customers.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shutdowns of indoor dining have devastated restaurants like Bistro Vendome. To keep their doors open many Colorado eateries have expanded or renovated their outdoor spaces to provide patrons with a safe, warm dining experience.\n\nBistro Vendome is one of nearly 400 restaurants in more than 30 Colorado counties to receive a grant from the Winter Outdoor Dining Fund, which the Xcel Energy Foundation kickstarted with a pledge of $750,000 and an initial gift of $500,000. Launched in November 2020 in partnership with the State of Colorado and the Colorado Restaurant Association, the program awards restaurants with grants of up to $10,000 to winterize their outdoor spaces with igloos, heaters, tents and more.\n\nWith the grant funds, Bistro Vendome converted its cozy European courtyard hidden by brick walls and shady trees into a large, yet intimate insulated tent /flecked with string lights.\n\n'We are grateful to Xcel Energy and other partners for their efforts to help Colorado restaurants survive this winter,' said Beth Gruitch, co-partner of Crafted Concepts, which owns Bistro Vendome. 'With COVID-19 restrictions, it would have been dif/ficult to stay open without the revenue from our winterized outdoor dining area.'\n\n'Powering the homes and businesses of our communities and keeping our customers\n\nwarm this winter is not enough,' said Hollie Velasquez Horvath, Senior Director, State Affairs and Community Relations in Colorado. 'We hope this contribution will help Colorado restaurants thrive, while also providing customers a safe and fun dining experience this winter and beyond.'\n\nThe economic shutdown caused by the global pandemic has hurt many businesses, especially in the hospitality industry. As a company literally embedded in the communities we are privileged to serve, Xcel Energy created a strategy in 2020 to help our customers weather the challenges as best as possible.\n\nWe were among the /first companies in the industry to suspend disconnections of residential customers behind on their bills and are partnering with customers to set up repayment plans that work for them. We also worked closely with business customers to inform them about federal government loan programs. In Minnesota, the Public Utilities Commission agreed with our recommendation to provide a temporary electric rate discount for business customers affected by the shutdowns.\n\nAccount Manager Sara Terrell received a thank-you note from a large hotel in downtown Minneapolis that said in part: 'Our business has suffered a $7 million loss this year, and our staf/fing levels have been reduced to the bare bones. So, when I say we are grateful, I can't /find a way to fully express that in words. But the savings provided with this discounted electric rate are helping to keep good people employed.'\n\nXcel Energy account managers were in constant contact with their business customers to offer our help.\n\n'Our customers just wanted someone in their corner to listen to their struggles and lend a hand if possible,' said Chris Conrad, Director of Account Management in Minnesota.

The company has committed to help local businesses rebuild with free energy design assistance and double rebates on qualifying energy ef/ficient purchases such as HVAC and lighting systems.\n\nIn early 2021, the Xcel Energy Foundation announced $350,000 in grants to 14 nonpro/fit organizations to fund racial equity programs and rebuild communities in Minneapolis and St. Paul. That comes on the heels of a $300,000 donation to help fund North Star Learning Pods, an innovative program to help reduce the achievement gap for black and minority students. Located at local churches and community centers, learning pods feature tutoring, enrichment experiences and reliable internet connections for hundreds\n\nof students to make distance learning more effective in a school year disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also supported six nonpro/fits striving for racial equity in Colorado in addition to efforts in our other states.\n\nAs a company, we aim to create an inclusive work culture where employees are treated equitably, and diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Our CEO and senior executives lead by example, fostering an open and accepting work environment through their communications and interactions, which include holding crucial conversations on race relations. We provide enterprise-wide learnings such as unconscious bias and microinequities training, and we sponsor 10 business resource groups to support employee interests and assist the organization in solving challenges and achieving goals. However, our commitment goes beyond programs, policies and practices - we strive for diversity, equity and inclusion ('DEI') to be an integral part of who we are, how we operate and how we see our future. We are committed to progress and will measure our progress through corporate scorecard metrics that include, among other things, employee feedback on our engagement survey inclusion index, the use of diverse hiring interview panels and an executive sponsorship program.\n\n## COVID-19 RELIEF\n\nTo provide /financial relief for communities hard-hit by COVID-19, the company donated $100,000 to six regional and community foundations and three tribal nations in Wisconsin, the /first of several contributions across our service territory. In addition to our foundation monetary\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, three employees developed a solution for the ear discomfort many people were experiencing when wearing masks all day. Using a 3-D printer, they created a simple plastic extender that connects to a mask's elastic bands, eliminating the discomfort. The trio initially made 1,900 for Xcel Energy employees, but after hearing that the pieces are expensive for the health care community, they produced thousands of ear protectors a week to donate to frontline health care providers in the Upper Midwest.\n\n## THANKING HEALTH CARE WORKERS\n\nOne morning in the spring of 2020, hospital workers at two St. Paul hospitals - Regions and Bethesda - received a unique thank you gesture from 60 Xcel Energy employees.\n\nWith dozens of bucket trucks and other vehicles, our employees arrived for the morning shift change to thank the health care workers and /first responders. Banners with messages of support hung from hoisted buckets, and company employees lined the sidewalks to applaud the medical workers who were either arriving to start their day or just /finishing their shift.\n\n'It was the most rewarding day of my career. The raw emotion that we saw and felt that day was awesome. I don't think I'll see anything like that again,' said Mitch Quinnell, an Operations Manager based in St. Paul.\n\nMegan Remark, President and CEO of Regions Hospital, agreed. 'I want you to know that everywhere I walked at Regions Hospital the following morning,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI heard our teams talking about what an amazing morale boost your Xcel Energy team gave all of our caregivers,' she wrote in an email. 'As you know, essential workers like your team and our team are ready 24/7 to solve any problem and are ready to be there for everyone who needs us. Your grand gesture will live in the minds of our caregivers forever.'\n\n## GIVING BACK\n\nOur employees have always stepped up to play a signi/ficant role in supporting our communities, and that was especially true during the pandemic. The Xcel Energy Foundation encouraged employee giving to their favorite nonpro/fits with a special 2-for-1 match, resulting in $450,000 of contributions to organizations that needed support more than ever. In total, our employees and the Foundation invested nearly $13 million in our communities in 2020. That includes another successful United Way campaign in which employees raised $2.5 million, exceeding the goal despite having to pivot to virtual activities.\n\nEmployees also volunteered approximately 50,000 volunteer hours last year at events like the 10th annual Xcel Energy Day of Service (virtual and modi/fied in-person opportunities) and served on more than 500 nonpro/fit boards in our communities.\n\nJohn Marshall, Director of Community Relations & Foundation, delivers special mask extenders to M Fairview Hospital. A trio of Xcel Energy employees produced them using a 3-D printer. Overall, the company donated more than 300,000 masks to hospitals, health care centers and tribal communities.",

        "page_content": "Xcel Energy strives to be the preferred and trusted provider of the energy our customers  need,  while  offering  a  competitive  total  return  to shareholders. We deliver on our vision through three strategic priorities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLead the Clean Energy Transition\n\nReducing carbon emissions 80% by 2030; 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050\n\nEnhance the Customer Experience\n\nConservation, renewable and electric vehicle offerings\n\nKeep Bills Low\n\nAverage bill increases \u2264 rate of inflation\n\n## Lead the Clean Energy Transition\n\nFor more than a decade, Xcel Energy has proactively managed the risk of climate  change  and  responded  to  increasing  customer  demand  for renewable energy. We reduced carbon emissions from generation serving customers  by  51%  from  2005  to  2020  and  are  on  track  to  reach  60% renewable generation by 2030.\n\nEnergy Mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Potential scenarios that achieve carbon reduction goal\n\nOur recently announced generation transition plans include:\n\n- \u00b7 Adding economic wind and solar resources.\n- \u00b7 Limiting  coal  generation  through  seasonal  dispatch  of  coal  facilities where possible and early retirement of coal plants (e.g., Hayden and Craig), including fully exiting coal in the upper Midwest by 2030 (e.g., Sherco).\n- \u00b7 Using natural gas as a means to ensure system reliability.\n- \u00b7 Extending the life of our Monticello nuclear plant.\n- \u00b7 Converting Harrington, our coal plant in Texas, to natural gas.\n- \u00b7 A proposal to close the Hayden coal plant, retiring Unit 2 by the end of 2027 and Unit 1 in 2028.\n- \u00b7 Retiring Craig coal plant with Unit 1 closing in 2025 and Unit 2 closing in 2028.\n\nOur March 2021 Colorado resource plan filing will outline a range of options for us to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030 in the state, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed  plans  for  our  remaining  coal  units  (approximately  1,200 MW), such as early retirements and natural gas conversions.\n- \u00b7 Additional renewables and storage.\n- \u00b7 Transmission expansion.\n\nWe are confident we can achieve our 80% interim carbon reduction goal with today's technology. New carbon-free dispatchable technologies will be required  in  order  to  achieve  the  remaining  20%  carbon  reduction. Reliability,  customer  affordability  and  innovation  remain  paramount  to  a successful transition.\n\nXcel  Energy's  clean  energy  leadership  extends  to  our  natural  gas distribution system as we work to keep our methane emissions rate below 0.2%. Our plans include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Working  with  upstream  suppliers  on  reducing  emissions  on  their system.\n- \u00b7 Reducing methane emissions from our own operations.\n- \u00b7 Designing  programs  that  encourage  customer  conservation  and electrification where beneficial.\n\n## Enhance the Customer Experience\n\nXcel Energy is committed to providing programs that customers want and value.  We  continue  to  expand  renewable  offerings  and  promote  cost savings  and  conservation  programs,  in  which  we  have  invested  over  $2 billion in the past decade.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  transforming  our  electric  grid  to  accommodate  increased levels  of  renewables  and  distributed  energy  resources  and  continues  to offer customers directly sourced renewable energy solutions. We are also working  to  develop  new  programs  for  C&I  customers  who  desire  higher than standard service reliability, with the goal being to make it both easy and affordable for business customers to meet their resiliency needs.\n\nAdditionally,  we  have  partnered  with  policymakers,  state  agencies  and innovative partners to develop nation-leading electric vehicle  solutions for our  customers.  Our  electric  vehicle  plans  include  residential,  fleet  and public  charging  offerings.  In  2020,  our  residential,  flat-fee  subscription service  pilot  won  Public  Utility  Fortnightly's  Smartest  Transportation Electrification  Project  award.  Xcel  Energy  has  full  or  pilot  electric  vehicle programs underway in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin, including our $110 million, three-year Colorado plan which was approved in December 2020.\n\nIn  2020,  we  set  an  ambitious  goal  to  power  1.5  million  electric  vehicles across our service territory by 2030, which is estimated to save customers $1 billion in fueling costs and cut carbon emissions by nearly 5 million tons annually by 2030.\n\n## Keep Bills Low\n\nAffordability  is  foundational  to  our  strategy.  Our  goal  is  to  keep  bill increases at or below the rate of inflation. Xcel Energy has kept residential bills relatively flat since 2013.\n\nOur  states  benefit  from  strong  wind  and  solar  capacity  factors.  This geographic advantage, coupled with renewable tax credits and avoided fuel costs, enables Xcel Energy to increase its investment in renewables while saving customers money. We call this our 'Steel for Fuel' strategy. From 2017  to  2020,  we  added  nearly  3,000  MW  of  wind  to  our  system  while delivering approximately $430 million in fuel savings to our customers.\n\nXcel  Energy  continues  to  control  O&M  expense  without  compromising reliability or safety. Since 2014, total O&M has remained flat and we expect annual growth to remain below 1% through 2025 as declines in base O&M offset  approximately  $100  million  of  incremental  wind  O&M.  We  are continuing to prudently invest in appropriate areas and remain committed to taking  costs  out  of  the  business  through  ongoing  improvements  in processes and technology.\n\n## Deliver a Competitive Total Return to Investors and Maintain Strong Investment Grade Credit Rating\n\nSuccessful execution of our strategy, along with our disciplined approach to growth, investments, operations and management of environmental, social and  corporate  governance  issues,  positions  Xcel  Energy  to  continue delivering a competitive TSR.",

        "page_content": "## CONSISTENT DELIVERY TRANSPARENT GROWTH LEADING ESG PROFILE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  have  consistently  achieved  our  financial  objectives,  meeting  or exceeding our initial earnings guidance range for sixteen consecutive years and delivering dividend growth for seventeen consecutive years.\n\nGAAP  and  ongoing  earnings  have  grown  5.6%  and  6.1%,  respectively, annually since 2005 and our dividend grew 6.3% annually from 2013-2020. Xcel Energy works to maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range and senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Our current ratings are consistent with this objective.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership\n\nSustainability is embedded in Xcel Energy's strategy and our values:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConnected\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are retiring coal plants, adding renewables, exploring new technologies and helping to electrify other sectors, while keeping customer bills low. Xcel Energy has demonstrated leadership in mitigating climate, operational and financial  risks,  while  remaining  committed  to  customers,  employees  and communities.\n\n## Environmental\n\nXcel Energy was the first major U.S. utility to establish a carbon-free vision, targeting  100%  carbon-free  electricity  by  2050  and  an  80%  carbon reduction  by  2030  (from  2005  levels).  Our  plans  to  achieve  80%  carbon reduction  are  aligned  with  targets  of  the  Paris  Accord,  as  validated  by  a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  provided  a  voluntary,  third-party  verified  annual  GHG disclosure since 2005, longer than any other U.S. utility. We are a founding member  of  The  Climate  Registry  and  a  supporter  of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures.  We  have  been  the  number  one provider of wind to customers for 12 of the past 15 years. Our wind capacity is expected to reach 11,000 MW by the end of 2021, including nearly 4,500 MW of owned wind.\n\n## Changing Composition of Wind Capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs Xcel Energy transitions to cleaner sources, we expect to achieve a 70% reduction  in  water  consumed  in  electric  generation  by  2030  (from  2005 levels). Through 2020, we reduced our water consumption 34% (from 2005 levels).\n\n## Social\n\n## Community\n\nWe  work  to  foster  economic  sustainability  and  continued  affordability  by partnering with communities, policymakers and customers to build facilities, foster  job  growth  and  attract  new  businesses.  In  2020,  Xcel  Energy completed 20 economic development projects across our service territory. Additionally, 71% of Xcel Energy's supply chain spend was local.\n\nIn addition to our annual giving, in 2020 Xcel Energy further supported our communities  by  committing  the  net  gain  of  nearly  $20  million  from  our Mankato plant sale to short and long-term corporate giving.\n\nWe  work  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  early  plant  retirements  on  our employees and community, consistent with our Principles for a Responsible Transition.  We  provide  advanced  notice,  offer  retraining  and  relocation opportunities and have had no layoffs as a result of plant retirements. We also seek to make investments in the communities in which our coal plants are being shut down to offset the economic impact.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety  is  embedded  in  our  values  and  governance  practices,  and  Xcel Energy is focused on preventing life-altering  injuries.  All  employees  have 'stop work authority' to keep each other, our customers and the public safe. Through our Safety Always approach, employees are encouraged to share experiences  and  learn  from  events  to  help  protect  themselves,  their coworkers and the public.\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nXcel  Energy's  success  depends  on  our  ability  to  actively  implement programs  to  attract,  hire,  develop  and  retain  skilled  employees.  Our workforce  strategy  is  designed  to  put  the  best  talent  in  place,  create  a culture  that  motivates  employees  to  lead  the  way  in  achieving  our  clean energy goals and deliver an exceptional customer experience.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  implemented  a  strategic,  data-driven  approach  to workforce  and  succession  planning,  which  includes  best  practices  in learning  and  development.  Additionally,  Xcel  Energy  partners  with educational  and  community  organizations  to  attract  and  hire  diverse employees who reflect the communities we serve. Also, hiring veterans is a key focus of our workforce strategy, with approximately 10% of employees having  served  in  the  military.  Xcel  Energy  offers  its  employees  a competitive benefits package which includes: performance-based compensation, healthcare benefits, recognition programs and an employee development program that emphasizes ongoing coaching.\n\nXcel Energy views diversity, equity and inclusion as an integral part of who we are, how we operate and how we see our future. We are committed to an  inclusive  culture  where  diversity  is  celebrated  and  employees  are treated equitably. Our senior leadership team leads by example, fostering an  inclusive  work  environment,  which  recognizes  the  need  for  crucial conversations on diversity. Additionally, Xcel Energy supports an inclusive environment  by  offering  company-wide  trainings  on  topics  addressing microinequities and unconscious bias.  We hold ourselves accountable and measure  our  progress  through  corporate  scorecard  metrics  that  include, among  other  things,  employee  feedback  in  our  engagement  survey Inclusion Index.",

Xcel Energy instituted Board of Directors oversight of environmental performance in 2000 and was among the  first  U.S.  utilities  to  tie  carbon  reduction  directly  to  executive compensation over fifteen years ago.\n\nIn  2020,  60%  of  annual  incentive  pay  was  tied  to  safety  and  system reliability.  In  2021,  we  added  an  incentive-based  metric  to  reinforce  our commitment  to  diversity  and  inclusion.  Xcel  Energy  has  clear  Board  of Directors  committee  oversight  for  safety  and  our  human  capital  strategy, including diversity and inclusion initiatives.",

A strong transmission system ensures continued reliable and  affordable  service,  ability  to  meet  state  and  regional  energy  policy goals,  and  support  for  a  diverse  generation  mix,  including  renewable energy.  Xcel  Energy  owns  more  than  20,000  miles  of  transmission  lines, serving 22,000 MW of customer load.\n\nTransmission projects completed in 2020 include:\n\n| Project                        | Utility Subsidiary   |   Miles | Size   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------|--------|\n| Maple River-Red River          | NSP-Minnesota        |       4 | 115 KV |\n| Glenwood Douglas               | NSP-Minnesota        |      20 | 69 KV  |\n| Prentice to Structure          | NSP-Wisconsin        |       8 | 115 KV |\n| Lufkin to Naples               | NSP-Wisconsin        |      13 | 69 KV  |\n| Belgrade to Ironwood           | NSP-Wisconsin        |      13 | 35 KV  |\n| Cornucopia to Bayfield Phase 2 | NSP-Wisconsin        |       5 | 35 KV  |\n| Pawnee-Daniels Park            | PSCo                 |     113 | 345 KV |\n| Cheyenne Ridge                 | PSCo                 |      73 | 345 KV |\n| TUCO-Yoakum Co.                | SPS                  |     107 | 345 KV |\n| Eddy Co-Kiowa                  | SPS                  |      34 | 345 KV |\n| Mustang-Seminole               | SPS                  |      20 | 115 KV |\n| Loving South-Phantom           | SPS                  |      21 | 115 KV |\n\nNotable upcoming projects:\n\n| Project                        | Utility Subsidiary   |   Miles | Size   |   Completion Date |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------|--------|-------------------|\n| Hibbing Taconite  Relocation   | NSP-Minnesota        |       3 | 500 KV |              2021 |\n| Huntley-Wilmarth               | NSP-Minnesota        |      50 | 345 KV |              2021 |\n| Helena Scott County            | NSP-Minnesota        |      16 | 345 KV |              2021 |\n| Baytown to Long Lake           | NSP-Minnesota        |       9 | 115 KV |              2022 |\n| Centerville to Lincoln  County | NSP-Minnesota        |      14 | 69 KV  |              2021 |\n| Turtle Lake Almena             | NSP-Wisconsin        |       4 | 69 KV  |              2021 |\n| Bayfield Second Circuit        | NSP-Wisconsin        |      19 | 35 KV  |              2022 |\n| Roadrunner-China Draw          | SPS                  |      41 | 345 KV |              2021 |\n\nSee Item 2 - Properties for further information.\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistribution  lines  allow  electricity  to  travel  at  lower  voltages  from substations  directly  to  homes  and  businesses.  Xcel  Energy  has  a  vast distribution network, owning  and  operating  approximately  210,000 conductor miles of distribution lines across our eight-state service territory, both above ground and underground.\n\nTo continue providing reliable, affordable electric service and enable more flexibility for customers, we are working to digitize the distribution grid, while at the same time keeping it secure. Over the five year project, Xcel Energy plans  to  invest  approximately  $1.8  billion  implementing  new  network infrastructure,  smart  meters,  advanced  software,  equipment  sensors  and related data analytics capabilities.\n\nThese  investments  will  further  improve  reliability  and  reduce  outage restoration times for our customers, while at the same time enabling new options  and  opportunities  for  increased  efficiency  savings.  The  new capabilities  will  also  enable  integration  of  battery  storage  and  other distributed energy resources into the grid, including electric vehicles.\n\nSee Item 2 - Properties for further information.\n\n## Natural Gas Operations\n\nNatural  gas  operations  consist  of  purchase,  transportation  and  distribution  of  natural  gas  to  end-use  residential,  C&I  and  transport  customers  in  NSPMinnesota, NSP-Wisconsin and PSCo. Xcel Energy had natural gas deliveries of 444,340 (thousands of MMBtu), 2.1 million customers and natural gas revenues of $1,636 (millions of dollars) for 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the utility subsidiaries conduct natural gas price hedging activities approved by their states' commissions.\n\nAverage  delivered  cost  per  MMBtu  of  natural  gas  for  regulated  retail distribution:\n\n| Utility Subsidiary   |   2020 | 2019    |\n|----------------------|--------|---------|\n| NSP-Minnesota        |   3.32 | $  3.71 |\n| NSP-Wisconsin        |   3.08 | 3.49    |\n| PSCo                 |   2.52 | 2.95    |\n\nNSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo  have  natural  gas  supply transportation  and  storage  agreements  that  include  obligations  for purchase and/or delivery of specified volumes or to make payments in lieu of delivery.\n\n## General\n\n## General Economic Conditions\n\nEconomic  conditions  may  have  a  material  impact  on  Xcel  Energy's operating  results.  Other  events  impact  overall  economic  conditions  and management cannot predict the impact of fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. We could experience a material impact to our  results  of  operations,  future  growth  or  ability  to  raise  capital  resulting from  a  sustained  general  slowdown  in  economic  growth  or  a  significant increase in interest rates.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nDemand  for  electric  power  and  natural  gas  is  affected  by  seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result,  the  overall  operating  results  may  fluctuate  substantially  on  a seasonal  basis.  Additionally,  Xcel  Energy's  operations  have  historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.\n\n## Competition\n\nXcel  Energy  is  subject  to  public  policies  that  promote  competition  and development  of  energy  markets.  Xcel  Energy's  industrial  and  large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition,  customers  may  have  the  option  of  substituting  other  fuels  or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region.\n\nCustomers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and in most jurisdictions can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them.\n\nSeveral  states  have  incentives  for  the  development  of  rooftop  solar, community  solar  gardens  and  other  distributed  energy  resources. Distributed generating resources are potential competitors to Xcel Energy's electric service business with these incentives and federal tax subsidies.\n\nThe  FERC  has  continued  to  promote  competitive  wholesale  markets through  open  access  transmission  and  other  means.  Xcel  Energy's wholesale customers can purchase their output from generation resources of competing  suppliers  or  non-contracted  quantities  and  use  the transmission  systems  of  the  utility  subsidiaries  on  a  comparable  basis  to serve their native load.\n\nFERC  Order  No.  1000  established  competition  for  construction  and operation  of  certain  new  electric  transmission  facilities.  State  utility commissions have also created resource planning programs that promote competition  for  electric  generation  resources  used  to  provide  service  to retail customers.\n\nXcel Energy Inc.'s utility subsidiaries have franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal; however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization.\n\nWhile each utility subsidiary faces these challenges, Xcel Energy believes their rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available.\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nSee Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation.\n\n## Environmental\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nOur  facilities  are  regulated  by  federal  and  state  agencies  that  have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous substances. Certain Xcel Energy activities require registrations,  permits,  licenses,  inspections  and  approvals  from  these agencies.  Xcel  Energy  has  received  necessary  authorizations  for  the construction  and  continued  operation  of  its  generation,  transmission  and distribution  systems.  Our  facilities  operate  in  compliance  with  applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements.  However,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  when  or  to  what extent  additional  facilities  or  modifications  of  existing  or  planned  facilities will  be  required  as  a  result  of  changes  to  regulations,  interpretations  or enforcement  policies  or  what  effect  future  laws  or  regulations  may  have. We may be required to incur expenditures in the future for remediation of MGP and other sites if it is determined that prior compliance efforts are not sufficient.",

        "page_content": "Xcel  Energy  must  comply  with  emission  levels  in  Minnesota,  Texas  and Wisconsin  that  may  require  the  purchase  of  emission  allowances.  The Denver North Front Range Non-attainment Area does not meet either the 2008  or  2015  ozone  NAAQS.  Colorado  will  continue  to  consider  further reductions available in the non-attainment area as it develops plans to meet ozone standards. Gas plants which operate in PSCo's non-attainment area may  be  required  to  improve  or  add  controls,  implement  further  work practices and/or enhanced emissions monitoring as part of future Colorado state plans.\n\nThere are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs.\n\nIn  July  2019,  the  EPA  adopted  the  Affordable  Clean  Energy  rule,  which required  states  to  develop  plans  by  2022  for  GHG  reductions  from  coalfired power plants. In a Jan. 19, 2021 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the  D.C.  Circuit  issued  a  decision  vacating  and  remanding  the Affordable Clean Energy rule. That decision, if not successfully appealed or reconsidered, would allow the EPA to proceed with alternate regulation of coal-fired power plants, either reviving the Clean Power Plan or proposing additional  regulation.  It  is  too  early  to  predict  an  outcome,  but  new  rules could  require  substantial  additional  investment,  even  in  plants  slated  for retirement.  Xcel  Energy  believes,  based  on  prior  state  commission practices, the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates.\n\nIn October 2020, the TCEQ approved an agreement that ensures SPS will convert the Harrington plant from coal to natural gas by Jan. 1, 2025. This conversion  is  necessary  to  attain  Federal  Clean  Air  Act  standards  for emissions of SO2.\n\nXcel Energy seeks to address climate change and potential climate change regulation through efforts to reduce its GHG emissions in a balanced, costeffective manner.\n\nIn  2020,  Xcel  Energy  estimates  that  it  reduced  carbon  emissions associated  with  electric  generating  resources,  both  owned  and  under PPAs, used to serve its customers by approximately 51% from 2005 levels.\n\n## Environmental Costs\n\nEnvironmental  costs  include  amounts  for  nuclear  plant  decommissioning and  payments  for  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel,  disposal  of  hazardous materials  and  waste,  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  monitoring  of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to emissions.\n\nCosts charged to operating expenses for nuclear decommissioning, spent nuclear  fuel  disposal,  environmental  monitoring  and  remediation  and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 $400 million in 2020.\n- \u00b7 $345 million in 2019.\n- \u00b7 $335 million in 2018.\n\nAverage annual expense of approximately $465 million from 2021 - 2025 is estimated for similar costs. The  precise timing and  amount  of environmental  costs,  including  those  for  site  remediation  and  disposal  of hazardous  materials,  are  unknown.  Additionally,  the  extent  to  which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate.\n\nCapital expenditures for environmental improvements were approximately:\n\n- \u00b7 $30 million in 2020.\n- \u00b7 $30 million in 2019.\n- \u00b7 $50 million in 2018.\n\n## Capital Spending and Financing\n\nSee Item 7 for discussion of capital expenditures and funding sources.",

Risks  that  may  adversely  affect  the  business,  financial  condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. These risks should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC.\n\n## Oversight of Risk and Related Processes\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining  an  effective  risk  monitoring  process.  Management  and  the Board  of  Directors'  committees  have  responsibility  for  overseeing  the identification and mitigation of key risks and reporting its assessments and activities to the full Board of Directors.\n\nXcel  Energy  maintains  a  robust  compliance  program  and  promotes  a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process  includes  adherence  to  our  code  of  conduct  and  compliance policies,  operation  of  formal  risk  management  structures  and  overall business management. Xcel Energy further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal.\n\nManagement  identifies  and  analyzes  risks  to  determine  materiality  and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and  risk  analysis  occurs  formally  through  risk  assessment  conducted  by senior management,  the  financial  disclosure  process,  hazard  risk procedures,  internal  audit  and  compliance  with  financial  and  operational controls.\n\nManagement  also  identifies  and  analyzes  risk  through  the  business planning  process,  development  of  goals  and  establishment  of  key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing Xcel  Energy's  strategy.  The  business  planning  process  also  identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals.\n\nManagement communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates  a  periodic  risk  assessment  to  the  Board  of  Directors, providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including  financial  impact,  timing,  likelihood  and  mitigating  factors.  The Board of Directors regularly reviews management's key risk assessments, which  includes  areas  of  existing  and  future  macroeconomic,  financial, operational, policy, environmental and security risks.",

        "page_content": "The  oversight,  management  and  mitigation  of  risk  is  an  integral  and continuous part of the Board of Directors' governance of Xcel Energy. The Board  of  Directors  assigns  oversight  of  critical  risks  to  each  of  its  four committees  to  ensure  these  risks  are  well  understood  and  given appropriate focus.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  reviewing  the  adequacy  of  the committee's  risk  oversight  and  affirming  appropriate  aggregate  oversight occurs. Committees regularly report on their oversight activities and certain risk issues may be brought to the full Board of Directors for consideration when deemed appropriate.\n\nNew risks are considered and assigned as appropriate during the annual Board of Directors and committee evaluation process, resulting in updates to the committee charters and annual work plans.  Additionally, the Board of  Directors  conducts  an  annual  strategy  session  where  Xcel  Energy's future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\n\n## Risks Associated with Our Business\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nOur natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations involve  numerous  risks  that  may  result  in  accidents  and  other operating risks and costs.\n\nOur  natural  gas  transmission  and  distribution  activities  include  inherent hazards  and  operating  risks,  such  as  leaks,  explosions,  outages  and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and  outages.  These  risks  could  result  in  loss  of  life,  significant  property damage,  environmental  pollution,  impairment  of  our  operations  and substantial  financial  losses.  We  maintain  insurance  against  most,  but  not all,  of  these  risks  and  losses.  The  occurrence of these events, if not fully covered  by  insurance,  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOther  uncertainties  and  risks  inherent  in  operating  and  maintaining  Xcel Energy's facilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned.\n- \u00b7 Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies.\n- \u00b7 The  impact  of  unusual  or  adverse  weather  conditions  and  natural disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, icing events, floods and droughts.\n- \u00b7 Performance  below  expected  or  contracted  levels  of  output  or efficiency (e.g., performance guarantees).\n- \u00b7 Availability of replacement equipment.\n- \u00b7 Availability  of  adequate  water  resources  and  ability  to  satisfy  water intake and discharge requirements.\n- \u00b7 Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects.\n- \u00b7 Use of new or unproven technology.\n- \u00b7 Risks  associated  with  dependence  on  a  specific  type  of  fuel  or  fuel source,  such  as  commodity  price  risk,  availability  of  adequate  fuel supply  and  transportation  and  lack  of  available  alternative  fuel sources.\n- \u00b7 Increased  competition  due  to,  among  other  factors,  new  facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes.\n\nAdditionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  our  natural  gas  infrastructure  could result in significant costs. The PHMSA is responsible for administering the DOT's  national  regulatory  program  to  assure  the  safe  transportation  of natural  gas,  petroleum  and  other  hazardous  materials  by  pipelines.  The PHMSA  continues  to  develop  regulations  and  other  approaches  to  risk management  to  assure  safety  in  design,  construction,  testing,  operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant  incident  or  material  finding  of  non-compliance  could  result  in penalties and higher costs of operations.\n\nOur  natural  gas  and  electric  transmission  and  distribution  operations  are dependent  upon  complex  information  technology  systems  and  network infrastructure,  the  failure  of  which  could  disrupt  our  normal  business operations,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  ability  to process transactions and provide services.\n\n## Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to  long-term  planning  and  project risks.\n\nMost  electric  utility  investments  are  planned  to  be  used  for  decades. Transmission  and  generation  investments  typically  have  long  lead  times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. These  plans  are  based  on  numerous assumptions  such  as:  sales  growth,  customer  usage,  commodity  prices, economic  activity,  costs,  regulatory  mechanisms,  customer  behavior, available  technology  and  public  policy.  Xcel  Energy's  long-term  resource plan  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to  obtain  required  approvals,  develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines.\n\nIn  addition,  the  long-term  nature  of  both  our  planning  and  our  asset  lives are  subject  to  risk.  The  electric  utility  sector  is  undergoing  significant change (e.g.  increases  in  energy  efficiency,  wider  adoption  of  distributed generation  and  shifts  away  from  fossil  fuel  generation  to  renewable generation).  Customer  adoption  of  these  technologies  and  increased energy  efficiency  could  result  in  excess  transmission  and  generation resources,  downward  pressure  on  sales  growth,  and  potentially  stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments.\n\nChanging customer expectations and technologies are requiring significant investments  in  advanced  grid  infrastructure,  which  increases  exposure  to technology obsolescence. Additionally, evolving stakeholder preference for lower emissions from generation sources and end-uses, like heating, may put  pressure  on  our  ability  to  recover  capital  investments  in  natural  gas generation and delivery.\n\nThe magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning.  Efforts  to  electrify  the  transportation  and  building  sectors  to reduce  GHG  emissions  may  result  in  higher  electric  demand  and  lower natural gas demand over time. Additionally, multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which may lead to costs to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets.\n\nWe are  subject  to  longer-term  availability  of  inputs  such  as  coal,  natural gas,  uranium and water to cool our facilities.  Lack  of  availability  of  these resources  could  jeopardize  long-term  operations  of  our  facilities  or  make them uneconomic to operate.",

        "page_content": "## We are  subject  to  commodity  risks  and  other  risks  associated  with energy markets and energy production.\n\nIn the event fuel costs increase, customer demand could decline and bad debt expense may rise, which may have a material impact on our results of operations.  Despite  existing  fuel  recovery  mechanisms  in  most  of  our states, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered. Delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity.\n\nA significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs and supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which could cause disruptions in our ability to provide services to our customers. Failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in  fines,  penalties  or  cost  disallowances  through  the  regulatory  process. Also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\nWe  also  engage  in  wholesale  sales  and  purchases  of  electric  capacity, energy  and  energy-related  products  as  well  as  natural  gas.  In  many markets, emission allowances and/or RECs are also needed to comply with various  statutes  and  commission  rulings.  As  a  result,  we  are  subject  to market supply and commodity price risk.\n\nCommodity price  changes  can  affect  the  value  of  our  commodity  trading derivatives. We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily  basis.  Settlements  can  vary  significantly  from  estimated  fair  values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. The management of risks associated  with  hedging  and  trading  is  based,  in  part,  on  programs  and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing, Xcel Energy is unable to fully assure that its risk management programs and procedures would be effective to protect against all significant adverse market deviations. In addition, Xcel Energy cannot  fully  assure  that  its  controls  will  be  effective  against  all  potential risks,  including,  without  limitation,  employee  misconduct.  If  such  controls are not effective, Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially impacted.\n\n## Failure  to  attract  and  retain  a  qualified  workforce  could  have  an adverse effect on operations.\n\nSpecialized  knowledge  is  required  of  our  technical  employees  for construction  and  operation  of  transmission,  generation  and  distribution assets.  Xcel  Energy's  business  strategy  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to recruit,  retain  and  motivate  employees.  There  is  competition  and  a tightening market for skilled employees. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement  employees,  including  the  transfer  of  significant  internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. Inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work.\n\nWe rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction  work.  Our  contractual  arrangements  with  these  contractors typically  include  performance  standards,  progress  payments,  insurance requirements and security for performance. Poor vendor performance could impact ongoing operations, restoration operations, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines.\n\n## Our  subsidiary,  NSP-Minnesota,  is  subject  to  the  risks  of  nuclear generation.\n\nNSP-Minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, PI and Monticello. Risks of nuclear generation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Hazards  associated  with  the  use  of  radioactive  material  in  energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal.\n- \u00b7 Limitations  on  insurance  available  to  cover  losses  that  may  arise  in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to  an  insurance  pool  in  the  event  of  damages  at  a  covered  U.S. reactor.\n- \u00b7 Technological  and  financial  uncertainties  related  to  the  costs  of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change.\n\nThe NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for  the  operation  of  nuclear  generation  facilities,  including  the  ability  to impose fines  and/or  shut  down  a  unit  until  compliance  is  achieved.  NRC safety  requirements  could  necessitate  substantial  capital  expenditures  or an  increase  in  operating  expenses.  In  addition,  the  INPO  reviews  NSPMinnesota's nuclear operations. Compliance with the INPO's recommendations  could  result  in  substantial  capital  expenditures  or  a substantial increase in operating expenses.\n\nIf a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows.  Furthermore,  noncompliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could  result  in  increased  industry  regulation,  which  may  increase  NSPMinnesota's compliance costs.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n## Our  profitability  depends  on  the  ability  of  our  utility  subsidiaries  to recover their costs and changes in regulation may impair the ability of our utility subsidiaries to recover costs from their customers.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  comprehensive  regulation  by  federal  and  state  utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers.\n\nThe  profitability  of  our  utility  operations  is  dependent  on  our  ability  to recover  the  costs  of  providing  energy  and  utility  services  and  earning  a return  on  capital  investment.  Our  rates  are  generally  regulated  and  are based on an analysis of the utility's costs incurred in a test year. The utility subsidiaries are subject to both future and historical test years depending upon the regulatory jurisdiction. Thus, the rates a utility is allowed to charge may  or  may  not  match  its  costs  at  any  given  time.  Rate  regulation  is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.\n\nThere can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all  the  costs of our utility subsidiaries to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery.\n\nOverall,  management  believes  prudently  incurred  costs  are  recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. However, there may be changes in the  regulatory  environment  that  could  impair  the  ability  of  our  utility subsidiaries to recover costs historically collected from customers, or these subsidiaries could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery.",

        "page_content": "Changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of  our  assets  may  result  in  early  retirements  of  utility  facilities.  While regulation typically provides cost recovery relief for these types of changes, there  is  no  assurance  that  regulators  would  allow  full  recovery  of  all remaining costs.\n\nIn  a  continued  low  interest  rate  environment,  there  has  been  increased downward  pressure  on  allowed  ROE.  Conversely,  higher  than  expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. Also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that our utility subsidiaries will not be able to fully recover their fuel costs from their customers.\n\nAdverse regulatory rulings or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and materially affect our  ability  to  meet  our  financial  obligations,  including  debt  payments  and the payment of dividends on common stock.\n\n## Any  reductions  in  our  credit  ratings  could  increase  our  financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\n\nWe cannot be assured that our current credit  ratings  or  our  subsidiaries' ratings will remain in effect, or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. Significant events including disallowance of costs, lower returns on equity, changes to equity ratios and impacts of tax policy may impact our cash flows and credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the  differing  methodologies  or  change  in  the  methodologies  used  by  the various rating agencies.\n\nAny  credit  ratings  downgrade  could  lead  to  higher  borrowing  costs  and could  impact  our  ability  to  access  capital  markets.  Also,  our  utility subsidiaries  may  enter  into  contracts  that  require  posting  of  collateral  or settlement if credit ratings fall below investment grade.\n\n## We are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.\n\nUtility  operations  require  significant  capital  investment.  As  a  result,  we frequently need to access capital markets. Any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations.  Capital market  disruption  and  financial  market  distress  could  prevent  us  from issuing short-term commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue  securities  with  unfavorable  terms  and  conditions,  such  as  higher interest rates. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe  performance  of  capital  markets  impacts  the  value  of  assets  held  in trusts  to  satisfy  future  obligations  to  decommission  NSP-Minnesota's nuclear plants and satisfy our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit    plan  obligations.  These  assets  are  subject  to  market  fluctuations and  yield  uncertain  returns,  which  may  fall  below  expected  returns.  A decline  in  the  market  value  of  these  assets  may  increase  funding requirements. Additionally, the fair value of the debt securities held in the nuclear  decommissioning  and/or  pension  trusts  may  be  impacted  by changes in interest rates.\n\n## We are subject to credit risks.\n\nCredit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the economy and unemployment rates. Credit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become  insolvent  and  may  breach  their  obligations.  Should  the counterparties  fail  to  perform,  we  may  be  forced  to  enter  into  alternative arrangements.  In  that  event,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely affected and incur losses.\n\nXcel Energy may have direct credit exposure in our short-term wholesale and commodity trading activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. We may  also  have  some  indirect  credit  exposure  due  to  participation  in organized  markets,  (e.g.  California  Independent  System  Operator,  SPP, PJM Interconnection, LLC, MISO and Electric Reliability Council of Texas), in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants. We have additional  indirect  credit  exposure  to  financial  institutions  from  letters  of credit  provided  as  security  by  power  suppliers  under  various  purchased power contracts.  If  any  of  the  credit  ratings  of  the  letter  of  credit  issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that  security  with  an  acceptable  substitute.  If  the  security  were  not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract.\n\n## Increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits  may  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations,  financial condition or cash flows.\n\nWe have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our  employees.  Assumptions  related  to  future  costs,  return  on investments,  interest  rates  and  other  actuarial  assumptions  have  a significant  impact  on  our  funding  requirements  of  these  plans.  Estimates and assumptions may change. In addition, the Pension Protection Act sets the  minimum  funding  requirements  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans. Therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future. Also, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year, due to high numbers of retirements or employees leaving, would  trigger  settlement  accounting  and  could  require  Xcel  Energy  to recognize  incremental  pension  expense  related  to  unrecognized  plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. Changes in industry standards utilized in  key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs.\n\n## Increasing  costs  associated  with  health  care  plans  may  adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIncreasing levels  of  large  individual  health  care  claims  and  overall  health care  claims  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  our  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows.    Health  care  legislation  could  also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs.\n\n## We  must  rely  on  cash  from  our  subsidiaries  to  make  dividend payments.\n\nInvestments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all of our  operations  are  conducted  by  our  subsidiaries.  Consequently,  our operating  cash  flow  and  ability  to  service  our  debt  and  pay  dividends depends  upon  the  operating  cash  flows  of  our  subsidiaries  and  their payment of dividends.\n\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any  amounts  due  pursuant  to  our  obligations  or  to  make  any  funds available for dividends on our common stock. In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay dividends depends on statutory and/or contractual restrictions which  may  include  requirements  to  maintain  minimum  levels  of  equity ratios, working capital or assets.\n\nIf  the  utility  subsidiaries  were  to  cease  making  dividend  payments,  our ability  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock  or  otherwise  meet  our financial obligations could be adversely affected. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated  by  state  utility  commissions,  which  possess  broad  powers  to ensure  that  the  needs  of  the  utility  customers  are  met.  We  may  be negatively  impacted  by  the  actions  of  state  commissions  that  limit  the payment of dividends by our utility subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "## Federal tax law may significantly impact our business.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  collect  estimated  federal,  state  and  local  tax payments  through  their  regulated  rates.  Changes  to  federal  tax  law  may benefit  or  adversely  affect  our  earnings  and  customer  costs.  Tax depreciable lives and the value of various tax credits or the timeliness of their utilization may impact the economics or selection of resources. If tax rates  are  increased,  there  could  be  timing  delays  before  regulated  rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. In addition, certain IRS  tax  policies,  such  as  tax  normalization,  may  impact  our  ability  to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices.\n\n## Macroeconomic Risks\n\n## Economic conditions impact our business.\n\nXcel  Energy's  operations  are  affected  by  local,  national  and  worldwide economic conditions, which correlates to customers/sales growth (decline). Economic  conditions  may  be  impacted  by  insufficient  financial  sector liquidity  leading  to  potential  increased  unemployment,  which  may  impact customers' ability to pay their bills, which could lead to additional bad debt expense.\n\nOur  utility  subsidiaries  face  competitive  factors,  which  could  have  an adverse impact on our financial condition , results  of  operations  and  cash flows. Further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. There  may  be  delays  before  these  additional  material  costs  can  be recovered in rates.\n\n## We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may  have  a  material  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe  global  outbreak  of  COVID-19  is  impacting  countries,  communities, supply chains and markets. A high degree of uncertainty continues to exist regarding  the  pandemic,  the  duration  and  magnitude  of  business restrictions,  re-shut  downs,  if  any,  and  the  level  and  pace  of  economic recovery.  While  we  are  implementing  contingency  plans,  there  are  no guarantees these plans will be sufficient to offset the impact of COVID-19.\n\nAlthough  the  impact  of  the  pandemic  to  the  2020  results  was  largely mitigated  due  to  management's  actions,  we  cannot  ultimately  predict whether  it  will  have  a  material  impact  on  our  future  liquidity,  financial condition or results of operations. Nor can we predict the impact of the virus on the health of our employees, our supply chain or our ability to recover higher costs associated with managing through the pandemic. The impact of  COVID-19  may  exacerbate  other  risks  discussed  herein,  which  could have  a  material  effect  on  us.  The  situation  is  evolving  and  additional impacts may arise.\n\n## Operations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events.\n\nOur generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities  and  information  and  control  systems  may  be  targets  of  terrorist activities. Any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues  and  additional  costs  to  repair  and  insure  our  assets.  These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business. We have already incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. In addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\n\nA disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources,  could  negatively  impact  our business,  brand  and  reputation.  Because  our  facilities  are  part  of  an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility.\n\nWe also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such as severe storms, severe temperature extremes, wildfires (particularly in  Colorado),  widespread  pandemic,  generator  or  transmission  facility outage,  pipeline  rupture,  railroad  disruption,  operator  error,  sudden  and significant  increase  or  decrease  in  wind  generation  or  a  workforce disruption.\n\nIn addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. Xcel Energy participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. A prolonged disruption could result in the delay of equipment and materials that may impact our ability to reliably serve our customers.\n\nA major disruption could result in  a  significant  decrease  in  revenues  and additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nXcel  Energy  participates  in  grid  security  and  emergency  response exercises  (GridEx).  These  efforts,  led  by  the  NERC,  test  and  further develop  the  coordination,  threat  sharing  and  interaction  between  utilities and various government agencies relative to potential cyber and physical threats against the nation's electric grid.\n\n## A  cyber  incident  or  security  breach  could  have  a  material  effect  on our business.\n\nWe  operate  in  an  industry  that  requires  the  continued  operation  of sophisticated information technology, control systems  and  network infrastructure. In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect,  use,  disclose,  store,  dispose  of  and  otherwise  process  sensitive information,  including  company  data,  customer  energy  usage  data,  and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, shareholders and other individuals.\n\nXcel  Energy's  generation,  transmission,  distribution  and  fuel  storage facilities,  information  technology  systems  and  other  infrastructure  or physical  assets,  as  well  as  information  processed  in  our  systems  (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error. The utility industry has been the target of several attacks  on  operational  systems  and  has  seen  an  increased  volume  and sophistication  of  cyber  security  incidents  from  international  activist organizations, Nation States and individuals.\n\nCyber  security  incidents  could  harm  our  businesses  by  limiting  our generating, transmitting and distributing capabilities, delaying our development  and  construction  of  new  facilities  or  capital  improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability.",

        "page_content": "Xcel Energy's generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cyber security incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural  gas  pipeline  infrastructure  or  other  fuel  sources  of  our  third-party service providers' operations, could also negatively impact our business.\n\nOur  supply  chain  for  procurement  of  digital  equipment  and  services  may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant  costs  of  remediation.  We  are  unable  to  quantify  the  potential impact  of  cyber  security  threats  or  subsequent  related  actions.  Cyber security incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in  revenues  and  may  cause significant  additional  costs  (e.g.,  penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels.\n\nWe maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control  systems,  network  infrastructure  and  other  assets.  However,  these assets  and  the  information  they  process  may  be  vulnerable  to  cyber security incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information.\n\nA  failure  or  breach  of  our  technology  systems  or  those  of  our  third-party service  providers  could  disrupt  critical  business  functions  and  may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. The cyber security  threat  is  dynamic  and  evolves  continually,  and  our  efforts  to prioritize  network  protection  may  not  be  effective  given  the  constant changes to threat vulnerability.\n\n## Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather.\n\nOur electric  and  natural  gas  utility  businesses  are  seasonal  and  weather patterns  can  have  a  material  impact  on  our  operating  performance. Demand for electricity  is  often  greater  in  the  summer  and  winter  months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather  patterns.  A  significant  amount  of  natural  gas  revenues  are recognized  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  related  to  the  heating  season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer.  Unusually  mild  winters  and  summers  could  have  an  adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Public Policy Risks\n\n## We may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nLegislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial  risk  as  our  facilities  may  be  subject  to  additional  regulation  at either the state or federal level in the future. International agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations.\n\nIn  2015,  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change reached  consensus  among  190  nations  on  an  agreement  (the  Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2\u00ba Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase  to  1.5\u00ba  Celsius.  The  Biden  Administration  will  establish  a  new nationally  determined  contribution  for  the  United  States.  The  Paris Agreement could result in future additional GHG reductions in the United States.  In  addition,  the  Biden  Administration  has  announced  plans  to implement new climate change programs, including potential regulation of GHG emissions targeting the utility industry.\n\nThe Biden Administration  has  also  announced  a  one  year  suspension  of new oil and natural gas drilling on federal lands to allow for a review of oil and gas leasing regulations. The form of these regulations is uncertain, but, depending on the requirements imposed in the short and long term, they could  impose  substantial  costs  on  our  oil  and  gas  customers  or  result  in substantial increases to the cost of fuel we use in our electricity and gas businesses.\n\nMany  states  and  localities  continue  to  pursue  their  own  climate  policies. The  steps  Xcel  Energy  has  taken  to  date  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, including  energy  efficiency  measures,  adding  renewable  generation  or retiring  or  converting  coal  plants  to  natural  gas,  occurred  under  stateendorsed  resource  plans,  renewable  energy  standards  and  other  state policies.\n\nWe may be subject to climate change lawsuits. An adverse outcome could require  substantial  capital  expenditures  and  possibly  require  payment  of substantial  penalties  or  damages.  Defense  costs  associated  with  such litigation  can  also  be  significant  and  could  affect  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows  if  such  costs  are  not  recovered  through regulated rates.\n\nIf our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or cash flows.\n\n## Increased  risks  of  regulatory  penalties  could  negatively  impact  our business.\n\nThe  Energy  Act  increased  civil  penalty  authority  for  violation  of  FERC statutes, rules and orders. The FERC can impose penalties of up to $1.3 million  per  violation  per  day,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  energy  trading activities  for  both  electricity  and  natural  gas.  In  addition,  NERC  electric reliability  standards  and  critical  infrastructure  protection  requirements  are mandatory and subject to potential  financial  penalties.  Also,  the  PHMSA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to assess penalties.\n\nIn the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. In addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. If a  serious  reliability,  cyber  or  safety  incident  did  occur,  it  could  have  a material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash flows.\n\n## Environmental Risks\n\n## We  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  with  which compliance could be difficult and costly.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  that  affect  many aspects  of  our  operations,  including  air  emissions,  water  quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes  and  hazardous  substances.  Laws  and  regulations  require  us  to obtain  permits,  licenses,  and  approvals  and  to  comply  with  a  variety  of environmental requirements.\n\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to loweremitting  facilities,  install  pollution  control  equipment,  clean  up  spills  and other  contamination  and  correct  environmental  hazards.  Failure  to  meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where  our  past  activities,  or  the  activities  of  other  parties,  caused environmental contamination.",

        "page_content": "Changes in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. While regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  mandates  to  provide  customers  with  clean  energy, renewable  energy  and  energy  conservation  offerings.  It  could  have  a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or O&M costs incurred to comply with the requirements.\n\nIn addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new  laws  or  regulations  may  be  adopted.  We  may  also  incur  additional unanticipated  obligations  or  liabilities  under  existing  environmental  laws and regulations.\n\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change  and  other  weather,  natural  disaster  and  resource  depletion impacts.\n\nClimate  change  can  create  physical  and  financial  risk.  Physical  risks include  changes  in  weather  conditions  and  extreme  weather  events.  Our customers'  energy  needs  vary  with  weather.  To  the  extent  weather conditions  are  affected  by  climate  change,  customers'  energy  use  could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require  us  to  invest  in  generating  assets,  transmission  and  infrastructure. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues.\n\nClimate  change  may  impact  the  economy,  which  could  impact  our  sales and revenues. The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation  of  GHG,  could  impact  the  availability  of  goods  and  prices charged  by  our  suppliers  which  would  normally  be  borne  by  consumers through  higher  prices  for  energy  and  purchased  goods.  To  the  extent financial  markets  view  climate  change  and  emissions  of  GHGs  as  a financial  risk,  this  could  negatively  affect  our  ability  to  access  capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\n\nSevere weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow or ice storms occur. Extreme  weather  conditions  in  general  require  system  backup  and  can contribute  to  increased  system  stress,  including  service  interruptions. Extreme  weather  conditions  creating  high  energy  demand  may  raise electricity  prices,  increasing  the  cost  of  energy  we  provide  to  our customers.\n\nTo  the  extent  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events  increases,  this could  increase  our  cost  of  providing  service.  Periods  of  extreme temperatures  could  impact  our  ability  to  meet  demand.  Changes  in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations. Drought conditions also contribute to the increase in wildfire risk from our electric generation facilities.\n\nWhile we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if Xcel Energy was  found  to  be  liable  for  wildfire  damages,  amounts  that  potentially exceed  our  coverage  could  negatively  impact  our  results  of  operations, financial  condition  or  cash  flows.

The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable  estimation.Management  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an amount  or  range  of  a  reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding  the  timing  or  ultimate  resolution  of  such  matters,  including  a possible eventual loss.\n\nFor current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on Xcel Energy's financial statements.

        "page_content": "## ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe  following  discussion  includes  financial  information  prepared  in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such  as  ongoing  ROE,  electric  margin,  natural  gas  margin,  ongoing earnings  and  ongoing  diluted  EPS.  Generally,  a  non-GAAP  financial measure  is  a  measure  of  a  company's  financial  performance,  financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  uses  non-GAAP  measures  for  financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining  performance-based  compensation,  and  communicating  its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are  intended  to  supplement  investors'  understanding  of  our  performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in  accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled nonGAAP financial measures.\n\n## Ongoing ROE\n\nOngoing  ROE  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's  average  stockholder's  equity.  We  use  these  non-GAAP  financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.\n\n## Electric and Natural Gas Margins\n\nElectric  margin  is  presented  as  electric  revenues  less  electric  fuel  and purchased  power  expenses.  Natural  gas  margin  is  presented  as  natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power and the cost of natural gas are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As  a  result,  changes  in  these  expenses  are  generally  offset  in  operating revenues. Management believes electric and natural gas margins provide the  most  meaningful  basis  for  evaluating  our  operations  because  they exclude the revenue impact of fluctuations in these expenses.\n\nThese margins can be reconciled to operating income, a GAAP measure, by including other operating revenues, cost of sales-other, O&M expenses, conservation and DSM expenses, depreciation and amortization and taxes (other than income taxes).\n\n## Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\n\nGAAP  diluted  EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents)  were  settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.'s diluted EPS is  calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method.  Ongoing  earnings  reflect adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  (net  income)  for  certain  items.  Ongoing diluted  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  income  or  loss  of  each subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel  Energy  Inc.  common  shares  outstanding  for  the  period.  Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\n\nWe  use  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  evaluate  and  provide details  of  Xcel  Energy's  core  earnings  and  underlying  performance.  We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and  projected  financial  performance  and  contribution  of  our  subsidiaries. For  the  years  ended  Dec.  31,  2020  and  2019,  there  were  no  such adjustments  to  GAAP  earnings  and  therefore  GAAP  earnings  equal ongoing earnings.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nDiluted EPS for Xcel Energy at Dec. 31:\n\n| Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share              | 2020 GAAP and  Ongoing Diluted  EPS   | 2019 GAAP and  Ongoing Diluted  EPS   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| NSP-Minnesota                                  | $  1.12                               | $  1.04                               |\n| PSCo                                           | 1.11                                  | 1.11                                  |\n| SPS                                            | 0.56                                  | 0.51                                  |\n| NSP-Wisconsin                                  | 0.20                                  | 0.15                                  |\n| Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries | 0.05                                  | 0.05                                  |\n| Regulated utility  (a)                         | 3.04                                  | 2.86                                  |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. and Other                     | (0.25)                                | (0.22)                                |\n| Total  (a)                                     | $  2.79                               | $  2.64                               |\n\nXcel  Energy's  management  believes  that  ongoing  earnings  reflects management's  performance  in  operating  Xcel  Energy  and  provides  a meaningful  representation  of  the  performance  of  Xcel  Energy's  core business.  In  addition,  Xcel  Energy's  management  uses  ongoing  earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.\n\n## 2020 Comparison with 2019\n\nXcel Energy - GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.15 per share, primarily  reflecting  higher  electric  margin  (largely  due  to  regulatory outcomes  which  recover  capital  investment),  higher  AFUDC  and  lower O&M expenses, which offset increased depreciation, interest expense and declining sales primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nNSP-Minnesota - Earnings increased $0.08 per share for 2020, reflecting higher electric margin (riders, wholesale transmission revenue and a sales true-up  mechanism,  which  recovers  lower  sales  due  to  COVID-19)  and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation and lower natural gas margin.\n\nPSCo -  Earnings  were  flat  for  2020,  reflecting  higher  electric  margin (wholesale  transmission  revenue  and  regulatory  outcomes  offset  lower sales due to COVID-19), increased AFUDC and higher natural gas margin, offset by additional depreciation and taxes (other than income taxes).\n\nSPS -  Earnings  increased  $0.05  per  share  for  2020,  reflecting  higher electric margin (wholesale transmission revenue and regulatory outcomes offset  lower  sales  due  to  COVID-19)  and  lower  O&M  expenses,  partially offset  by  increased  depreciation,  interest  expense  and  taxes  (other  than income taxes).\n\nNSP-Wisconsin - Earnings increased $0.05 per share for 2020, reflecting higher  electric  margin  (regulatory  outcomes  offset  lower  sales  due  to COVID-19)  and  lower  O&M  expenses,  partially  offset  by  increased depreciation and lower natural gas margin.\n\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other -  Primarily  includes  financing  costs  at  the holding company.",

The estimated  impact  of  weather  on  earnings  is  based  on  the  number  of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related  operating  expenses  that  could  result  due  to  storm  activity  or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance to the extent there is not a decoupling or sales true-up mechanism in the state.\n\nDegree-day or THI data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain  comfortable  indoor  temperature  levels  based  on  each  day's average temperature and humidity. HDD is the measure of the variation in the  weather  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the  average  daily  temperature falls  below  65\u00b0  Fahrenheit.  CDD  is  the  measure  of  the  variation  in  the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is  counted  as  one  CDD,  and  each  degree  of  temperature  below  65\u00b0 Fahrenheit is counted as one HDD. In Xcel Energy's more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD.  HDD,  CDD  and  THI  are  most  likely  to  impact  the  usage  of  Xcel Energy's  residential  and  commercial  customers.  Industrial  customers  are less sensitive to weather.\n\nNormal  weather  conditions  are  defined  as  either  the  10,  20  or  30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory  practice.  To  calculate  the  impact  of  weather  on  demand,  a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations,  windchill  and  cloud  cover  may  not  be  reflected  in  weathernormalized estimates.\n\nPercentage (decrease) increase in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI:\n\n|     | 2020 vs. Normal   | 2019 vs. Normal   | 2020 vs. 2019   |\n|-----|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| HDD | (3.1) %           | 10.4 %            | (12.0) %        |\n| CDD | 22.2              | 5.4               | 24.8            |\n| THI | 6.3               | (8.8)             | 18.2            |\n\nWeather - Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:\n\n|                                               | 2020 vs. Normal   | 2019 vs. Normal   | 2020 vs.  2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Retail electric                               | $  0.090          | $  0.040          | $  0.050         |\n| Decoupling and sales true-up                  | (0.041)           | -                 | (0.041)          |\n| Total (excluding decoupling)                  | $  0.049          | $  0.040          | $  0.009         |\n| Firm natural gas                              | (0.011)           | 0.027             | (0.038)          |\n| Total (adjusted for recovery from decoupling) | $  0.038          | $  0.067          | $  (0.029)       |\n\nSales - Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales:\n\n|                              | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                              | PSCo            | NSP- Minnesota  | SPS             | NSP- Wisconsin  | Xcel  Energy    |\n| Actual  (a)                  |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Electric  residential        | 5.8 %           | 5.0 %           | 3.6 %           | 2.4 %           | 4.9 %           |\n| Electric C&I                 | (4.1)           | (7.0)           | (3.3)           | (4.6)           | (5.0)           |\n| Total retail  electric sales | (1.1)           | (3.4)           | (2.2)           | (2.6)           | (2.3)           |\n| Firm natural gas  sales      | (6.8)           | (8.3)           | n/a             | (6.4)           | (7.2)           |\n\n|                              | 2020 vs. 2019           | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   | 2020 vs. 2019   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                              | PSCo                    | NSP- Minnesota  | SPS             | NSP- Wisconsin  | Xcel  Energy    |\n| Weather-normalized  (a)      | Weather-normalized  (a) |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Electric  residential        | 3.8 %                   | 3.7 %           | 1.6 %           | 2.6 %           | 3.3 %           |\n| Electric C&I                 | (4.5)                   | (7.0)           | (3.4)           | (4.8)           | (5.2)           |\n| Total retail  electric sales | (1.9)                   | (3.8)           | (2.6)           | (2.7)           | (2.8)           |\n| Firm natural gas  sales      | 0.5                     | 1.9             | n/a             | 5.1             | 1.3             |",

However, these fluctuations  have  minimal  impact  on  margin  due  to  fuel  recovery mechanisms.  In  addition,  electric  customers  receive  a  credit  for  PTCs generated, which reduce electric revenue and margin (offset by lower tax expense).\n\n## Electric revenues and margin:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | 2020     | 2019     |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Electric revenues                 | $  9,802 | $  9,575 |\n| Electric fuel and purchased power | (3,512)  | (3,510)  |\n| Electric margin                   | $  6,290 | $  6,065 |\n\n## Changes in Electric Margin\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                      | 2020 vs. 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Regulatory rate outcomes (Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas  and New Mexico)  (a) | $  209          |\n| Non-fuel riders                                                            | 74              |\n| Wholesale transmission revenue (net)                                       | 59              |\n| MEC purchased capacity costs                                               | 35              |\n| Conservation incentive                                                     | 13              |\n| 2019 tax reform customer credits - Wisconsin (offset in income tax)        | 7               |\n| Estimated impact of weather (net of decoupling / sales true-up)            | 7               |\n| PTCs flowed back to customers (offset by lower ETR)                        | (119)           |\n| Sales and demand  (b)                                                      | (66)            |\n| Other (net)                                                                | 6               |\n| Total increase in electric margin                                          | $  225          |\n\n## Natural Gas Margin\n\nNatural  gas  expense  varies  with  changing  sales  and  cost  of  natural  gas.

The increase was primarily driven by the Hale, Cheyenne Ridge, Foxtail, Blazing Star I, Lake Benton, Sagamore,  Crowned  Ridge,  Community  Wind  North  and  Jeffers  wind facilities  going  into  service,  as  well  as  normal  system  expansion.  In addition,  new  depreciation  rates  were  implemented  in  Colorado,  New Mexico and Texas in 2020, increasing expense.\n\nTaxes  (Other  than  Income  Taxes) -Taxes  (other  than  income  taxes) increased  $43  million,  or  7.6%,  year-to-date.  The  increase  was  primarily due  to  higher  property  taxes  in  Colorado  and  Texas  (net  of  deferred amounts).\n\nOther  Income  (Expense) -Other  income  (expense)  decreased  $22 million  year-to-date. The decrease was largely due to the performance of rabbi trust investments, primarily offset in O&M expenses.\n\nAFUDC, Equity and Debt - AFUDC increased $43 million year-to-date. The increase was primarily due to various wind projects under construction.\n\nInterest Charges -Interest charges increased $67 million, or 8.7%, yearto-date. The increase was largely due to higher debt levels to fund capital investments,  partially  offset  by  lower  long-term  and  short-term  interest rates.\n\nIncome  Taxes -Income  taxes  decreased  $134  million  for  2020.  The decrease  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  wind  PTCs  and  an increase in plant-related regulatory differences.\n\n## Xcel Energy Inc. and Other Results\n\nNet  income  and  diluted  EPS  contributions  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its nonregulated businesses:\n\n|                                          | Contribution (Millions of Dollars)   | Contribution (Millions of Dollars)   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2020                                 | 2019                                 |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (147)                             | $  (128)                             |\n| MEC  (a)                                 | 15                                   | -                                    |\n| Eloigne  (b)                             | 1                                    | 1                                    |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | (2)                                  | 12                                   |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (133)                             | $  (115)                             |\n\n|                                          | Contribution (Diluted Earnings  (Loss) Per Share)   | Contribution (Diluted Earnings  (Loss) Per Share)   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2020                                                | 2019                                                |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs         | $  (0.28)                                           | $  (0.21)                                           |\n| MEC  (a)                                 | 0.03                                                | -                                                   |\n| Eloigne  (b)                             | -                                                   | -                                                   |\n| Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results | -                                                   | (0.01)                                              |\n| Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs   | $  (0.25)                                           | $  (0.22)                                           |\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  results  include  interest  charges,  which  are  incurred  at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries.\n\n## 2019 Comparison with 2018\n\nA discussion of changes in Xcel Energy's results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended Dec. 31, 2018 to Dec. 31, 2019 can be found in Part II, 'Item 7, Management's Discussion and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations'  of  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2019, which was filed with the SEC on Feb. 21, 2020. However, such discussion is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Public Utility Regulation\n\nThe  FERC  and  various  state  and  local  regulatory  commissions  regulate Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility  subsidiaries  and  WGI.  Xcel  Energy  is  subject  to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.\n\nRates  are  designed  to  recover  plant  investment,  operating  costs  and  an allowed  return  on  investment.  Our  utility  subsidiaries  request  changes  in rates  for  utility  services  through  filings  with  governing  commissions. Changes  in  operating  costs  can  affect  Xcel  Energy's  financial  results, depending  on  the  timing  of  rate  case  filings  and  implementation  of  final rates.  Other  factors  affecting  rate  filings  are  new  investments,  sales, conservation and DSM efforts, and the cost of capital.\n\nIn addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energy's results of operations.\n\nSee Rate Matters within Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.",

        "page_content": "## Additional Information:\n\n2020  Minnesota  Electric  Rate  Case  and  Stay-Out  Alternative  In November 2020, NSP-Minnesota filed an electric rate case seeking a $597 million revenue increase over three years with the MPUC. The rate case is based  on  a  requested  ROE  of  10.2%  and  a  52.5%  equity  ratio.  NSPMinnesota also filed a stay-out alternative in which it would withdraw its rate case filing.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  MPUC  verbally  approved  the  stay-out  alternative petition, which includes the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms and delays any increase to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust annual accrual until Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nAdditionally,  NSP-Minnesota  agreed  to  not  seek  recovery  of  incremental COVID-19 related expenses, including bad debt expense, and committed to fund  $18  million  in  a  Residential  Payment  Plan  Credit  Program  or  other similar customer relief programs, as directed by the MPUC. NSP-Minnesota also  agreed  to  an  earnings  test  in  which  all  earnings  above  an  ROE  of 9.06% in 2021 would be refunded to customers.\n\n2020  North  Dakota  Electric  Rate  Case  In  November  2020,  NSPMinnesota filed a request with the NDPSC for an overall increase in annual retail  electric  revenues  of  approximately  $22  million,  or  an  increase  of 10.8%. The rate filing is based on a 2021 forecast test year, a requested ROE  of  10.2%,  an  equity  ratio  of  52.50%  and  an  electric  rate  base  of approximately $677 million. Interim rates, subject to refund, of approximately $16 million were implemented on Jan. 5, 2021.\n\n2020 TCR Electric Rider  In  November  2019,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the TCR Rider based on an ROE of 9.06%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2020 GUIC Natural Gas Rider In November 2019, NSP-Minnesota filed the GUIC Rider based on an ROE of 9.04%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2021 GUIC Natural Gas Rider In October 2020, NSP-Minnesota filed the GUIC Rider based on an ROE of 9.04%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2020 RES Electric Rider  In  November  2019,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the RES Rider. The requested amount includes a true-up for the 2019 rider of $38  million  and  the  2020  requested  amount  of  $64  million.  The  filing included an ROE of 9.06%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\n2021 RES Electric Rider  In  November  2020,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  the RES  Rider.  The  requested  amount  includes  a  true-up  for  the  2019  and 2020 rider  of  $96  million  and  the  2021  requested  amount  of  $93  million. The filing included an ROE of 9.06%. An MPUC decision is pending.\n\nMinnesota  Resource  Plan -In  July  2019,  NSP-Minnesota  filed  its Minnesota resource plan, which runs through 2034. The plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 (from 2005) and puts NSP-Minnesota on a path to achieving its vision of being 100% carbon-free by 2050.\n\nThe updated preferred resource plan reflects the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Retirement of all coal generation by 2030 with reduced operations at some units  prior  to  retirement,  including  early  retirement  of  the  A.S. King coal plant (511 MW) in 2028 and the Sherco 3 coal plant (517 MW) in 2030.\n- \u00b7 Extending the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040.\n- \u00b7 Continuing to run the PI through current end of life (2033 and 2034).\n- \u00b7 Construction of the Sherco combined cycle natural gas plant.\n- \u00b7 The addition of 3,500 MW of solar.\n- \u00b7 The addition of 2,250 MW of wind.\n- \u00b7 2,600 MW of firm peaking (combustion turbine, pumped hydro, battery storage, demand response, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Achieving  780  GWh  in  energy  efficiency  savings  annually  through 2034.\n- \u00b7 Adding 400 MW of incremental demand response by 2023, and a total of 1,500 MW of demand response by 2034.\n\nInitial  comments  were  submitted  Feb.  11,  2021  and  reply  comments  are due  April  12,  2021.  The  MPUC  is  anticipated  to  make  a  final  decision during 2021.\n\nMinnesota Relief and Recovery -In 2020, the MPUC opened a docket and invited utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump start the economy to offset the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nNSP-Minnesota's proposal included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Repower 651 MW of owned wind projects (capital investment of $750 million) as well as certain wind projects under PPAs.\n- \u00b7 Acquire 120 MW repowered wind farm and buy-out of the remaining PPA from ALLETE for $210 million.\n- \u00b7 Add solar facilities of 460 MW with an incremental investment of $550 million.\n- \u00b7 Accelerate certain grid investment.\n- \u00b7 Provide $150 million of incremental electric vehicle rebates.\n\nIn December 2020, the MPUC verbally approved the repowering of owned wind projects and 20 MW of wind projects under PPAs. These projects are estimated to save customers approximately $160 million over the next 25 years. The MPUC is expected to address the solar facilities, ALLETE PPA wind repowering acquisition and the electric vehicle proposal in the second half of 2021.\n\n## Purchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Provider\n\nNSP-Minnesota expects to use power plants, power purchases, CIP/DSM options, new generation facilities and expansion of power plants to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - NSP-Minnesota has contracts to purchase power from other  utilities and  IPPs.  Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity and an energy charge.\n\nNSP-Minnesota makes short-term purchases to meet system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased Transmission Services - NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.",

        "page_content": "Minnesota  State  ROFR  Statute  Complaint -  In  September  2017,  LSP Transmission filed a complaint in the Minnesota District Court against the Minnesota  Attorney  General,  MPUC  and  DOC.  The  complaint  was  in response  to  MISO  assigning  NSP-Minnesota  and  ITC  Midwest,  LLC  to jointly  own  a  new  345  KV transmission line from Mankato to Winnebago, Minnesota. The project is estimated to cost approximately $120 million and projected  to  be  in-service  by  the  end  of  2021.  It  was  assigned  to  NSPMinnesota  and  ITC  Midwest  as  the  incumbent  utilities,  consistent  with  a Minnesota state ROFR statute.\n\nThe complaint challenged the constitutionality of the statute and is seeking declaratory judgment that the statute violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and should not be enforced. In June 2018, the Minnesota District  Court  granted  Minnesota  state  agencies  and  NSP-Minnesota's motions  to  dismiss  with  prejudice.  In  February  2020,  the  Eighth  Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Minnesota District Court decision to dismiss. In June  2020,  the  Eighth  Circuit  denied  LSP  Transmission's  petition  for rehearing.  In  November  2020,  LSP  Transmission  petitioned  the  U.S. Supreme  Court  to  review  its  appeal.  NSP-Minnesota  filed  a  brief  in opposition to this petition on Jan. 25, 2021.\n\n## Nuclear Power Operations\n\nNuclear  power  plant  operations  produce  gaseous,  liquid  and  solid radioactive  wastes,  which  are  covered  by  federal  regulation.  High-level radioactive  wastes  primarily  include  used  nuclear  fuel.  Low-level  waste consists primarily of demineralizer resins, paper, protective clothing, rags, tools and equipment contaminated through use.\n\nNRC  Regulation -  The  NRC  regulates  nuclear  operations.  Costs  of complying with NRC requirements can affect both operating expenses and capital investments of the plants. NSP-Minnesota has obtained recovery of these compliance costs and expects to recover future compliance costs.\n\nLow-Level Waste Disposal - Low level waste disposal from Monticello and PI is  disposed at the Clive facility located in Utah and the Waste Control Specialists facility in Texas. NSP-Minnesota has storage capacity available on-site  at  PI  and  Monticello  which  would  allow  both  plants  to  continue  to operate until the end of their current licensed lives if off-site low-level waste disposal facilities become unavailable.\n\nHigh-Level  Radioactive  Waste  Disposal -  The  federal  government  has responsibility to permanently dispose domestic spent nuclear fuel and other high-level  radioactive  wastes.  The  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act  requires  the DOE to  implement  a  program  for  nuclear  high-level  waste  management. This  includes  the  siting,  licensing,  construction  and  operation  of  a repository  for  spent  nuclear  fuel  from  civilian  nuclear  power  reactors  and other  high-level  radioactive  wastes  at  a  permanent  federal  storage  or disposal  facility.  Currently,  there  are  no  definitive  plans  for  a  permanent federal storage facility site.\n\nNuclear Spent Fuel Storage - NSP-Minnesota has interim on-site storage for  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  its  Monticello  and  PI  nuclear  generating  plants. Authorized storage capacity is sufficient to allow NSP-Minnesota to operate until  the  end  of  the  operating  licenses  in  2030  for  Monticello,  2033  for  PI Unit  1,  and  2034  for  PI  Unit  2.  Authorizations  for  additional  spent  fuel storage capacity may be required at each site to support either continued operation  or  decommissioning  if  the  federal  government  does  not commence storage operations.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nNSP-Minnesota  conducts  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy-related  products.

Once  the  PSCW approves the plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel  cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a 2% annual  tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a  fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of  deferred  costs  is  determined  by  the  PSCW.  Rate  recovery  of  deferred  fuel  cost  is  subject  to  an  earnings  test  based  on  the  most  recently  authorized  ROE.  Under-collections  that  exceed  the 2% annual tolerance band may not be recovered if the utility  earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE.

Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  for dispatchable resources typically require a capacity charge and an energy charge.  NSP-Minnesota  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet  system requirements, replace company owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased Transmission Services - NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin have contracts with MISO and other regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to their customers.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nNSP-Wisconsin does not serve any wholesale requirements customers at cost-based regulated rates.\n\n## PSCo\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO   | Additional Information on Regulatory Authority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CPUC                    | Retail rates, accounts, services, issuance of securities and other  aspects of electric, natural gas and steam operations.

This increase reflects a $94 million increase in base rate revenue, partially offset by $17 million of costs previously recovered through the Pipeline Integrity rider. Rates will be implemented on April 1, 2021 (retroactive to November 2020).\n\n2019 Electric Rate Case - In 2019, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC seeking  a  net  rate  increase  of  approximately  $108  million.  In  February 2020,  the  CPUC  issued  an  initial  decision  for  a  net  rate  increase  of  $35 million.  In  July  2020,  the  CPUC's  final  written  decision  on  rehearing  was received and resulted in an additional increase of approximately $12 million annually.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  CPUC  denied  PSCo's  request  of  a  $5  million surcharge for changes to the revenue increase from the effective date of rates,  based  on  the  CPUC's  decision  on  rehearing.  PSCo  has  appealed this decision with the District Court of Denver County.",

        "page_content": "2019 Phase I Electric Rate Case Appeal - In August 2020, PSCo filed an appeal with the Denver District Court seeking a review of CPUC decisions on gain on sales and losses of assets, oil and gas royalty revenues and Board of Director's equity compensation. PSCo plans to seek consolidation of  this  appeal  with  the  appeal  of  the  surcharge  decision  in  this  same proceeding.\n\n2019 Natural Gas Rate Case Appeal - In April 2019, PSCo filed an appeal seeking judicial review of the CPUC's prior ruling regarding PSCo's natural gas rate case (filed in June 2017 and approved in December 2018). The appeal requested review of the following: denial of a return on the prepaid pension and retiree medical assets; the use of a capital structure not based on  the  actual  historical  test  year;  and  use  of  an  average  rate  base methodology rather than a year-end rate base methodology.\n\nIn  March  2020,  The  District  Court  of  Denver  County  ruled  in  favor  of allowing the prepaid pension assets to be included in rate base; but upheld the  CPUC's  treatment  of  the  retiree  medical  assets  and  capital  structure methodology. In March 2021, PSCo expects to file a motion to implement the District Court's decision on treatment of the prepaid pension asset for the applicable period of Jan. 1, 2018 through Oct. 31, 2020.\n\nWildfire Protection Rider -In 2020, PSCo requested to establish a rider to recover  incremental  costs  associated  with  system  investments  to  reduce wildfire risk. The rider would be effective in June 2021 and continue through 2025. The Office of Consumer Counsel and CPUC Staff are supportive of the wildfire mitigation program as proposed, but oppose rider recovery and instead recommend deferral of certain costs with recovery in a future rate case. A CPUC decision is expected in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nWildfire Protection capital investment is projected to be approximately $325 million. Forecasted annual revenue requirements from 2021 through 2025:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                  | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Forecasted annual revenue  requirement | $  17  | $  24  | $  29  | $  32  | $  34  |\n\nTransportation Electrification Plan -In January 2021, the CPUC approved PSCo's Transportation Electrification Plan, which authorizes rider recovery of new electric vehicle utility programs for the residential, commercial, multifamily and public charging sectors. The approval establishes utility-owned charging infrastructure and chargers and amortization of rebates for electric vehicles.  The  Transportation  Electrification  Plan  approval  authorizes approximately $110 million in spending with flexibility up to approximately $138 million over three years.\n\n## Advanced Grid Rider\n\nIn 2020, PSCo requested to establish a rider to recover incremental costs associated with the Advanced Grid Intelligence and Security initiative. The rider would be effective in May 2021 and continue through 2025. In October 2020,  an  ALJ  issued  The  Recommended  Decision  granting  the  Office  of Consumer Counsel motion to dismiss the Advanced Grid Rider. PSCo has chosen not to appeal the ALJ's Recommended Decision.\n\nThe PSCo portion of the Advanced Grid Intelligence and Security capital investment  is  projected  to  be  approximately  $850  million.  Forecasted annual revenue requirements from 2021 through 2025 are as follows:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                  | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Forecasted annual revenue  requirement | $  53  | $  69  | $  83  | $  89  | $  99  |\n\n## PSCo KEPCO Filing\n\nIn September 2020, PSCo filed with the CPUC for approval to terminate a solar PPA with KEPCO Solar of Alamosa, Inc. and establish a regulatory asset  to  recover  transaction  costs  of  approximately  $41  million.  By terminating the PPA, customers would save approximately $38 million over an 11-year period. A CPUC decision is expected in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n## Natural Gas LDC and Emission Reductions\n\nIn October 2020, the CPUC opened a docket to investigate topics related to natural gas emissions in relation to statewide emission reduction goals. The first meeting was held in November 2020, in which subject matter experts discussed greenhouse emission reductions required from the natural gas industry in regard to the statewide goals.\n\n## Resource Plan\n\nPSCo is expected to file its next Electric Resource Plan on March 31, 2021. The filing will propose the future of the remaining coal plants in Colorado and PSCo's plan to achieve it's 80% carbon emissions reduction target by 2030. A CPUC decision is expected in 2022.\n\n## PSCo - Comanche Unit 3\n\nPSCo is part owner and operator of Comanche Unit 3, a 750 MW, coalfueled  electric  generating  unit.  In  January  2020,  the  unit  experienced  a turbine failure  causing the unit to be taken offline for repairs, which were completed  in  June  2020.  During  start-up  the  unit  experienced  a  loss  of turbine  oil,  which  damaged  the  plant.  Comanche  Unit  3  recommenced operations in January 2021. Replacement and repair of damaged systems in excess of a $2 million deductible are expected to be recovered through insurance policies. PSCo  obtained replacement power costs of approximately $16 million during the outage. In October 2020, the CPUC initiated  a  non-adjudicatory  review  of  Comanche  Unit  3's  performance.  A report  on  performance  is  expected  to  be  issued  in  March  2021.  At  this stage  of  the  regulatory  review,  the  resulting  recommendations  of  the CPUC's staff cannot be determined.\n\n## Boulder Municipalization\n\nIn 2011, Boulder passed a ballot measure authorizing the formation of an electric  municipal  utility.  Subsequently,  there  have  been  various  legal proceedings in multiple venues.\n\nIn  September  2020,  the  City  Council  voted  to  approve  a  settlement between PSCo and Boulder officials to end the city's municipalization effort. The settlement resulted in a 20-year franchise arrangement (with multiple opt-out  conditions),  an  energy  partnership  and  an  undergrounding agreement.  It  also  established  the  municipalization  process  if  Boulder exercised  an  opt-out.  In  December  2020,  PSCo  filed  the  franchise agreement with the CPUC and is currently awaiting a decision.\n\n## Purchased Power and Transmission Service Providers\n\nPSCo expects  to  meet  its  system  capacity  requirements  through  electric generating  stations,  power  purchases,  new  generation  facilities,  DSM options and expansion of generation plants.\n\nPurchased Power - PSCo purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term purchased power contracts for dispatchable resources typically require capacity and energy charges. It also contracts to purchase power for  both  wind  and  solar  resources.  PSCo  makes  short-term  purchases  to meet  system  load  and  energy  requirements,  replace  owned  generation, meet operating reserve obligations, or obtain energy at a lower cost.",

The Western Energy Imbalance Market allows participants to buy and sell power close to the  time  electricity  is  consumed  and  gives  system  operators  real-time visibility  across  neighboring  grids.  The  result  improves  balancing  supply and demand at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  In  addition  to  using  its  own transmission  system,  PSCo  has  contracts  with  regional  transmission service providers to deliver energy to its customers.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nPSCo  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy related products. PSCo uses physical and financial instruments to minimize commodity price and credit risk and hedge sales and purchases. PSCo also engages in trading activity unrelated to hedging. Sharing of any margin is determined through state regulatory proceedings as well as the operation of the FERC approved JOA.\n\n## SPS\n\n## Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction\n\n| Regulatory Body / RTO                | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PUCT                                 | Retail  electric  operations,  rates,  services,  construction  of  transmission  or  generation  and  other  aspects  of  SPS'  electric  operations.

New rates and tariffs were effective in May 2020.\n\n2019 Texas Electric Rate Case - In August 2020, the PUCT approved a settlement  between  SPS  and  intervening  parties,  which  reflects  the following terms: a rate increase of $88 million; ROE of 9.45% and equity ratio  of  54.62%  for  AFUDC  purposes.  In  December  2020,  SPS  filed  to surcharge the final under-recovered amount, estimated to be approximately $72 million, offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs.\n\n2021  New  Mexico  Electric  Rate  Case  -  On  Jan.  4,  2021,  SPS  filed  an electric  rate  case  with  the  NMPRC  seeking  an  increase  in  base  rates  of approximately $88 million. SPS' net rate increase to New Mexico customers is expected to be approximately $48 million, or 10%, as a result of offsetting fuel cost reductions and PTCs attributable to wind energy provided by the Sagamore wind project. PTCs are being credited to customers through the fuel clause.\n\nThe request is based on a historic test year ended Sept. 30, 2020, including expected  capital  additions  through  Feb.  28,  2021,  a  ROE  of  10.35%,  an equity  ratio  of  54.72%  and  retail  rate  base  of  approximately  $1.9  billion (total company rate base of approximately $6.0 billion).\n\nAdditionally,  the  request  includes  the  effect  of  approximately  400  MW  of reduced  peak  load  in  2021  from  a  wholesale  transmission  customer  and changes to depreciation rates to reflect a reduction to the service lives of SPS' Tolk power plant (from 2037 to 2032) and the coal handling assets at the Harrington facility (to 2024).\n\nThe  NMPRC  suspended  new  rates  for  nine  months  beyond  the  30-day notice period, consistent with historic practice.\n\nThe next steps in the procedural schedule are expected to be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Staff and intervenor testimony - May 17, 2021.\n- \u00b7 Rebuttal testimony - June 9, 2021.\n- \u00b7 Deadline to file stipulation - June 23, 2021.\n- \u00b7 Public hearing or hearing on stipulation - July 26 - Aug. 6, 2021.\n- \u00b7 End of nine month suspension - Nov. 3, 2021.\n\nA NMPRC decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n2021 Texas Rate Case - On Feb. 8, 2021, SPS filed an electric rate case with  the  PUCT  and  its  81  municipalities  with  original  rate  jurisdiction seeking an increase in base rates of approximately $143 million. SPS' net rate  increase  to  Texas  customers  is  expected  to  be  approximately  $74 million, or 9.2%, as a result of offsetting $69 million in fuel cost reductions and PTCs from the Sagamore wind project.",

Once final rates are approved, a surcharge will be requested from March  15,  2021  through  the  effective  date  of  new  base  rates.  A  PUCT decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nTexas State ROFR Litigation In May 2019, the Governor signed a ROFR bill into law, which grants incumbent utilities a ROFR to build transmission infrastructure when it directly interconnects to the utility's existing facility. In June 2019, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western  District of Texas  claiming the new  ROFR  law  to  be unconstitutional.  In  February  2020,  the  federal  court  complaint  was dismissed by the district court. In March 2020, the district court ruling was appealed to the Fifth Circuit. A decision is pending.\n\nNew  Mexico  FPPCAC  Continuation  In  December  2020,  the  Hearing Examiner  recommended  the  NMPRC  approve  SPS'  request  for  the continued use of the FPPCAC and the reconciliation of its fuel costs for the reporting  period  (September  2015  through  June  2019).  Additionally,  the Hearing  Examiner  recommended the NMPRC deny the proposed Annual Deferred  Fuel  Balance  True-Up.  The  proposed  true-up  is  designed  to maintain  the  Deferred  Fuel  and  Purchased  Power  balance  within  a bandwidth of plus or minus 5% of annual New Mexico fuel and purchased power costs. A decision is pending.\n\nResource Plan SPS is required to file an IRP in New Mexico every three years and will file its next IRP in July 2021.\n\n## Purchased Power Arrangements and Transmission Service Providers\n\nSPS expects  to  use  electric  generating  stations,  power  purchases,  DSM and new generation options to meet its system capacity requirements.\n\nPurchased Power - SPS purchases power from other utilities and IPPs. Long-term  purchased  power  contracts  typically  require  periodic  capacity and  energy  charges.  SPS  also  makes  short-term  purchases  to  meet system load and energy requirements to replace owned generation, meet operating reserve obligations or obtain energy at a lower cost.\n\nPurchased  Transmission  Services -  SPS  has  contractual  arrangements with SPP and regional transmission service providers to deliver power and energy to its native load customers.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSPS  does  not  provide  retail  natural  gas  service,  but  purchases  and transports natural gas for its generation facilities and operates natural gas pipeline  facilities  connecting  the  generation  facilities  to  interstate  natural gas pipelines. SPS is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to natural gas transactions in interstate commerce and the PHMSA and PUCT for pipeline safety compliance.\n\n## Wholesale and Commodity Marketing Operations\n\nSPS  conducts  various  wholesale  marketing  operations,  including  the purchase  and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  ancillary  services  and energy  related  products.  SPS  uses  physical  and  financial  instruments  to minimize  commodity  price  and  credit  risk  and  to  hedge  sales  and purchases.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the application  of  accounting  rules  and  guidance,  as  well  as  the  use  of estimates. Application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could  materially  impact  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  based  on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  operation  of  the  business  and results reported.\n\nAccounting policies and estimates that are most significant to Xcel Energy's results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows,  and  require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are outlined below.  Each  of  these  has  a  higher  likelihood  of  resulting  in  materially different  reported  amounts  under  different  conditions  or  using  different assumptions.  Each  critical  accounting  policy  has  been  reviewed  and discussed  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  Board  of Directors on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nXcel Energy is subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations , which provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates  will  be  charged  and  collected.  Our  rates  are  derived  through  the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities  based  on  the  probability  of  future  cash  flows.  Regulatory  assets generally  represent  incurred  or  accrued  costs  that  have  been  deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or other comprehensive income.",

Decisions  made  by  regulatory agencies can directly impact the amount and timing of cost recovery as well as  the  rate  of  return  on  invested  capital,  and  may  materially  impact  our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, Xcel Energy had regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and regulatory liabilities of $5.6 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. Each  subsidiary  is  subject  to  regulation  that  varies  from  jurisdiction  to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs in any such jurisdiction is no longer probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or other comprehensive income. At Dec. 31, 2020, in assessing the  probability  of  recovery  of  recognized  regulatory  assets,  Xcel  Energy noted  no  current  or  anticipated  proposals  or  changes  in  the  regulatory environment that it expects will materially impact the probability of recovery of the assets.\n\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Income Tax Accruals\n\nJudgment, uncertainty and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax  accrual  process  that  accounts  for  the  effects  of  current  and  deferred income  taxes.  Uncertainty  associated  with  the  application  of  tax  statutes and  regulations  and  outcomes  of  tax  audits  and  appeals  require  that judgment  and  estimates  be  made  in  the  accrual  process  and  in  the calculation of the ETR.\n\nChanges in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities  and  our  future  ETR.  ETR  calculations  are  revised  every  quarter based on best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  interim  period  reporting  guidance,  income  tax expense for  the  first  three  quarters  in  a  year  is  based  on  the  forecasted annual ETR. The forecasted ETR reflects a number of estimates, including forecasted annual income, permanent tax adjustments and tax credits.\n\nValuation allowances are applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that at least a portion may not be realized based on an evaluation of  expected  future  taxable  income.  Accounting  for  income  taxes  also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. We may adjust our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  and  interest  accruals  as  disputes  with  the IRS  and  state  tax  authorities  are  resolved,  and  as  new  developments occur. These adjustments may increase or decrease earnings.\n\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\nWe  sponsor  several  noncontributory,  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and other  postretirement  benefit  plans  that  cover  almost  all  employees  and certain retirees. Projected benefit costs are based on historical information and actuarial calculations that include key assumptions (annual return level on  pension  and  postretirement  health  care  investment  assets,  discount rates, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates, etc.). In addition, the pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  methodology  to  reduce  the  volatility  of investment  performance  over  time.  Pension  assumptions  are  continually reviewed.\n\nAt  Dec.  31,  2020,  Xcel  Energy  set  the  rate  of  return  on  assets  used  to measure  pension  costs  at  6.49%,  which  represents  a  38  basis  point decrease  from  the  rate  set  in  2019.  The  rate  of  return  used  to  measure postretirement  health  care  costs  is  4.10%  at  Dec.  31,  2020,  which represents a 40 basis point decrease from 2019.\n\nXcel  Energy's  pension  investment  strategy  is  based  on  plan-specific investments  that  seek  to  minimize  investment  and  interest  rate  risk  as  a plan's funded status increases over time. This strategy results in a greater percentage of interest rate sensitive securities being allocated to plans with a  higher  funded  status  and  a  greater  percentage  of  growth  assets  being allocated to plans having a lower funded status ratios.\n\nXcel Energy set the discount rates used to value the pension obligations at 2.71%  and  postretirement  health  care  obligations  at  2.65%  at  Dec.  31, 2020.  This  represents  a  78  basis  point  and  82  basis  point  decrease, respectively,  from  2019.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  bond  matching  study  as  its primary basis for determining the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement health care obligations. The bond matching study utilizes a portfolio of high grade (Aa or higher) bonds that matches the expected cash flows of Xcel Energy's benefit plans in amount and duration.\n\nThe effective yield on this cash flow matched bond portfolio determines the discount rate for the individual plans. The bond matching study is validated for reasonableness against the Merrill Lynch Corporate 15+ Bond Index. In addition, Xcel Energy reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected.\n\nIf  Xcel  Energy  were  to  use  alternative  assumptions,  a  1%  change  would result in the following impact on 2020 pension costs:\n\n|                       | Pension Costs   | Pension Costs   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | +1%             | -1%             |\n| Rate of return        | (16)            | $               |\n| Discount rate  (a)    | (5)             | $               |\n\nMortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience for pension plan and postretirement benefits. Xcel Energy's actuary conducts an experience study periodically to determine an estimate of mortality. Xcel Energy  considers  standard  mortality  tables,  improvement  factors  and  the plans actual experience when selecting a best estimate.\n\nAs of  Dec.  31,  2020,  the  initial  medical  trend  cost  claim  assumptions  for Pre-65  was  5.5%  and  Post-65  was  5.0%.  The  ultimate  trend  assumption remained at 4.5% for both Pre-65 and Post-65 claims costs. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long-term cost inflation expected in the health care  market,  considering  the  levels  projected  and recommended by industry experts,  as  well  as  recent  actual  medical  cost experienced by Xcel Energy's retiree medical plan.\n\nFunding  contributions  in  2021  were  $125  million  and  are  expected  to decline in the following years. Investment returns exceeded assumed levels in 2020 and 2019 and were below assumed levels in 2018.",

        "page_content": "The  pension  cost  calculation  uses  a  market-related  valuation  of  pension assets.  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  calculated  value  method  to  determine  the market-related  value  of  the  plan  assets.  The  market-related  value  is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the  actual  investment  return  and  the  expected  investment  return  on  the market-related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20%  per  year.  As  differences  between  actual  and  expected  investment returns  are  incorporated  into  the  market-related  value,  amounts  are recognized in pension cost over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees (approximately 13 years in 2020).\n\nXcel  Energy  currently  projects  the  pension  costs  recognized  for  financial reporting  purposes  will  be  $106  million  in  2021  and  $83  million  in  2022, while the actual pension costs were $117 million in 2020 and $115 million in 2019. The expected decrease in 2021 and future year costs is primarily due to the reductions in loss amortizations.\n\nPension  funding  contributions  across  all  four  of  Xcel  Energy's  pension plans, both voluntary and required, for 2018 - 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 $125 million in January 2021.\n- \u00b7 $150 million in 2020.\n- \u00b7 $154 million in 2019.\n- \u00b7 $150 million in 2018.\n\nFuture  amounts  may  change  based  on  actual  market  performance, changes  in  interest  rates  and  any  changes  in  governmental  regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future.\n\nXcel  Energy  contributed  $11  million,  $15  million  and  $11  million  during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $10 million during 2021. Xcel  Energy  recovers  employee  benefits  costs  in  its  utility  operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below.\n\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota  recognizes  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions  using  the  aggregate  normal  cost  actuarial  method. Differences  between  aggregate  normal  cost  and  expense  as calculated  by  pension  accounting  standards  are  deferred  as  a regulatory liability.\n- \u00b7 In  2018,  the  PSCW  approved  NSP-Wisconsin's  request  for  deferred accounting  treatment  of  the  2018  pension  settlement  accounting expense.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory Commissions in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions  allow  the  recovery  of  other  postretirement  benefit  costs only  to  the  extent  that  recognized  expense  is  matched  by  cash contributions  to  an  irrevocable  trust.    Xcel  Energy  has  consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions.\n- \u00b7 PSCo  and  SPS  recognize  pension  expense  in  all  regulatory jurisdictions based on GAAP. The Texas and Colorado electric retail jurisdictions  and  the  Colorado  gas  retail  jurisdiction,  each  record  the difference  between  annual  recognized  pension  expense  and  the annual amount of pension expense approved in their last respective general rate case as a deferral to a regulatory asset.\n- \u00b7 In  2018,  PSCo  was  required  to  create  a  regulatory  liability  to  adjust postretirement health care costs to zero in order to match the amounts collected in rates in the Colorado Gas retail jurisdiction. In 2020, this requirement was extended to the Colorado Electric retail jurisdiction.\n\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning\n\nXcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived  assets  for  which  a  legal  obligation  exists.  These  AROs  are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of  the  related  long-lived  assets.  In  the  absence  of  quoted  market  prices, Xcel  Energy  estimates  the  fair  value  of  its  AROs  using  present  value techniques,  in  which  it  makes  assumptions  including  estimates  of  the amounts  and  timing  of  future  cash  flows  associated  with  retirement activities,  credit-adjusted  risk  free  rates  and  cost  escalation  rates.  When Xcel  Energy  revises  any  assumptions,  it  adjusts  the  carrying  amount  of both  the  ARO  liability  and  related  long-lived  asset.  ARO  liabilities  are accreted to reflect the passage of time using the interest method.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  Xcel  Energy's  AROs  relates  to  the  future decommissioning  of  NSP-Minnesota's  nuclear  facilities.  The  nuclear decommissioning  obligation  is  funded  by  the  external  decommissioning trust  fund.  Difference  between  regulatory  funding  (including  depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and expense recognized is deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $2.0 billion in 2020 and $2.1 billion in 2019.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  obtains  periodic  independent  cost  studies  in  order  to estimate the cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. Estimates  of  future  cash  flows  are  highly  uncertain  and  may  vary significantly from actual results. NSP-Minnesota is required to file a nuclear decommissioning filing every three years. The filing covers all expenses for the decommissioning of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material.\n\nThe annual accrual (funding/recovery) set for 2019 and 2020 was based on the 2014 nuclear decommissioning filing, approved in 2015. Although the MPUC  approved  an  increased  accrual  from  the  2017  triennial  filing  in January  2019,  the  MPUC  subsequently  ordered  Xcel  Energy  to  maintain the accrual level (previously established via the 2014 filing) through 2020.\n\nIn  December  2020,  Xcel  Energy  submitted  a  2020  triennial  nuclear decommissioning  filing  to  the  MPUC.  The  filing  resulted  in  an  updated annual accrual of $33 million, or an increase of $19 million compared to the currently  approved  funding  level.  In  December  2020,  the  MPUC  verbally approved NSP-Minnesota to continue using the 2014 filing as the basis for 2021. The filing was also used to revise the estimated ARO liability as of Dec. 31, 2020 ($216 million decrease).\n\nThe  following  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  estimated nuclear obligation:\n\nTiming - Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facility's retirement  date  and  timing  of  the  actual  decommissioning  activities. Estimated  retirement  dates  coincide  with  the  expiration  of  each  unit's operating  license  with  the  NRC  (i.e.,  2030  for  Monticello  and  2033  and 2034  for  PI's  Unit  1  and  2,  respectively).  The  estimated  timing  of  the decommissioning activities is based upon the DECON method (required by the MPUC),  which  assumes  prompt  removal  and  dismantlement. Decommissioning activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2095.\n\nTechnology  and  Regulation -  There  is  limited  experience  with  actual decommissioning  of  large  nuclear  facilities.  Changes  in  technology, experience  and  regulations  could  cause  cost  estimates  to  change significantly.",

    {
        "page_content": "Escalation  Rates -  Escalation  rates  represent  projected  cost  increases due  to  general  inflation  and  increases  in  the  cost  of  decommissioning activities. NSP-Minnesota applied escalation rates of 3.1% for PI and 3.2% for Monticello in calculating the nuclear decommissioning AROs, based on weighted averages of labor and non-labor escalation factors calculated by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nDiscount Rates - Changes in timing or estimated cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then-current creditadjusted  risk-free  interest  rate.  The  credit-adjusted  risk-free  rate  in  effect when the  change  occurs  is  used  to  discount  the  revised  estimate  of  the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity.\n\nIf  the  change  in  timing  or  estimated  expected  cash  flows  results  in  a downward  revision  of  the  ARO,  the  undiscounted  revised  estimate  of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect  at  the  date  of  initial  measurement  and  recognition  of  the  original ARO. Discount rates ranging from approximately 3% to 7% have been used to  calculate  the  net  present  value  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows  over time.\n\nSignificant  uncertainties  exist  in  estimating  future  costs  including  the method to be utilized, ultimate costs to decommission and planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially.\n\nHowever,  changes  in  estimates  have  minimal  impact  on  results  of operations  as  NSP-Minnesota  expects  to  continue  to  recover  all  costs  in future rates.\n\nXcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to  recorded  results  to  better  reflect  updated  information  that  becomes available.  The  accompanying  financial  statements  reflect  management's best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nSee Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks  in  the  normal  course  of business.  Market  risk  is  the  potential  loss  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of adverse changes in the market or fair  value  of  a  particular  instrument  or commodity.  All  financial  and  commodity-related  instruments,  including derivatives, are subject to market risk.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  exposed  to  the  impact  of  adverse  changes  in  price  for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its  derivatives  and  other  contracts,  including  parental  guarantees  and requests of collateral. While we expect that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives,  the  contracts  expose  us  to some credit and non-performance risk.\n\nDistress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk, the fair value of the securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and pension fund and Xcel Energy's ability to earn a return on short-term investments.\n\nCommodity Price Risk -We are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric  and  natural  gas  operations.  Commodity  price  risk  is  managed  by entering into long- and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric  capacity,  energy  and  energy-related  products  and  fuels  used  in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading  Risk -Xcel  Energy  conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and  sale  of  electric  capacity,  energy,  energy-related  instruments  and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Our risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee.\n\nFair  value  of  net  commodity  trading  contracts  as  of  Dec.  31,  2020:\n\n|                       | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   | Futures / Forwards Maturity   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | Less  Than 1 Year             | 1 to 3  Years                 | 4 to 5  Years                 | Greater  Than 5 Years         | Total  Fair Value             |\n| NSP-Minnesota  (a)    | $  (2)                        | $  1                          | $  2                          | $  2                          | $  3                          |\n| NSP-Minnesota  (b)    | (3)                           | 3                             | (7)                           | (6)                           | (13)                          |\n| PSCo  (a)             | -                             | 1                             | -                             | -                             | 1                             |\n| PSCo  (b)             | (25)                          | (39)                          | (13)                          | -                             | (77)                          |\n|                       | $  (30)                       | $  (34)                       | $  (18)                       | $  (4)                        | $  (86)                       |\n\n|                       | Options Maturity Greater   | Options Maturity Greater   | Options Maturity Greater   | Options Maturity Greater   | Options Maturity Greater   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars) | Less  Than 1 Year          | 1 to 3  Years              | 4 to 5  Years              | Than 5 Years               | Total Fair  Value          |\n| NSP-Minnesota  (b)    | $  1                       | $  -                       | $  -                       | $  1                       | $  2                       |\n| PSCo  (b)             | 13                         | 16                         | 1                          | -                          | 30                         |\n|                       | $  14                      | $  16                      | $  1                       | $  1                       | $  32                      |\n\nChanges in the fair value of commodity trading contracts before the impacts of margin-sharing for the years ended Dec. 31:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fair value of commodity trading net contracts outstanding at Jan. 1  | $  (59) | $  17   |\n| Contracts realized or settled during the period                      | (9)     | (22)    |\n| Commodity trading contract additions and changes during the period   | 14      | (54)    |\n| Fair value of commodity trading net contracts outstanding at Dec. 31 | $  (54) | $  (59) |\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2020, a 10% increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts  through  the  forward  curve  would  increase  pretax  income  from continuing  operations  by  approximately  $13  million,  whereas  a  10% decrease  would  decrease  pretax  income  from  continuing  operations  by approximately  $13  million.  At  Dec.  31,  2019,  a  10%  increase  in  market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing  operations  by  approximately  $10  million,  whereas  a  10% decrease  would  decrease  pretax  income  from  continuing  operations  by approximately $10 million.

Long-term,  through  2030,  NSP-Minnesota  is scheduled  to  take  delivery  of  approximately  28%  of  its  average  enriched nuclear material requirements from these sources. NSP-Minnesota is able to  manage  nuclear  fuel  supply  with  alternate  potential  sources.  NSPMinnesota periodically assesses if further actions are required to assure a secure supply of enriched nuclear material.\n\nInterest Rate Risk - Xcel Energy is subject to interest rate risk. Our risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of  fixed  rate  debt,  floating  rate  debt  and  interest  rate  derivatives  such  as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options.\n\nA 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energy's variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by approximately $6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nNSP-Minnesota maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. The fund is invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments. These investments may be used only for the purpose of decommissioning NSPMinnesota's nuclear generating plants.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains on the decommissioning fund investments are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning  costs.  Fluctuations  in  equity  prices  or  interest  rates affecting the nuclear decommissioning fund do not have a direct impact on earnings due to the application of regulatory accounting.\n\nChanges in discount rates and expected return on plan assets impact the value of pension and postretirement plan assets and/or benefit costs.\n\nCredit Risk -Xcel Energy is also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  counterparties'  nonperformance  on  their contractual  obligations.  Xcel  Energy  maintains  credit  policies  intended  to minimize  overall  credit  risk  and  actively  monitor  these  policies  to  reflect changes and scope of operations.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2020, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $11 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an immaterial increase in credit exposure. At Dec. 31, 2019, a 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $19 million, while a decrease in prices of 10% would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $14 million.\n\nXcel  Energy  conducts  credit  reviews  for  all  counterparties  and  employs credit  risk  controls,  such  as  letters  of  credit,  parental  guarantees,  master netting agreements  and  termination  provisions.  Credit  exposure  is monitored, and when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited  until  credit  enhancement  is  provided.  Distress  in  the  financial markets could increase our credit risk.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nXcel  Energy  uses  derivative  contracts  such  as  futures,  forwards,  interest rate swaps, options and FTRs to manage commodity price and interest rate risk. Derivative contracts, with the exception of those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts, are reported at fair value.\n\nXcel Energy's investments held in the nuclear decommissioning fund, rabbi trusts, pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting.\n\nCommodity Derivatives - Xcel Energy monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterparty's  ability  to  perform  on  the  transactions.  The  impact  of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nAdjustments to fair  value  for  credit  risk  of  commodity  trading  instruments are  recorded  in  electric  revenues.  Credit  risk  adjustments  for  other commodity  derivative  instruments  are  recorded  as  other  comprehensive income or deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. Classification as a regulatory  asset  or  liability  is  based  on  commission  approved  regulatory recovery  mechanisms.  The  impact  of  discounting  commodity  derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial at Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Cash Flows\n\n## Operating Cash Flows\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                      | Twelve Months Ended  Dec. 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Cash provided by operating activities - 2019               | $  3,263                       |\n| Components of change - 2020 vs. 2019                       |                                |\n| Higher net income                                          | 101                            |\n| Non-cash transactions  (a)                                 | (49)                           |\n| Changes in working capital  (b)                            | (222)                          |\n| Changes in net regulatory and other assets and liabilities | (245)                          |\n| Cash provided by operating activities - 2020               | $  2,848                       |\n\nNet  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  decreased  by  $415  million  for 2020  as  compared  to  2019.  Decrease  was  primarily  due  to  changes  in accounts  receivable  related  to  increased  residential  sales,  timing  of regulatory  asset  recovery  and  inventory  wind  turbine  purchases,  which were partially offset by an increase in net income.",

Increase  was  primarily  attributable  to  higher proceeds  from  issuances  of  long-term  debt  and  common  stock  (due  to forward equity agreements settling in November 2020 and August 2019), partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt and dividends paid.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Capital Requirements\n\nXcel  Energy  expects  to  meet  future  financing  requirements  by  periodically  issuing  short-term  debt,  long-term  debt,  common  stock,  hybrid  and  other securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios.\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments - Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future.

Actual capital expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, safety and reliability needs, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, reserve requirements, availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long-term energy needs, environmental initiatives and regulation, and mergers, acquisition and divestiture opportunities.\n\nFinancing Capital Expenditures through 2025 - Xcel Energy issues debt and equity securities to refinance retiring maturities, reduce short-term debt, fund  capital  programs,  infuse  equity  in  subsidiaries,  fund  asset  acquisitions  and  for  other  general  corporate  purposes.    Financing  plans  are  subject  to change, depending on capital expenditures, regulatory outcomes, internal cash generation, market conditions, changes in tax policies, and other factors.\n\nCurrent estimated financing plans for 2021 - 2025:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                       |           |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Funding Capital Expenditures                |           |\n| Cash from operations  (a)                   | $  15,000 |\n| New debt  (b)                               | 7,490     |\n| Equity through the DRIP and benefit program | 410       |\n| Other equity                                | 600       |\n| Base capital expenditures 2021 - 2025       | $  23,500 |\n| Maturing Debt                               | $  3,820  |\n\nThe  incremental  renewable  capital  expenditures  would  be  financed  with approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, if approved by the MPUC.\n\nCommon Stock Dividends -Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel  Energy's  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  cash  flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel  Energy  Inc.  Board  of  Directors.  In  February  2021,  Xcel  Energy announced a quarterly dividend of $0.4575 per share, which represents an increase of 6.4%.\n\nXcel Energy's dividend policy balances the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Projected cash generation.\n- \u00b7 Projected capital investment.\n- \u00b7 A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment.\n- \u00b7 The impact on Xcel Energy's capital structure and credit ratings.\n\nIn addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels.  Federal  law  places  limits  on  the  ability  of  public  utilities  within  a holding  company  to  declare  dividends.  Under  the  Federal  Power  Act,  a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries' dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants.\n\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\nPension  Fund -Xcel  Energy's  pension  assets  are  invested  in  a diversified  portfolio  of  domestic  and  international  equity  securities,  shortterm to long-duration fixed income securities and alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds.\n\nFunded status and pension assumptions:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Fair value of pension assets      | $  3,599        | $  3,184        |\n| Projected pension obligation  (a) | 3,964           | 3,701           |\n| Funded status                     | $  (365)        | $  (517)        |\n\n| Pension Assumptions               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate                     | 2.71 % | 3.49 % |\n| Expected long-term rate of return | 6.49   | 6.87   |\n\n## Capital Sources\n\nShort-Term Funding Sources -Xcel Energy generally funds short-term needs, through operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank  lines  of  credit.

These  registration  statements,  which  are  uncapped,  permit  Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries to issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future  offerings,  and  in  the  case  of  our  utility  subsidiaries,  subject  to commission approval.\n\nPlanned Financing Activity -Xcel Energy's 2021 financing plans reflect the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Xcel Energy Inc. - approximately $1.2 billion in debt financing.\n- \u00b7 PSCo - approximately $750 million of first mortgage bonds.\n- \u00b7 SPS - approximately $250 million of first mortgage bonds.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Minnesota - approximately $850 million of first mortgage bonds.\n- \u00b7 NSP-Wisconsin - approximately $125 million of first mortgage bonds.\n\nForward  Equity  Agreements -In  November  2018,  Xcel  Energy  Inc. entered  into  forward  equity  agreements  in  connection  with  a  completed $459 million public offering of  9.4  million  shares  of  Xcel  Energy  common stock. In August 2019, Xcel Energy settled the forward equity agreements by  delivering  9.4  million  shares  of  common  equity  for  cash  proceeds  of $453 million.\n\nIn November  2019,  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  entered  into  forward  equity agreements for a $743 million public offering of 11.8 million shares of Xcel Energy common stock. In November 2020, Xcel Energy settled the forward equity agreements by delivering 11.8 million shares of common equity for cash proceeds of $721 million.\n\nEquity through DRIP and Benefits Program -Xcel Energy also plans to issue approximately $75 to $90 million of equity annually through the DRIP and benefit programs during the five-year forecast time period.\n\nLong-Term Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments -See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Natural Gas Fuel and Electricity Purchases\n\nIn  February  2021,  the  United  States  experienced  winter  storm  Uri  and extreme  cold  temperatures  in  the  central  United  States.  This  severe weather event increased the demand for natural gas used in our electric and natural gas businesses. Certain operational assets were impacted by extreme  cold  temperatures  and  safety  protocols  and  the  cold  further impacted the availability of renewable generation across the region (which typically  acts  as  a  hedge  against  commodity  prices)  contributing  to extremely  high  market  prices  for  natural  gas  and  electricity.  As  a  result, electric  and  natural  gas  fuel  costs  increased  approximately  $1.2  billion (PSCo - $650 million,  NSP-Minnesota  -  $300  million,  SPS  -  $200  million and  NSP-Wisconsin  -  $45  million).  These  amounts  are  preliminary estimates through Feb. 16, 2021 and are subject to final settlement.\n\nXcel Energy has fuel recovery mechanisms in all of its states to recover the increased cost of natural gas and electricity. However, given the impact of these  higher  costs  to  our  customers  during  a  pandemic,  we  expect  our regulators to undertake a heightened review and we intend to work with our commissions to recover these costs over time to help mitigate the impacts on  customer  bills.  Xcel  Energy  is  taking  action  to  increase  planned  debt issuances  to  ensure  adequate  liquidity  for  the  timing  difference  between fuel payments and revenue collection from customers and to address any potential need to post collateral.",

        "page_content": "## Earnings Guidance\n\n2021 GAAP and ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $2.90 to $3.00 per share. (a)\n\nKey assumptions as compared with 2020 levels unless noted:\n\n- \u00b7 Constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings.\n- \u00b7 Modest impacts from COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year.\n- \u00b7 Weather-normalized  retail  electric  sales  are  projected  to  increase ~1%.\n- \u00b7 Weather-normalized retail  firm  natural  gas  sales  are  projected  to  be relatively flat.\n- \u00b7 Capital  rider  revenue  is  projected  to  increase  $105  million  to  $115 million  (net  of  PTCs).  The  change  reflects  the  deferral  of  advanced grid  costs,  which  were  denied  rider  recovery.  PTCs  are  credited  to customers, through capital riders, fuel clause or base rates and results in a reduction to electric margin.\n- \u00b7 O&M expenses are projected to be relatively flat.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation  expense  is  projected  to  increase  approximately  $195 million to $205 million.\n- \u00b7 Property taxes are projected to increase approximately $45 million to $55 million.\n- \u00b7 Interest  expense  (net  of  AFUDC  -  debt)  is  projected  to  increase  $0 million to $10 million.\n- \u00b7 AFUDC - equity is  projected  to  decline  approximately  $45  million  to $55 million.\n- \u00b7 ETR  is  projected  to  be  ~(9%).  The  ETR  reflects  benefits  of  PTCs which are credited to customers through electric margin and will not have a material impact on net income.\n- (a) Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management's view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing  earnings  could  differ  from  those  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  for unplanned  and/or  unknown  adjustments.  Xcel  Energy  is  unable  to  forecast  if  any  of these items will occur or provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nXcel Energy does not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, other than those  currently  disclosed,  that  have  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAlthough  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  led  to  numerous  challenges,  Xcel Energy  believes  its  risk  management  program,  including  business continuity  and  disaster  recovery  planning,  will  continue  to  allow  us  to proactively  manage  and  successfully  navigate  challenges,  risks  and uncertainties.\n\nThere  is  continued  uncertainty  regarding  COVID-19,  the  duration  and magnitude of business restrictions, re-shut downs and the level and pace of economic recovery. Also, while we may implement contingency plans, there are no guarantees these plans will be sufficient to offset the impact of the pandemic, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\n\nAn  overview  of  certain  risk  considerations  or  areas  which  have  or  could significantly impact us, is as follows.\n\nSales -  Xcel  Energy  has  experienced  and  may  continue  to  experience higher residential sales and lower C&I sales as a result of COVID-19. Xcel Energy  has  decoupling  and  sales  true-up  mechanisms  in  Minnesota  (all electric  classes)  and  Colorado  (residential  and  non-demand  small  C&I electric  classes),  which  mitigate  the  impact  of  changes  to  sales  levels  as compared to a baseline.\n\nBad  Debt -  Bad  debt  expense  could  significantly  increase  due  to pandemic  related  economic  impacts,  customer  hardship,  federal  or  state legislation  and  regulatory  orders.  However,  several  of  our  commissions have  approved  the  deferral  of  incremental  COVID-19  related  expense, including bad debt expense.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  received  orders  in  Colorado,  Wisconsin,  Texas,  New Mexico,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota  and  Michigan,  allowing  regulatory deferral  of  incremental  COVID-19  costs  as  a  regulatory  asset  subject  to future  determination  of  amount  and  timing  of  recovery.  As  part  of  NSPMinnesota's  stay-out  alternative,  NSP-Minnesota  agreed  to  not  seek recovery of incremental COVID-19 related costs.\n\nThe majority  of  wholesale  customers  are  subject  to  formula  transmission and production rates, which true-up rates to actual costs to serve.\n\nSupply Chain and Capital Expenditures - Xcel Energy's ability to meet customer  energy  requirements,  respond  to  storm-related  disruptions  and execute our capital expenditure program are dependent on maintaining an efficient supply chain. During 2020, Xcel Energy did not experience supply chain,  contractor  or  employee  disruptions  with  the  exception  of  delays  in certain wind projects.\n\nLiquidity -  Xcel  Energy  took  steps  to  enhance  its  liquidity  in  2020  and believes it has more than adequate liquidity. Xcel Energy will take steps to enhance liquidity in 2021 if needed.\n\n## ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nSee Item 7, incorporated by reference.\n\n## ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nSee Item 15-1 for an index of financial statements included herein.\n\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xcel Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  to  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audits  also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce, (collectively with state utility regulatory agencies, the 'Commissions'). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  to  prepare  its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and income taxes.\n\nThe Company is subject to regulatory rate setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in assets required to deliver services to customers. Accounting for the Company's regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. In the  rate  setting  process,  the  Company's  rates  result  in  the  recording  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  the  probability  of  future  cash  flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently  completed  plant,  and  3)  a  refund  due  to  customers.  Given  that  management's  accounting  judgements  are  based  on  assumptions  about  the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n- \u00b7 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We also evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. If the full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We evaluated the external information and compared to the Company's recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n- \u00b7 We obtained management's analysis and correspondence from counsel, as appropriate, regarding regulatory assets or liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 17, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

        "page_content": "## XCEL ENERGY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGeneral -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility  subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the regulated  generation,  purchase,  transmission,  distribution  and  sale  of electricity  and  in  the  regulated  purchase,  transportation,  distribution  and sale of natural gas.\n\nXcel Energy's regulated operations include the activities of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin,  PSCo  and  SPS.  These  utility  subsidiaries  serve  electric and natural  gas  customers  in  portions  of  Colorado,  Michigan,  Minnesota, New  Mexico,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Texas  and  Wisconsin.  Also included in regulated operations are WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, and WYCO, a joint venture with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.'s  nonregulated  subsidiaries  include  Eloigne,  Capital Services  and  Nicollet  Project  Holdings.  Eloigne  invests  in  rental  housing projects  that  qualify  for  low-income  housing  tax  credits.  Capital  Services procures  equipment  for  construction  of  renewable  generation  facilities  at other subsidiaries. Nicollet Project Holdings invests in nonregulated assets such  as  the  MEC  generating  facility  (through  July  2020)  and  Minnesota community solar  gardens.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  owns  the  following  additional direct subsidiaries, some of which are intermediate holding companies with additional  subsidiaries:  Xcel  Energy  Wholesale  Group  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy Markets  Holdings  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy  Ventures  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy  Retail Holdings  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy  Communications  Group,  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy International  Inc.,  Xcel  Energy  Transmission  Holding  Company,  LLC, Nicollet  Holdings  Company,  LLC,  Nicollet  Project  Holdings  LLC,  Xcel Energy Venture Holdings Inc. and Xcel Energy Services Inc. Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as Xcel Energy.\n\nXcel  Energy's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  its  wholly-owned subsidiaries  and  VIEs  for  which  it  is  the  primary  beneficiary.  All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated, unless a different treatment is appropriate for rate regulated transactions.\n\nXcel  Energy  uses  the  equity  method  of  accounting  for  its  investment  in WYCO.  Xcel  Energy's  equity  earnings  in  WYCO  are  included  on  the consolidated  statements  of  income  as  equity  earnings  of  unconsolidated subsidiaries.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  investments  in  certain  plants  and  transmission  facilities jointly  owned with nonaffiliated utilities. Xcel Energy's proportionate share of jointly owned facilities is recorded as property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, and Xcel Energy's proportionate share of the  operating  costs  associated  with  these  facilities  is  included  in  its consolidated statements of income.\n\nXcel Energy's  consolidated  financial statements  are  presented  in accordance with GAAP. All of the utility subsidiaries' underlying accounting records  also  conform  to  the  FERC  uniform  system  of  accounts.  Certain amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or  notes  have  been reclassified  for  comparative  purposes;  however, such reclassifications did not affect net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.\n\nXcel Energy has evaluated events occurring after Dec. 31, 2020 up to the date  of  issuance  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  These statements  contain  all  necessary  adjustments  and  disclosures  resulting from that evaluation.\n\nUse  of  Estimates -  Xcel  Energy  uses  estimates  based  on  the  best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations.\n\nEstimates  are  used  on  items  such  as  plant  depreciable  lives  or  potential disallowances,  AROs,  certain  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  tax provisions, uncollectible amounts, environmental costs, unbilled revenues, jurisdictional  fuel  and  energy  cost  allocations  and  actuarially  determined benefit  costs.  Recorded  estimates  are  revised  when  better  information becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  can  be  determined.  Revisions  can affect operating results.\n\nRegulatory Accounting - Xcel Energy Inc.'s regulated utility subsidiaries account  for  income  and  expense  items  in  accordance  with  accounting guidance for regulated operations. Under this guidance:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain costs, which would otherwise be charged to expense or other comprehensive  income,  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  based  on the expected ability to recover the costs in future rates.\n- \u00b7 Certain credits, which would otherwise be reflected as income or other comprehensive income, are deferred as regulatory liabilities based on the  expectation  the  amounts  will  be  returned  to  customers  in  future rates,  or  because  the  amounts  were  collected  in  rates  prior  to  the costs being incurred.\n\nEstimates of recovering deferred costs and returning deferred credits are based  on  specific  ratemaking  decisions  or  precedent  for  each  item. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment in the rate setting process.\n\nIf changes in the regulatory environment occur, the utility subsidiaries may no  longer  be  eligible  to  apply  this  accounting  treatment  and  may  be required  to  eliminate  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  from  their  balance sheets. Such changes could have a material effect on Xcel Energy's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nSee Note 4 for further information.\n\nIncome Taxes - Xcel Energy accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  for  the  expected  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have been included in the financial statements. Xcel Energy defers income taxes for  all  temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income and between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Xcel Energy uses  rates  that  are  scheduled  to  be  in  effect  when  the  temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe  effects  of  tax  rate  changes  that  are  attributable  to  the  utility subsidiaries are generally subject to a normalization method of accounting. Therefore,  the  revaluation  of  most  of  the  utility  subsidiaries'  net  deferred taxes  upon  a  tax  rate  reduction  results  in  the  establishment  of  a  net regulatory liability, which would be refundable to utility customers over the remaining life of the related assets. Xcel Energy anticipates that a tax rate increase would result in the establishment of a regulatory asset, subject to regulatory approval.",

        "page_content": "Reversal  of  certain  temporary  differences  are  accounted  for  as  current income tax expense due to the effects of past regulatory practices  when deferred  taxes  were  not  required  to  be  recorded  due  to  the  use  of  flow through  accounting  for  ratemaking  purposes.  Tax  credits  are  recorded when  earned  unless  there  is  a  requirement  to  defer  the  benefit  and amortize  it  over  the  book  depreciable  lives  of  the  related  property.  The requirement to defer and amortize tax credits only applies to federal ITCs related to public utility property. Utility rate regulation also has resulted in the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities related to income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than  not  that  some  portion  or  all  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  will  not  be realized.\n\nXcel  Energy  follows  the  applicable  accounting  guidance  to  measure  and disclose uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take in its income  tax  returns.  Xcel  Energy  recognizes  a  tax  position  in  its consolidated  financial  statements  when  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of  the  position.  Recognition  of  changes  in  uncertain  tax  positions  are reflected as a component of income tax expense.\n\nXcel Energy reports interest and penalties related to income taxes within other (expense) income or interest charges in the consolidated statements of income, based on the underlying nature of the transaction.\n\nXcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  file  consolidated  federal  income  tax returns  as  well  as  consolidated  or  separate  state  income  tax  returns. Federal  income  taxes  paid  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  are  allocated  to  its subsidiaries based on separate company computations. A similar allocation is made for state income taxes paid by Xcel Energy Inc. in connection with consolidated  state  filings.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  also  allocates  its  own  income tax benefits to its direct subsidiaries.\n\nSee Note 7 for further information.\n\nProperty,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  Depreciation  in  Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of plant includes direct labor and materials, contracted work, overhead costs  and  AFUDC.  The  cost  of  plant  retired  is  charged  to  accumulated depreciation  and  amortization.  Amounts  recovered  in  rates  for  future removal costs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Significant additions or improvements  extending  asset  lives  are  capitalized,  while  repairs  and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Maintenance and replacement  of  items  determined  to  be  less  than  a  unit  of  property  are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Planned maintenance activities are  charged  to  operating  expense  unless  the  cost  represents  the acquisition  of  an  additional  unit  of  property  or  the  replacement  of  an existing unit of property.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  tested  for  impairment  when  it  is determined that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. A loss is recognized in the current period if it becomes probable that part of a cost  of  a  plant  under  construction  or  recently  completed  plant  will  be disallowed for recovery from customers and a reasonable estimate of the disallowance  can  be  made.  For  investments  in  property,  plant  and equipment  that  are  abandoned  and  not  expected  to  go  into  service, incurred  costs  and  related  deferred  tax  amounts  are  compared  to  the discounted  estimated  future  rate  recovery,  and  a  loss  is  recognized,  if necessary.\n\nXcel  Energy  records  depreciation  expense  using  the  straight-line  method over  the  plant's  useful  life.  Actuarial  life  studies  are  performed  and submitted  to  the  state  and  federal  commissions  for  review.  Upon acceptance by the various commissions, the resulting lives and net salvage rates  are  used  to  calculate  depreciation.  Plant  removal  costs  of  Xcel Energy's  utility  subsidiaries  are  recovered  in  rates  as  authorized  by  the appropriate regulatory entities. The amount of removal costs are based on current  factors  used  in  existing  depreciation  rates.  Accumulated  removal costs  are  reflected  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  a  regulatory liability.  Depreciation  expense,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  average depreciable property, was approximately 3.4% for 2020, 3.3% for 2019 and 3.1% for 2018.\n\nSee Note 3 for further information.\n\nAROs -Xcel Energy accounts for AROs under accounting guidance that requires  a  liability  for  the  fair  value  of  an  ARO  to  be  recognized  in  the period  in  which  it  is  incurred  if  it  can  be  reasonably  estimated,  with  the offsetting  associated  asset  retirement  costs  capitalized  as  a  long-lived asset. The liability is generally increased over time by applying the effective interest method of accretion, and the capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the  timing  or  amount  of  expected  asset  retirement  cash  flows  are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nNuclear  Decommissioning -  Nuclear  decommissioning  studies  that estimate  NSP-Minnesota's  costs  of  decommissioning  its  nuclear  power plants are performed at least every three years and submitted to the state commissions for approval.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recovers regulator-approved decommissioning costs of its nuclear  power  plants  over  each  facility's  expected  service  life,  typically based  on  the  triennial  decommissioning  studies.  The  studies  consider estimated  future  costs  of  decommissioning  and  the  market  value  of investments  in  trust  funds  and  recommend  annual  funding  amounts. Amounts collected in  rates  are  deposited  in  the  trust  funds.  For  financial reporting purposes, NSP-Minnesota accounts for nuclear decommissioning as an ARO.\n\nRestricted funds for the payment of future decommissioning expenditures for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are included in nuclear decommissioning  fund  and  other  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 12 for further information.\n\nBenefit  Plans  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits -  Xcel  Energy maintains pension and postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Recognizing  the  cost  of  providing  benefits  and  measuring  the  projected benefit  obligation  of  these  plans  requires  management  to  make  various assumptions and estimates.\n\nCertain  unrecognized  actuarial  gains  and  losses  and  unrecognized  prior service  costs  or  credits  are  deferred  as  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities, rather than recorded as other comprehensive income, based on regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 11 for further information.",

        "page_content": "Environmental  Costs -  Environmental  costs  are  recorded  when  it  is probable Xcel Energy is liable for remediation costs and the liability can be reasonably  estimated.  Costs  are  deferred  as  a  regulatory  asset  if  it  is probable  that  the  costs  will  be  recovered  from  customers  in  future  rates. Otherwise, the costs are expensed. If an environmental expense is related to facilities currently in use, such as emission-control equipment, the cost is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the plant.\n\nEstimated  remediation  costs  are  regularly  adjusted  as  estimates  are revised  and  remediation  proceeds.  If  other  participating  potentially responsible parties exist and acknowledge their potential involvement with a site,  costs  are  estimated and recorded only for Xcel Energy's expected share of the cost.\n\nFuture  costs  of  restoring  sites  are  treated  as  a  capitalized  cost  of  plant retirement. The depreciation expense levels recoverable in rates include a provision for removal expenses. Removal costs recovered in rates before the related costs are incurred are classified as a regulatory liability.\n\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n\nRevenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers -  Performance  obligations related  to  the  sale  of  energy  are  satisfied  as  energy  is  delivered  to customers. Xcel Energy recognizes revenue that corresponds to the price of the energy delivered to the customer. The measurement of energy sales to  customers  is  generally  based  on  the  reading  of  their  meters,  which occurs  systematically  throughout  the  month.  At  the  end  of  each  month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading  are  estimated,  and  the  corresponding  unbilled  revenue  is recognized.\n\nXcel  Energy  does  not  recognize  a  separate  financing  component  of  its collections from customers as contract terms are short-term in nature. Xcel Energy presents its revenues net of any excise or sales taxes or fees. The utility  subsidiaries  recognize physical sales to customers (native load and wholesale)  on  a  gross  basis  in  electric  revenues  and  cost  of  sales. Revenues and charges for short-term physical wholesale sales of excess energy transacted through RTOs are also recorded on a gross basis. Other revenues and charges settled/facilitated through an RTO are recorded on a net basis in cost of sales.\n\nSee Note 6 for further information.\n\nCash  and  Cash  Equivalents -  Xcel  Energy  considers  investments  in instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\nAccounts  Receivable  and  Allowance  for  Bad  Debts -  Accounts receivable  are  stated  at  the  actual  billed  amount  net  of  an  allowance  for bad  debts.  Xcel  Energy  establishes  an  allowance  for  uncollectible receivables  based  on  a  policy  that  reflects  its  expected  exposure  to  the credit risk of customers.\n\nAs of  Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for bad debts was $79 million and $55 million, respectively.\n\nInventory - Inventory is  recorded  at  average  cost  and  consisted  of  the following:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Inventories             |                 |                 |\n| Materials and supplies  | $  275          | $  270          |\n| Fuel                    | 176             | 191             |\n| Natural gas             | 84              | 83              |\n| Total inventories       | $  535          | $  544          |\n\nFair  Value  Measurements -  Xcel  Energy  presents  cash  equivalents, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives and nuclear decommissioning  fund  assets  at  estimated  fair  values  in  its  consolidated financial statements.\n\nCash equivalents are recorded at cost plus accrued interest; money market funds  are  measured  using  quoted  NAVs.  For  interest  rate  derivatives, quoted prices based primarily on observable market interest rate curves are used  to  establish  fair  value.  For  commodity  derivatives,  the  most observable inputs available are generally used to determine the fair value of each contract. In the absence of a quoted price, Xcel Energy may use quoted prices for similar contracts or internally prepared valuation models to determine fair value.\n\nFor the pension and postretirement plan assets and nuclear decommissioning  fund,  published  trading  data  and  pricing  models, generally  using  the  most  observable  inputs  available,  are  utilized  to estimate fair value for each security.\n\nSee Notes 10 and 11 for further information.\n\nDerivative  Instruments -  Xcel  Energy  uses  derivative  instruments  in connection  with  its  interest  rate,  utility  commodity  price  and  commodity trading  activities,  including  forward  contracts,  futures,  swaps  and  options. Any  derivative  instruments  not  qualifying  for  the  normal  purchases  and normal sales exception are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as derivative instruments. Classification of changes in fair value for  those  derivative  instruments  is  dependent  on  the  designation  of  a qualifying  hedging  relationship.  Changes  in  fair  value  of  derivative instruments not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are reflected in  current earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability. Classification as a regulatory  asset  or  liability  is  based  on  commission  approved  regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nGains  or  losses  on  commodity  trading  transactions  are  recorded  as  a component  of  electric  operating  revenues  and  interest  rate  hedging transactions are recorded as a component of interest expense.\n\nNormal  Purchases  and  Normal  Sales -  Xcel  Energy  enters  into contracts for purchases and sales of commodities for use in its operations. At  inception,  contracts  are  evaluated  to  determine  whether  a  derivative exists  and/or  whether  an  instrument  may  be  exempted  from  derivative accounting if designated as a normal purchase or normal sale.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.\n\nCommodity  Trading  Operations -  All  applicable  gains  and  losses related to commodity trading activities are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nCommodity trading activities are not associated with energy produced from Xcel Energy's generation assets or energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading contracts are recorded at fair market value and  commodity  trading  results  include  the  impact  of  all  margin-sharing mechanisms.\n\nSee Note 10 for further information.\n\n## Other Utility Items\n\nAFUDC -AFUDC  represents  the  cost  of  capital  used  to  finance  utility construction  activity.  AFUDC  is  computed  by  applying  a  composite financing  rate  to  qualified  CWIP.  The  amount  of  AFUDC  capitalized  as  a utility construction cost is credited to other nonoperating income (for equity capital) and interest charges (for debt capital). AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in Xcel Energy's rate base for establishing utility rates.",

        "page_content": "Alternative  Revenue -  Certain  rate  rider  mechanisms  (including decoupling  and  CIP/DSM  programs)  qualify  as  alternative  revenue programs. These mechanisms arise from costs imposed upon the utility by action of a regulator or legislative body related to an environmental, public safety or other mandate. When certain criteria are met, including expected collection  within  24  months,  revenue  is  recognized  equal  to  the  revenue requirement, which may include incentives and return on rate base items. Billing  amounts  are  revised  periodically  for  differences  between  total amount collected and revenue earned, which may increase or decrease the level  of  revenue  collected  from  customers.  Alternative  revenues  arising from  these  programs  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  and  disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nSee Note 6 for further information.\n\nConservation Programs -Costs incurred for DSM and CIP programs are deferred  if  it  is  probable  future  revenue  will  recover  the  incurred  cost. Revenues  recognized  for  incentive  programs  for  the  recovery  of  lost margins and/or conservation performance incentives are limited to amounts expected to be collected within 24 months from the year they are earned. Regulatory assets are recognized to reflect the amount of costs or earned incentives that have not yet been collected from customers.\n\nEmission  Allowances -Emission  allowances  are  recorded  at  cost, including  broker  commission  fees.  The  inventory  accounting  model  is utilized  for  all  emission  allowances  and  sales  of  these  allowances  are included in electric revenues.\n\nNuclear  Refueling  Outage  Costs -  Xcel  Energy  uses  a  deferral  and amortization  method  for  nuclear  refueling  costs.  This  method  amortizes costs  over  the  period  between  refueling  outages  consistent  with  rate recovery.\n\nRECs -Cost  of  RECs  that  are  utilized  for  compliance  is  recorded  as electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expense.  In  certain  jurisdictions,  Xcel Energy reduces recoverable fuel costs for  the  cost  of  RECs  and  records that  cost  as  a  regulatory  asset  when  the  amount  is  recoverable  in  future rates.\n\nSales of RECs are recorded in electric revenues on a gross basis. The cost of  these  RECs  and  amounts  credited  to  customers  under  margin-sharing mechanisms are recorded in electric fuel and purchased power expense.\n\nCost of RECs that are utilized to support commodity trading activities are recorded in a similar manner as the associated commodities and are shown on a net basis in electric operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## 2.   Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently Adopted\n\nCredit Losses -In 2016, the FASB issued Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 326 (ASC Topic 326), which changes how entities account for losses on receivables and certain other assets. The guidance requires use  of  a  current  expected  credit  loss  model,  which  may  result  in  earlier recognition of credit losses than under previous accounting standards.\n\nXcel  Energy  implemented  the  guidance  using  a  modified-retrospective approach, recognizing a cumulative effect charge of $2 million (after tax) to retained earnings on Jan. 1, 2020. Other than first-time recognition of an allowance for bad debts on accrued unbilled revenues, the Jan. 1, 2020, adoption  of  ASC  Topic  326  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  Xcel Energy's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3.

Income Taxes\n\nFederal Loss Carryback Claims In 2020, Xcel Energy identified certain expense  related  to  tax  years  2009  -  2011  that  qualify  for  an  extended carryback claim. As a result, a tax benefit of approximately $13 million was recognized in 2020.\n\nFederal  Audit -  Statute  of  limitations  applicable  to  Xcel  Energy's consolidated federal income tax returns:\n\n| Tax Year(s)   | Expiration   |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| 2014 - 2016   | July 2021    |\n\nAdditionally,  the  statute  of  limitations  related  to  the  federal  tax  loss carryback  claim  referenced  above  has  been  extended.  Xcel  Energy  has recognized its best estimate of income tax expense that will result from a final  resolution  of  this  issue;  however,  the  outcome  and  timing  of  a resolution is unknown.\n\nIn  2017,  the  IRS  concluded  the  audit  of  tax  years  2012  and  2013  and proposed an adjustment that would impact Xcel Energy's NOL and ETR. Xcel  Energy  file  a  protest  with  the  IRS.  In  April  2020,  Xcel  Energy  and Appeals reached an agreement and no material adjustments were required.\n\nIn 2018, the IRS began an audit of tax years 2014 - 2016.  In July 2020, Xcel  Energy  and  the  IRS  reached  an  agreement  and  the  related  benefit was recognized.\n\nState Audits - Xcel Energy files consolidated state tax returns based on income in its major operating jurisdictions and various other state incomebased tax returns.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2020,  Xcel  Energy's  earliest  open  tax  years  (subject  to examination by state taxing authorities in its major operating jurisdictions) were as follows:\n\n| State     |   Year |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Colorado  |   2009 |\n| Minnesota |   2009 |\n| Texas     |   2012 |\n| Wisconsin |   2014 |\n\n- \u00b7 In  2018,  Wisconsin  began  an  audit  of  tax  years  2014  -  2016.  As  of Dec. 31, 2020, no material adjustments have been proposed.\n- \u00b7 In July 2020, Minnesota began a review of the 2015 - 2018 Research and  Experimentation  Credits.  As  of    Dec.  31,  2020,  no  material adjustments have been proposed.\n- \u00b7 Xcel Energy had no other state income tax audits in progress for its major operating jurisdictions as of Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits - Unrecognized tax benefit balance includes permanent tax positions, which if recognized would affect the annual ETR. In  addition,  the  unrecognized  tax  benefit  balance  includes  temporary  tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. A change in the period  of  deductibility  would  not  affect  the  ETR  but  would  accelerate  the payment to the taxing authority to an earlier period.\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits - permanent vs. temporary:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                              | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Unrecognized tax benefit - Permanent tax positions | $  41           | $  35           |\n| Unrecognized tax benefit - Temporary tax positions | 11              | 9               |\n| Total unrecognized tax benefit                     | $  52           | $  44           |",

At the  end  of  the  restricted  period,  such  grants  will  be  awarded  if  vesting conditions and/or performance goals are met.\n\nCertain employees are granted equity awards with a portion subject only to service conditions, and the other portion subject to performance conditions. A total of 0.2 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million time-based equity shares subject only to service conditions were granted annually in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe performance conditions for a portion of the awards granted from 2018 to 2020 are based on relative TSR and environmental goals. Equity awards with  performance  conditions  will  be  settled  or  forfeited  after  three  years, with payouts ranging from zero to 200 percent depending on achievement.\n\nEquity award units granted to employees (excluding restricted stock):\n\n| (Units in Thousands)                    | 2020     | 2019     | 2018     |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Granted units                           | 411      | 483      | 500      |\n| Weighted average grant date  fair value | $  62.92 | $  49.67 | $  47.60 |\n\n| (Units in Thousands, Fair  Value in Millions)   |   2020 |   2019 | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Vested Units                                    |    442 |    464 | 475    |\n| Total Fair Value                                |     29 |     29 | $  23  |\n\nChanges in the nonvested portion of equity award units:\n\n| (Units in Thousands)             | Units   |   Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |\n|----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| Nonvested Units at Jan. 1, 2020  | 880     |                                    48.2  |\n| Granted                          | 411     |                                    62.92 |\n| Forfeited                        | (101)   |                                    53.87 |\n| Vested                           | (442)   |                                    47.63 |\n| Dividend equivalents             | 32      |                                    51.56 |\n| Nonvested Units at Dec. 31, 2020 | 780     |                                    55.68 |\n\nStock  Equivalent  Units -Non-employee  members  of  Xcel  Energy's Board of Directors may elect to receive their annual equity grant as stock equivalent units in lieu of common stock. Each unit's value is equal to one share of common stock. The annual equity grant is vested as of the date of each  member's  election  to  the  Board  of  Directors;  there  is  no  further service  or  other  condition.  Directors  may  also  elect  to  receive  their  cash fees  as  stock  equivalent  units  in  lieu  of  cash.

This plan allows Xcel Energy to attach various performance goals  to  the  awards  granted.  The  liability  awards  have  been  historically dependent  on  relative  TSR  measured  over  a  three-year  period.  Xcel Energy Inc.'s TSR is compared to a peer group of other utility companies. Potential payouts of the awards range from zero to 200%.",

Additionally, approximately 0.2 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million of equity award units were granted in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, with vesting subject only to service conditions of three years.\n\nGenerally,  these  instruments  are  considered  to  be  equity  awards  as  the award settlement determination (shares or cash) is made by Xcel Energy, not  the  participants.  In  addition,  these  awards  have  not  been  previously settled  in  cash  and  Xcel  Energy  plans  to  continue  electing  share settlement.\n\nGrant date fair value of equity awards is expensed over the service period. TSR liability awards have been historically settled partially in cash, and do not qualify as equity awards, but rather are accounted for as liabilities. As liability  awards,  the  fair  value  on  which  ratable  expense  is  based,  as employees vest in their rights to those awards, is remeasured each period based on the current stock price and performance achievement, and final expense is based on the market value of the shares on the date the award is settled.\n\nCompensation costs related to share-based awards:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                         | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Compensation cost for share-based awards  (a) | $  73  | $  58  | $  45  |\n| Tax benefit recognized in income              | 19     | 15     | 12     |\n\nThere  was  approximately  $51  million  in  2020  and  $40  million  in  2019  of total  unrecognized  compensation  cost  related  to  nonvested  share-based compensation awards. Xcel Energy expects to recognize the unrecognized amount over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.\n\n## 9.   Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic  EPS  was  computed  by  dividing  the  earnings  available  to  common shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS was computed by dividing the earnings  available  to  common  shareholders  by  the  diluted  weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if  securities  or  other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled.  The  weighted  average  number  of  potentially  dilutive  shares outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.\n\nCommon  Stock  Equivalents -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  has  common  stock equivalents related to forward equity agreements and certain equity awards in  share-based  compensation  arrangements.  Common  stock  equivalents include commitments to issue common stock related to time-based equity compensation awards.\n\nStock  equivalent  units  granted  to  Xcel  Energy's  Board  of  Directors  are included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon  grant  date  as  there  is  no further  service,  performance  or  market  condition  associated  with  these. Restricted stock issued to employees under the Executive Annual Incentive Award Plan is included in common shares outstanding when granted.\n\nShare-based  compensation  arrangements  for  which  there  is  currently  no dilutive impact to EPS include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  included  in common  shares  outstanding  when  all  necessary  conditions  for settlement have been satisfied by the end of the reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Liability  awards  subject  to  a  performance  condition;  any  portions settled  in  shares  are  included  in  common  shares  outstanding  upon settlement.\n\nDiluted common shares outstanding included common stock equivalents of 1.1  million,  1.3  million  and  0.5  million  shares  for  2020,  2019  and  2018, respectively.\n\n## 10.   Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nAccounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a single definition of fair value and requires disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. A hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is established by this guidance.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 -Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities  included  in  Level  1  are  highly  liquid  and  actively  traded instruments with quoted prices.\n- \u00b7 Level  2 -Pricing  inputs  are  other  than  quoted  prices  in  active markets  but  are  either  directly  or  indirectly  observable  as  of  the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are  typically  either  comparable  to  actively  traded  securities  or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 -Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of  the  reporting  date.  The  types  of  assets  and  liabilities  included  in Level 3 are those valued with models  requiring significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nSpecific valuation methods include:\n\nCash  equivalents -The  fair  values  of  cash  equivalents  are  generally based  on  cost  plus  accrued  interest;  money  market  funds  are  measured using quoted NAV.\n\nInvestments  in  equity  securities  and  other  funds -Equity  securities are  valued  using  quoted  prices  in  active  markets.  The  fair  values  for commingled  funds  are  measured  using  NAVs.  The  investments  in commingled funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice. Private equity  commingled fund investments require approval of the fund for any unscheduled  redemption,  and  such  redemptions  may  be  approved  or denied  by  the  fund  at  its  sole  discretion.  Unscheduled  distributions  from real  estate  commingled  fund  investments  may  be  redeemed  with  proper notice, however, withdrawals may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity.",

        "page_content": "Investments  in  debt  securities -Fair  values  for  debt  securities  are determined  by  a  third-party  pricing  service  using  recent  trades  and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.\n\nInterest  rate  derivatives -Fair  values  of  interest  rate  derivatives  are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest rate forecasts.\n\nCommodity  derivatives -Methods  used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of commodity  derivative  forwards  and  options  utilize  forward  prices  and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are  generally  assigned  a  Level  2  classification.  When  contractual settlements relate to inactive delivery locations or extend to periods beyond those  readily  observable  on  active  exchanges  or  quoted  by  brokers,  the significance of the use of less observable forecasts of forward prices and volatilities  on  a  valuation  is  evaluated  and  may  result  in  Level  3 classification.\n\nElectric  commodity  derivatives  held  by  NSP-Minnesota  and  SPS  include transmission congestion instruments, generally referred to as FTRs. FTRs purchased from a RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.\n\nThe value of an FTR is derived from, and designed to offset, the cost of transmission congestion. In addition to overall transmission load, congestion is also influenced by the operating schedules of power plants and the consumption of electricity pertinent to a given transmission path. Unplanned  plant  outages,  scheduled  plant  maintenance,  changes  in  the relative costs of fuels used in generation, weather and overall changes in demand  for  electricity  can  each  impact  the  operating  schedules  of  the power plants on the transmission grid and the value of an FTR.\n\nIf forecasted costs of electric transmission congestion increase or decrease for  a  given  FTR  path,  the  value  of  that  particular  FTR  instrument  will likewise  increase  or  decrease.  Given  the  limited  observability  of  certain inputs to the value of FTRs between auction processes, including expected plant  operating  schedules  and  retail  and  wholesale  demand,  fair  value measurements for FTRs have been assigned a Level 3.\n\nNon-trading monthly FTR settlements are included in fuel and purchased energy  cost  recovery  mechanisms  as  applicable  in  each  jurisdiction,  and therefore changes in the fair value of the yet to be settled portions of most FTRs are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. Given this regulatory treatment and the limited magnitude of FTRs relative to the electric utility operations  of  NSP-Minnesota  and  SPS,  the  numerous  unobservable quantitative  inputs  pertinent  to  the  value  of  FTRs  are  immaterial  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Nuclear Decommissioning Fund\n\nThe NRC requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating plants. Assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the purpose of decommissioning these facilities. The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities,  equity  securities  and  other  investments.  NSP-Minnesota  uses the  MPUC  approved  asset  allocation  for  the  investment  targets  by  asset class for the qualified trust.\n\nNSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning over the lives of the nuclear plants, assuming rate recovery of all costs. Realized and  unrealized  gains  on  fund  investments  over  the  life  of  the  fund  are deferred  as  an  offset  of  NSP-Minnesota's  regulatory  asset  for  nuclear decommissioning costs. Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset.\n\nUnrealized gains for the nuclear decommissioning fund were $981 million and  $706  million  as  of  Dec.  31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively,  and unrealized losses were $5 million and $6 million as of Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nNon-derivative instruments with recurring fair value measurements:\n\n|                                   | Dec. 31, 2020                     | Dec. 31, 2020                     | Dec. 31, 2020                     | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                   |                                   | Fair Value                        | Fair Value                        | Fair Value      | Fair Value      | Fair Value      |\n| (Millions of Dollars)             | Cost                              | Level 1                           | Level 2                           | Level 3         | NAV             | Total           |\n| Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) | Nuclear decommissioning fund  (a) |                 |                 |                 |\n| Cash equivalents                  | $  40                             | $  40                             | $  -

These  derivative instruments are generally designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, with changes in fair value prior to settlement recorded as other comprehensive income.\n\nAs  of  Dec.  31,  2020,  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  related  to settled interest rate derivatives included $6 million of net losses expected to be  reclassified  into  earnings  during  the  next  12  months  as  the  hedged transactions  impact  earnings.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2020,  Xcel  Energy  had  no unsettled interest rate derivatives.\n\nWholesale  and  Commodity  Trading  Risk -Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s  utility subsidiaries  conduct  various  wholesale  and  commodity  trading  activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy, energy-related instruments and natural gas-related instruments, including derivatives. Xcel Energy  is  allowed  to  conduct  these  activities  within  guidelines  and limitations  as  approved  by  its  risk  management  committee,  comprised  of management personnel not directly involved in activities governed by this policy.\n\nCommodity Derivatives -Xcel Energy enters into derivative instruments to  manage  variability  of  future  cash  flows  from  changes  in  commodity prices  in  its  electric  and  natural  gas  operations,  as  well  as  for  trading purposes.    This  could  include  the  purchase  or  sale  of  energy  or  energyrelated  products,  natural  gas  to  generate  electric  energy,  natural  gas  for resale, FTRs, vehicle fuel and weather derivatives.\n\nXcel Energy may enter into derivative instruments that mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers but may not be designated  as  qualifying  hedging  transactions.  The  classification  as  a regulatory asset or liability, if applicable, is based on approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2020, Xcel Energy had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nXcel  Energy  enters  into  commodity  derivative  instruments  for  trading purposes  not  directly  related  to  commodity  price  risks  associated  with serving its electric and natural gas customers. Changes in the fair value of these  commodity  derivatives  are  recorded  in  electric  operating  revenues, net of amounts credited to customers under margin-sharing mechanisms.\n\nGross notional amounts of commodity forwards, options and FTRs:\n\n| (Amounts in Millions)  (a)(b)   |   Dec. 31, 2020 |   Dec. 31, 2019 |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| MWh of electricity              |              87 |              95 |\n| MMBtu of natural gas            |             175 |             110 |\n\nConsideration  of  Credit  Risk  and  Concentrations -Xcel  Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement and assesses each counterparty's ability to perform on the transactions set forth in  the  contracts.  Impact  of  credit  risk  was  immaterial  to  the  fair  value  of unsettled  commodity  derivatives  presented  on  the  consolidated  balance sheets.\n\nXcel  Energy's  utility  subsidiaries'  most  significant  concentrations  of  credit risk with particular entities or industries are contracts with counterparties to their wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity activities.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2020, six of Xcel Energy's 10 most significant counterparties for these activities, comprising $130 million or 54% of this credit exposure, had investment grade credit ratings from S&P, Moody's or Fitch Ratings. Three of the 10 most significant counterparties, comprising $32 million or 13% of this credit exposure, were not rated by these external agencies, but based on Xcel Energy's internal analysis, had credit quality consistent with investment grade. One of these significant counterparties, comprising $17 million or 7% of this credit exposure, had credit quality less than investment grade, based on internal analysis. Eight of these significant counterparties are municipal or cooperative electric entities, RTOs or other utilities.\n\nQualifying  Cash  Flow  Hedges -Financial  impact  of  qualifying  interest rate cash flow hedges on Xcel Energy's accumulated other comprehensive loss,  included  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  common  stockholders' equity and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow  hedges at Jan. 1          | $  (80) | $  (60) | $  (58) |\n| After-tax net unrealized losses related to derivatives  accounted for as hedges      | (10)    | (23)    | (5)     |\n| After-tax net realized losses on derivative transactions  reclassified into earnings | 5       | 3       | 3       |\n| Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow  hedges at Dec. 31         | $  (85) | $  (80) | $  (60) |",

As of Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $4 million and $7 million of derivative instruments in a liability position  with  such  underlying  contract  provisions,  respectively.  Certain  contracts  also  contain  cross  default  provisions  that  may  require  the  posting  of collateral or settlement of the contracts if there was a failure under the other financing arrangements related to payment terms or other covenants. As of Dec. 31, 2020, there were approximately $60 million of derivative instruments in a liability position with such underlying contract provisions.\n\nCertain  derivative  instruments  are  also  subject  to  contract  provisions  that  contain  adequate  assurance  clauses.  Provisions  allow  counterparties  to  seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the event that a given utility subsidiary's ability to fulfill its contractual obligations is reasonably expected to be impaired.

Fair  value  estimates  are  based  on  information  available  to management as of Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, and given the observability of the inputs, fair values presented for long-term debt were assigned as Level 2.\n\n## 11.   Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits\n\nXcel Energy has several noncontributory, qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all employees. All newly hired or rehired employees participate under the Cash Balance formula, which is based on pay credits using a percentage of annual eligible pay and annual interest credits. The average annual interest crediting rates for these plans was 1.89, 2.82 and 3.62 percent in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Some employees may participate under legacy formulas such as the traditional final average pay or pension equity. Xcel Energy's policy is to fully fund into an external trust the  actuarially  determined  pension  costs  subject  to  the  limitations  of applicable employee benefit and tax laws.\n\nIn addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a SERP and  a  nonqualified  pension  plan.  The  SERP  is  maintained  for  certain executives  who  participated  in  the  plan  in  2008,  when  the  SERP  was closed to new participants.\n\nThe nonqualified pension plan provides benefits for compensation that is in excess  of  the  limits  applicable  to  the  qualified  pension  plans,  with distributions funded by Xcel Energy's consolidated operating cash flows.\n\nObligations  of  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plan  as  of  Dec.  31,  2020  and 2019  were  $43  million  and  $39  million,  respectively.  Xcel  Energy recognized  net  benefit  cost  for  the  SERP  and  nonqualified  plans  of  $6 million in 2020 and $4 million in 2019.\n\nXcel  Energy  bases  the  investment-return  assumption  on  expected  longterm  performance  for  each  of  the  asset  classes  in  its  pension  and postretirement  health  care  portfolios.  For  pension  assets,  Xcel  Energy considers the historical returns achieved by its asset portfolio over the past 20 years or longer period, as well as long-term projected return levels.\n\nPension cost determination assumes a forecasted mix of investment types over the long-term.\n\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2020 were above the assumed level of 6.87%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2019 were above the assumed level of 6.87%.\n- \u00b7 Investment returns in 2018 were below the assumed level of 6.87%.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, expected investment-return assumption is 6.49%.\n\nPension plan and postretirement benefit assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy's return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize contributions to  the  plan,  within  appropriate  levels  of  risk.  The  principal  mechanism  for achieving these objectives is the asset allocation given the long-term risk, return,  correlation  and  liquidity  characteristics  of  each  particular  asset class.  There  were  no  significant  concentrations  of  risk  in  any  industry, index, or entity. Market volatility can impact even well-diversified portfolios and significantly affect the return levels achieved by the assets in any year.\n\nState agencies also have issued guidelines to the funding of postretirement benefit costs. SPS is required to fund postretirement benefit costs for Texas and  New  Mexico  amounts  collected  in  rates.  PSCo  is  required  to  fund postretirement benefit costs in irrevocable external trusts that are dedicated to the payment of these postretirement benefits. These assets are invested in a manner consistent with the investment strategy for the pension plan.\n\nXcel  Energy's  ongoing  investment  strategy  is  based  on  plan-specific investment  recommendations  that  seek  to  minimize  potential  investment and interest  rate  risk  as  a  plan's  funded  status  increases  over  time.  The investment  recommendations  result  in  a  greater  percentage  of  longduration  fixed  income  securities  being  allocated  to  specific  plans  having relatively  higher  funded  status  ratios  and  a  greater  percentage  of  growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.",

Total  expense  to  these  plans  was  approximately $42 million in 2020, $39 million in 2019 and $38 million in 2018.\n\n## Multiemployer Plans\n\nNSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  each  contribute  to  several  union multiemployer  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans,  none  of which  are  individually  significant.  These  plans  provide  pension  and postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  certain  union  employees  who  may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSPMinnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  pension  and  postretirement health care plans.\n\nContributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs from providing benefits  under  NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin  sponsored  plans,  in that if another  participating employer  ceases  to  contribute  to  a multiemployer plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining participating employers.\n\n## 12.   Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Legal\n\nXcel Energy is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility,  and  whether  the  loss  or  a  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains  accruals  for  losses  probable  of  being  incurred  and  subject  to reasonable  estimation.  Management  is  sometimes  unable  to  estimate  an amount  or  range  of  a  reasonably  possible  loss  in  certain  situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.\n\nIn  such  cases,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  timing  or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss. For current  proceedings  not  specifically  reported,  management  does  not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on Xcel  Energy's  financial  statements.  Unless  otherwise  required  by  GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.\n\nGas  Trading  Litigation -e  prime  is  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary Xcel  Energy.  e  prime  was  in  the  business  of  natural  gas  trading  and marketing but has not engaged in natural gas trading or marketing activities since 2003. Multiple lawsuits involving multiple plaintiffs seeking monetary damages  were  commenced  against  e  prime  and  its  affiliates,  including Xcel  Energy,  between  2003  and  2009  alleging  fraud  and  anticompetitive activities in conspiring to restrain the trade of natural gas and manipulate natural gas prices. Cases were all consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Nevada.\n\nTwo  cases  remain  active  which  include  an  MDL  matter  consisting  of  a Colorado purported class (Breckenridge) and a Wisconsin purported class (Arandell Corp.).\n\nBreckenridge/Colorado -  In  February  2019,  the  MDL  panel  remanded Breckenridge  back  to  the  U.S.  District  Court  in  Colorado.  In  December 2020, a settlement in  principle  was  reached  for  approximately  $3  million. The parties have sought and are awaiting court approval of settlement.\n\nArandell Corp. - In February 2019, the case was remanded back to the U.S. District Court in Wisconsin.\n\nXcel Energy has concluded that a loss is remote for the remaining lawsuit.",

        "page_content": "## Rate Matters and Other\n\nMEC Acquisition and Disposition -In January 2020, Xcel Energy, Inc. purchased  MEC,  a  760  MW  natural  gas  combined  cycle  facility,  for approximately $650 million from Southern Power Company.\n\nIn  July  2020,  Xcel  Energy  sold  MEC  to  Southwest  Generation  for  $684 million. The gain on sale of approximately $20 million, which was offset by charitable giving, including COVID-19 relief efforts, had no material impact on earnings.\n\nSherco -In 2018, NSP-Minnesota and SMMPA (Co-owner of Sherco Unit 3) reached a settlement with GE related to a 2011 incident, which damaged the turbine at Sherco Unit 3 and resulted in an extended outage for repair. NSP-Minnesota  notified  the  MPUC  of  its  proposal  to  refund  settlement proceeds to customers through the FCA.\n\nIn  March  2019,  the  MPUC  approved  NSP-Minnesota's  refund  proposal. Additionally,  the  MPUC  decided  to  withhold  any  decision  as  to  NSPMinnesota's prudence in connection with the incident at Sherco Unit 3 until after  conclusion of an appeal pending between GE and NSP-Minnesota's insurers.  In  February  2020,  the  Minnesota  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  the district  court's  judgment  in  favor  of  GE.  In  March  2020,  NSP-Minnesota's insurers  filed  a  petition  seeking  additional  review  by  the  Minnesota Supreme Court.\n\nIn April 2020, the Minnesota Supreme Court denied the insurers' petition for further review, ending the litigation. In accordance with a prior MPUC order, NSP-Minnesota made a compliance filing in August 2020 detailing all costs that  resulted  from  the  outage  and  all  insurance  recoveries  received  by NSP-Minnesota in connection with the outage.\n\nIn  January 2021, the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General and DOC filed  comments  recommending  that  NSP-Minnesota  refund  approximately $17 million  of  replacement  power  costs  previously  recovered  through  the FCA. On Jan. 27, 2021, NSP-Minnesota filed its response, asserting that it acted prudently in connection with the Sherco Unit 3 outage, the MPUC has previously disallowed $22 million of related costs and no additional refund or disallowance is appropriate. A final decision by the MPUC is pending. A loss related to this matter is deemed remote.\n\nWestmoreland Arbitration -In November 2014, insurers for Westmoreland  Coal  Company  filed  an  arbitration  demand  against  NSPMinnesota,  SMMPA and Western Fuels  Association,  seeking  recovery  of alleged  business  losses  due  to  a  turbine  failure  at  Sherco  Unit  3.  The Westmoreland  insurers  claim  NSP-Minnesota's  invocation  of  the  force majeure  clause  to  stop  the  supply  of  coal  was  improper  because  the incident  was  allegedly  caused  by  NSP-Minnesota's  failure  to  conform  to industry  maintenance  standards.  Westmoreland's  insurers  quantified  their losses as approximately $36 million.\n\nArbitration was delayed pending resolution of a separate lawsuit brought by NSP-Minnesota,  SMMPA,  and  their  insurers  against  various  GE  entities based on the inspection and maintenance advice GE provided for Sherco Unit  3.  In  July  2020,  following  the  conclusion  of  the  appeal  that  fully resolved  the  GE  litigation,  Westmoreland's  insurers  served  notice,  which triggered the arbitration to resume.\n\nNSP-Minnesota denies the claims asserted by the Westmoreland insurers and believes it properly stopped the supply of coal based upon the force majeure provision. It is uncertain when a final resolution will occur, but it is unlikely an arbitration hearing will take place before the fourth quarter 2021. At this stage of the proceeding, before any discovery has been conducted/ completed, a reasonable estimate of damages or range of damages cannot be determined.\n\nMISO  ROE  Complaints -  In  November  2013  and  February  2015, customer  groups  filed  two  ROE  complaints  against  MISO  TOs,  which includes NSP-Minnesota  and  NSP-Wisconsin.  The  first complaint requested  a  reduction  in  base  ROE    transmission  formula  rates  from 12.38% to 9.15% for the time period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership). The second complaint requested, for a subsequent time period, a base ROE reduction from 12.38% to 8.67%.\n\nIn September 2016, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 551) granting a 10.32% base ROE effective for the first complaint period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015 and subsequent to the date of the order. The D.C Circuit subsequently vacated and remanded the FERC Opinion.\n\nIn November 2019, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 569), which set the  MISO  base  ROE  at  9.88%,  effective  Sept.  28,  2016  and  for  the  first complaint  period.  The  FERC  also  dismissed  the  second  complaint.  In December 2019, MISO TOs filed a request for rehearing regarding the new ROE  methodology  announced  in  Opinion  No.  569.  Customers  also  filed requests for rehearing claiming, among other points, that the FERC erred by dismissing the second complaint without refunds.\n\nIn May 2020, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 569-A) which granted rehearing  in  part  to  Opinion  569  and  further  refined  the  FERC's  ROE methodology, most significantly to incorporate the risk premium model (in addition  to  the  discounted  cash  flow  and  capital  asset  pricing  models), resulting in a new base ROE of 10.02%, effective Sept. 28, 2016 and for the first complaint period. The FERC also affirmed its decision in Opinion No. 569 to dismiss the second complaint.\n\nIn June 2020, various parties filed requests for rehearing of Opinion 569-A with the FERC. In November 2020, the FERC issued an order (Opinion No. 569-B) in response to the rehearing requests. The FERC corrected certain inputs to its  ROE calculation model, did not change the ROE for the first MISO  complaint  period  and  upheld  its  decision  to  deny  refunds  for  the second complaint period. Each 10 basis point reduction in the allowed base ROE for the first complaint and second complaint would reduce net income by $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nVarious parties have filed petitions for review of Opinion Nos. 569, 569-A and 569-B at the D.C. Circuit. These appeals remain pending.\n\nSPP OATT Upgrade Costs - Under the SPP OATT, costs of transmission upgrades  may  be  recovered  from  other  SPP  customers  whose transmission  service  depends  on  capacity  enabled  by  the  upgrade.  SPP had not been charging its customers for these upgrades, even though the SPP  OATT  had  allowed  SPP  to  do  so  since  2008.  In  2016,  the  FERC granted  SPP's  request  to  recover  these  previously  unbilled  charges  and SPP subsequently billed SPS approximately $13 million.\n\nIn  July  2018,  SPS'  appeal  to  the  D.C.  Circuit  over  the  FERC  rulings granting  SPP  the  right  to  recover  previously  unbilled  charges  was remanded  to  the  FERC.  In  February  2019,  the  FERC  reversed  its  2016 decision and ordered SPP to refund charges retroactively collected from its transmission customers,  including  SPS,  related  to  periods  before September  2015.  In  March  2020,  SPP  and  Oklahoma  Gas  &  Electric separately filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders at the D.C. Circuit. SPS has intervened in both appeals in support of the FERC. Any refunds received by SPS are expected to be given back to SPS customers through future rates.",

        "page_content": "In  October  2017,  SPS  filed  a  separate  related  complaint  asserting  SPP assessed upgrade charges to SPS in violation of the SPP OATT. In March 2018, the FERC issued an order denying the SPS complaint. SPS filed a request  for  rehearing  in  April  2018.  The  FERC  issued  a  tolling  order granting  a  rehearing  for  further  consideration  in  May  2018.  If  SPS' complaint results in additional charges or refunds, SPS will seek to recover or refund the amount through future SPS customer rates. In October 2020, SPS filed a petition for review of the FERC's March 2018 order and May 2018  tolling  order  at  the  D.C.  Circuit.  This  appeal  is  stayed  pending  the outcome  of  the  separate  appeal  initiated  in  2020  by  Oklahoma  Gas  & Electric and SPP.\n\nWind Operating Commitments - PUCT and NMPRC orders related to the  Hale  and  Sagamore  wind  projects  included  certain  operating  and savings  minimums.  In  general,  annual  generation  must  exceed  a  net capacity factor of 48%. If annual generation is below the guaranteed level, SPS would be obligated to refund an amount equal to foregone PTCs and fuel  savings.  Additionally,  retail  customer  savings  must  exceed  project costs  included  in  base  rates  over  the  first  ten  years  of  operations.  SPS would  be  required  to  refund  excess  costs,  if  any,  after  ten  years  of operations.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2020,  SPS  does  not  expect  refunds  to  be probable under either of these commitments.\n\nContract Termination -SPS and Lubbock Power & Light are parties to a 25-year, 170 MW partial requirements contract. In October 2020, Lubbock Power  &  Light  initiated  discussions  concerning  the  interpretation  of contractual terms related to early termination and default. If the parties are unable to reach resolution, the contract calls for the matter to proceed to arbitration. The amount of any damages depends on multiple factors and is currently unknown.\n\n## Environmental\n\nNew and changing federal and state environmental mandates can create financial  liabilities  for  Xcel  Energy,  which  are  normally  recovered  through the regulated rate process.\n\n## Site Remediation\n\nVarious  federal  and  state  environmental  laws  impose  liability  where hazardous substances or other regulated materials have been released to the environment. Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries may sometimes pay all or a  portion  of  the  cost  to  remediate  sites  where  past  activities  of  their predecessors or other parties have caused environmental contamination.\n\nEnvironmental contingencies could arise from various situations, including sites of former MGPs; and third-party sites, such as landfills, for which one or more of Xcel Energy Inc.'s subsidiaries are alleged to have sent wastes to that site.\n\n## MGP, Landfill and Disposal Sites\n\nAshland MGP Site NSP-Wisconsin was named a responsible party for contamination at the Ashland/Northern States Power Lakefront Superfund Site (the Site) in Ashland, Wisconsin. Remediation was completed in 2019 and restoration activities were completed in 2020. Groundwater treatment activities will continue for many years.\n\nThe  cost  estimate  for  remediation  and  restoration  of  the  entire  site  is approximately  $199  million.  At  Dec.  31,  2020  and  2019,  NSP-Wisconsin had a total liability of $19 million and $23 million, respectively, for the entire site.\n\nNSP-Wisconsin has deferred the unrecovered portion of the estimated Site remediation  and  restoration  costs  as  a  regulatory  asset.  The  PSCW  has authorized NSP-Wisconsin rate recovery for all remediation and restoration costs incurred at the Site and application of a 3% carrying charge to the regulatory asset.\n\nIn  January  2021,  the  EPA  confirmed  that  NSP-Wisconsin  completed  its work on the soils and sediments at the Site and all that remains is the longterm groundwater pump and treat program.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  currently  investigating,  remediating  or  performing  postclosure actions at 12 other MGP, landfill or other disposal sites across its service territories.\n\nXcel  Energy  has  recognized  its  best  estimate  of  costs/liabilities  that  will result  from  final  resolution  of  these  issues,  however,  the  outcome  and timing  is  unknown.  In  addition,  there  may  be  insurance  recovery  and/or recovery  from  other  potentially  responsible  parties,  offsetting  a  portion  of costs incurred.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Water and Waste\n\nCoal Ash Regulation -Xcel Energy's operations are subject to federal and state regulations that impose requirements for handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste. Under the CCR Rule, utilities are required to complete  groundwater  sampling  around  their  CCR  landfills  and  surface impoundments.  Currently,  Xcel  Energy  has  nine  regulated  ash  units  in operation.\n\nXcel  Energy  is  conducting  groundwater  sampling  and  monitoring  and implementing assessment of corrective measures at certain CCR landfills and  surface  impoundments.  In  NSP-Minnesota,  no  results  above  the groundwater  protection  standards  in  the  rule  were  identified.  In  PSCo, statistically  significant  increases  above  background  concentrations  were detected at four locations. Subsequently, assessment monitoring samples were  collected  at  these  locations  and,  based  on  the  results,  PSCo  is evaluating  options  for  corrective  action  at  two  locations,  one  of  which indicates potential offsite impacts to groundwater. Until PSCo completes its assessments,  it  is  uncertain  what  impact,  if  any,  there  will  be  on  the operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  August  2020,  the  EPA  published  its  final  rule  to  implement  a  cease receipt and initiate a closure date of April 2021 for all CCR impoundments affected by the August 2018 D.C. Circuit ruling. The D.C. Circuit concluded that the EPA cannot allow utilities to continue to use unlined impoundments (including clay lined impoundments) for the storage or disposal of coal ash. This  final  rule  required  Xcel  Energy  to  expedite  closure  plans  for  two impoundments.\n\nIn  October  2020,  NSP-Minnesota  completed  construction  and  placed  in service  a  new  impoundment  to  replace  the  clay  lined  impoundment  at  a cost of $9 million. With the new ash pond in service, NSP-Minnesota has initiated closure activities for the existing ash pond at an estimated cost of $4 million. NSP-Minnesota has five years to complete closure activities.\n\nPSCo  is  pursuing  options  to  build  an  alternative  bottom  ash  collection system that will be constructed and in service in advance of the April 11, 2021 deadline. Once the alternative bottom ash system is operational, the existing impoundment will initiate closure per the CCR Rule.\n\nClosure costs for existing impoundments are included in the calculation of the ARO.",

        "page_content": "Federal CWA WOTUS Rule -In April 2020, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers  ('Agencies')  replaced  the  2015  WOTUS  rule  and  narrowed the  definition  of  WOTUS  ('2020  WOTUS  Rule').  The  new  definition simplifies the process whether waters are subject to CWA jurisdiction and streamlines the permitting process. In June 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado stayed the effective date of the 2020 WOTUS Rule in  Colorado,  where  the  pre-2015  definition  of  WOTUS  is  now  in  effect. Regardless  of  which  definition  is  applicable  in  the  states  in  which  we operate,  Xcel  Energy  does  not  anticipate  that  compliance  costs  will  be material.\n\nFederal CWA ELG - In 2015, the EPA issued a final ELG rule for power plants  that  discharge  treated  effluent  to  surface  waters  as  well  as  utilityowned landfills that receive CCRs. In October 2020, the EPA published a final rule revising the regulations.\n\nThe retirement of units affected by the final ELG rule is subject to regulatory approval. The exact total cost of ELG compliance is therefore uncertain but Xcel Energy does not anticipate that compliance costs will be material.\n\nFederal  CWA  Section  316(b) -  The  federal  CWA  requires  the  EPA  to regulate  cooling  water  intake  structures  to  assure  that  these  structures reflect  the  best  technology  available  for  minimizing  impingement  and entrainment  of  aquatic  species.  Xcel  Energy  estimates  the  likely  cost  for complying with impingement and entrainment requirements is approximately  $41  million,  to  be  incurred  between  2021  and  2028.  Xcel Energy believes six NSP-Minnesota plants and two NSP-Wisconsin plants could  be  required  to  make  improvements  to  reduce  impingement  and entrainment.  The  exact  total  cost  of  the  impingement  and  entrainment improvements  is  uncertain  but  could  be  up  to  $191  million.  Xcel  Energy anticipates  these  costs  will  be  fully  recoverable  through  regulatory mechanisms.\n\n## Environmental Requirements -Air\n\nRegional Haze Rules - The regional haze program requires SO2, nitrogen oxide  and  particulate  matter  emission  controls  at  power  plants  to  reduce visibility  impairment  in  national  parks  and  wilderness  areas.  The  program includes  BART  and  reasonable  further  progress.  The  regional  haze  first planning period requirements developed by Minnesota and Colorado were approved  by  the  EPA  in  2012  and  implemented  by  2014  and  2016, respectively. Texas' first regional haze plan has undergone federal review.\n\nAll  states  are  now  subject  to  a  second  round  of  regional  haze  planning/ rulemaking, focusing on additional reductions to meet reasonable progress requirements. Any additional impacts to Xcel Energy facilities are expected to be minimal.\n\nBART Determination  for  Texas: The  EPA  has  issued  a  revised  final  rule adopting a BART alternative Texas only SO2 trading program that applies to  all  Harrington and Tolk units. Under the trading program, SPS expects the  allowance  allocations  to  be  sufficient  for  SO2  emissions.  The anticipated costs of compliance are not expected to have a material impact; and  SPS  believes  that  compliance  costs  would  be  recoverable  through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nSeveral parties have challenged whether the final rule issued by the EPA should be considered to have met the requirements imposed in a Consent Decree  entered  by  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of Columbia  that  established  deadlines  for  the  EPA  to  take  final  action  on state regional haze plan submissions. The court has required status reports from the parties while the EPA works on the reconsideration rulemaking.\n\nIn  December  2017,  the  National  Parks  Conservation  Association,  Sierra Club,  and  Environmental  Defense  Fund  appealed  the  EPA's  2017  final BART  rule  to  the  Fifth  Circuit  and  filed  a  petition  for  administrative reconsideration. The court has held the litigation in abeyance while the EPA decided whether to reconsider the rule. In August 2018, the EPA started a reconsideration  rulemaking.  The  EPA  reaffirmed  the  rule  in  August  2020 with minor changes.\n\nThe 2020 EPA Action has been challenged. All pending actions could be consolidated, and may proceed in the Fifth Circuit or the D.C. Circuit, where a parallel challenge has been filed. The timing of final decisions is unclear.\n\nReasonable  Progress  Rule: In  2016,  the  EPA  adopted  a  final  rule establishing a federal implementation plan for reasonable further progress under the regional haze program for the state of Texas. The rule imposes SO2 emission limitations that would require the installation of dry scrubbers on  Tolk  Units  1  and  2,  with  compliance  required  by  February  2021. Investment costs associated with dry scrubbers could be $600 million. SPS appealed the EPA's decision and obtained a stay of the final rule.\n\nIn  March  2017,  the  Fifth  Circuit  remanded  the  rule  to  the  EPA  for reconsideration, leaving the stay in effect. In a future rulemaking, the EPA will address whether SO2 emission reductions beyond those required in the BART alternative rule are needed at Tolk under the 'reasonable progress' requirements. As states are now proceeding with the second regional haze planning period, the EPA may choose not to act on the remanded rule.\n\nImplementation  of  the  NAAQS  for  SO2 -  The  EPA  has  designated  all areas  near  SPS'  generating  plants  as  attaining  the  SO2  NAAQS  with  an exception. The EPA issued final designations, which found the area near the SPS Harrington plant as 'unclassifiable.' The area near the Harrington plant was monitored for the three years ending in 2019 and the monitoring showed the area to be exceeding the standard.\n\nTo address this issue, SPS negotiated an order with the TCEQ providing for the end of coal combustion and the conversion of the Harrington plant to a natural gas fueled facility by Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nXcel  Energy  believes  compliance  costs  or  the  costs  of  alternative  costeffective  generation  will  be  recoverable  through  regulatory  mechanisms and therefore does not expect a material impact on results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nAROs - AROs have been recorded for Xcel Energy's assets. For nuclear assets, the ARO is associated with the decommissioning of NSP-Minnesota nuclear generating plants.\n\nAggregate  fair  value  of  NSP-Minnesota's  legally  restricted  assets,  for funding future nuclear decommissioning was $2.8 billion and $2.4 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively.",

Therefore, an ARO was not recorded for these facilities.\n\n## Nuclear Related\n\nNuclear Insurance - NSP-Minnesota's public liability for claims from any nuclear  incident  is  limited  to  $13.8  billion  under  the  Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. NSP-Minnesota has secured $450 million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies.  The  remaining  $13.3  billion  of  exposure  is  funded  by  the Secondary  Financial  Protection  Program  available  from  assessments  by the federal government.\n\nNSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to $138 million per reactorincident  for  each  of  its  three  reactors,  for  public  liability  arising  from  a nuclear  incident  at  any  licensed  nuclear  facility  in  the  United  States.  The maximum funding requirement is $21 million per reactor-incident during any one year. Maximum assessments are subject to inflation adjustments.\n\nNSP-Minnesota  purchases  insurance  for  property  damage  and  site decontamination cleanup costs from NEIL and EMANI. The coverage limits are $2.8 billion for each of NSP-Minnesota's two nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage up to $350 million, including  the  cost  of  replacement  power  during  prolonged  accidental outages  of  nuclear  generating  units.  Premiums  are  expensed  over  the policy term.\n\nAll  companies  insured  with  NEIL  are  subject  to  retroactive  premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated  in  the  reserve  funds  of  NEIL  and  EMANI  to  the  extent  that NSP-Minnesota  would  have  no  exposure  for  retroactive  premium assessments in  case  of  a  single  incident  under  the  business  interruption and the property damage insurance coverage.\n\nNSP-Minnesota could be subject to annual maximum assessments of $11 million  for  business  interruption  insurance  and  $34  million  for  property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.\n\nNuclear  Fuel  Disposal - NSP-Minnesota is  responsible  for  temporarily storing spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear plants. The DOE is responsible for  permanently  storing  spent  fuel  from  U.S.  nuclear  plants,  but  no  such facility is yet available.\n\nNSP-Minnesota owns temporary on-site storage facilities for spent fuel at its Monticello and PI nuclear plants, which consist of storage pools and dry cask facilities. The Monticello dry-cask storage facility currently stores all 30 of the authorized canisters. The PI dry-cask storage facility currently stores 47 of the 64 authorized casks. Monticello's future spent fuel will continue to be placed in its spent fuel pool. The decommissioning plan addresses the disposition of spent fuel at the end of the licensed life.\n\nRegulatory  Plant  Decommissioning  Recovery -  Decommissioning activities for NSP-Minnesota's nuclear facilities are planned to begin at the end  of  each  unit's  operating  license  and  be  completed  by  2095.  NSPMinnesota's current operating licenses allow continued use of its Monticello nuclear plant until 2030 and its PI nuclear plant until 2033 for Unit 1 and 2034 for Unit 2.\n\nFuture  decommissioning  costs  of  nuclear  facilities  are  estimated  through triennial  periodic  studies  that  assess  the  costs  and  timing  of  planned nuclear decommissioning activities for each unit.",

        "page_content": "Obligations for decommissioning are expected to be funded 100% by the external decommissioning trust fund. The cost study assumes the external decommissioning  fund  will  earn  an  after-tax  return  between  5.23%  and 6.30%. Realized and unrealized gains on fund investments are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota's regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs.  Decommissioning  costs  are  quantified  in  2014  dollars.  Escalation rates are 4.36% for plant removal activities and 3.36% for fuel management and site restoration activities.\n\nNSP-Minnesota had $2.8 billion of assets held in external decommissioning trusts at Dec. 31, 2020. The following table summarizes the funded status of  NSP-Minnesota's  decommissioning  obligation.  Xcel  Energy  believes future  decommissioning  costs  will  continue  to  be  recovered  in  customer rates. The following amounts were prepared on a regulatory basis and not directly recorded in the financial statements as an ARO.\n\n|                                                                                                                              | Regulatory Basis   | Regulatory Basis   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                                                        | 2020               | 2019               |\n| Estimated decommissioning cost obligation from most recently  approved study (in 2014 dollars)                               | $  3,012           | $  3,012           |\n| Effect of escalating costs                                                                                                   | 844                | 688                |\n| Estimated decommissioning cost obligation (in current dollars)                                                               | 3,856              | 3,700              |\n| Effect of escalating costs to payment date                                                                                   | 7,349              | 7,505              |\n| Estimated future decommissioning costs (undiscounted)                                                                        | 11,205             | 11,205             |\n| Effect of discounting obligation (using average risk-free interest  rate of 1.64% and 2.39% for 2020 and 2019, respectively) | (4,181)            | (5,562)            |\n| Discounted decommissioning cost obligation                                                                                   | $  7,024           | $  5,643           |\n| Assets held in external decommissioning trust                                                                                | $  2,777           | $  2,440           |\n| Underfunding of external decommissioning fund compared to the  discounted decommissioning obligation                         | 4,247              | 3,203              |\n\nCalculations and data used by the regulator in approving NSP-Minnesota's rates  are  useful  in  assessing  future  cash  flows.  Regulatory  basis information  is  a  means  to  reconcile  amounts  previously  provided  to  the MPUC and utilized for  regulatory  purposes  to  amounts  used  for  financial reporting.\n\nReconciliation  of  the  discounted  decommissioning  cost  obligation  regulated basis to the ARO recorded in accordance with GAAP:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                        | 2020     | 2019     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Discounted decommissioning cost obligation - regulated basis | $  7,024 | $  5,643 |\n| Differences in discount rate and market risk premium         | (2,628)  | (2,295)  |\n| O&M costs not included for GAAP                              | (1,734)  | (1,280)  |\n| ARO differences between 2020 and 2014 cost studies           | (705)    | -        |\n| Nuclear production decommissioning ARO - GAAP                | $  1,957 | $  2,068 |\n\nDecommissioning expenses recognized as a result of regulation:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                             | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Annual decommissioning recorded as depreciation expense:  (a) (b) | $  20  | $  20  | $  20  |\n\nThe 2014 nuclear decommissioning filing, approved in 2015, was used for regulatory  presentation  in  2020,  2019  and  2018.  Although  there  was  a nuclear triennial  filing  in  2017,  the  MPUC  continued  to  approve  the  2014 triennial filing as the regulatory basis in 2020, 2019 and 2018. In December 2020, the MPUC verbally approved NSP-Minnesota to continue using the 2014 filing as the basis for 2021.\n\n## Leases\n\nXcel Energy evaluates contracts that may contain leases, including PPAs and arrangements for the use of office space and other facilities, vehicles and equipment. A contract contains a lease if it conveys the exclusive right to  control  the  use  of  a  specific  asset.  A  contract  determined  to  contain  a lease  is  evaluated  further  to  determine  if  the  arrangement  is  a  finance lease.\n\nROU  assets  represent  Xcel  Energy's  rights  to  use  leased  assets.  The present value of future operating lease payments are recognized in other current liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities. These amounts, adjusted  for  any  prepayments  or  incentives,  are  recognized  as  operating lease ROU assets.\n\nMost  of  Xcel  Energy's  leases  do  not  contain  a  readily  determinable discount  rate.  Therefore,  the  present  value  of  future  lease  payments  is generally  calculated  using  the  applicable  Xcel  Energy  subsidiary's estimated  incremental  borrowing  rate  (weighted-average  of  4.0%).  Xcel Energy  has  elected  the  practical  expedient  under  which  non-lease components, such as asset maintenance costs included in payments, are not  deducted  from  minimum  lease  payments  for  the  purposes  of  lease accounting and disclosure.\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Operating lease ROU assets:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)            | Dec. 31, 2020  (a)   | Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| PPAs                             | $  1,650             | $  1,642        |\n| Other                            | 212                  | 201             |\n| Gross operating lease ROU assets | 1,862                | 1,843           |\n| Accumulated amortization         | (372)                | (171)           |\n| Net operating lease ROU assets   | $  1,490             | $  1,672        |\n\nROU assets for finance leases are included in other noncurrent assets, and the  present  value  of  future  finance  lease  payments  is  included  in  other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\n\nXcel Energy's most significant finance lease activities are related to WYCO, a joint venture with CIG, to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage and compression facilities. Xcel Energy Inc. has a 50% ownership interest in  WYCO.  WYCO  leases  its  facilities  to  CIG,  and  CIG  operates  the facilities, providing natural gas storage and transportation services to PSCo under separate service agreements.\n\nPSCo accounts for its Totem natural gas storage service and Front Range pipeline  arrangements  with  CIG  and  WYCO,  respectively,  as  finance leases.  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  eliminates  50%  of  the  finance  lease  obligation related  to  WYCO  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  along  with  an  equal amount of Xcel Energy Inc.'s equity investment in WYCO.\n\n## Finance lease ROU assets:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)          | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Gas storage facilities         | $  201          | $  201          |\n| Gas pipeline                   | 21              | 21              |\n| Gross finance lease ROU assets | 222             | 222             |\n| Accumulated amortization       | (90)            | (83)            |\n| Net finance lease ROU assets   | $  132          | $  139          |",

In  general,  these  agreements  provide  for energy  payments,  based  on  actual  energy  delivered  and  capacity payments.  Certain  PPAs  accounted  for  as  executory  contracts  contain minimum  energy  purchase  commitments,  and  total  energy  payments  on those contracts were $112 million, $102 million and $105 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nIncluded  in  electric  fuel  and  purchased  power  expenses  for  PPAs accounted  for  as  executory  contracts  were  payments  for  capacity  of  $75 million, $86 million and $131 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nCapacity  and  energy  payments  are  contingent  on  the  IPPs  meeting contract  obligations,  including  plant  availability  requirements.  Certain contractual payments are adjusted based on market indices. The effects of price  adjustments  on  financial  results  are  mitigated  through  purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms.\n\nAt Dec. 31, 2020, the estimated future payments for capacity and energy that  the  utility  subsidiaries  of  Xcel  Energy  are  obligated  to  purchase pursuant  to  these  executory  contracts,  subject  to  availability,  were  as follows:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)   | Capacity   | Energy  (a)   |\n|-------------------------|------------|---------------|\n| 2021                    | $  71      | $  156        |\n| 2022                    | 75         | 172           |\n| 2023                    | 77         | 176           |\n| 2024                    | 72         | 181           |\n| 2025                    | 29         | 60            |\n| Thereafter              | 24         | 85            |\n| Total                   | $  348     | $  830        |\n\nFuel  Contracts -Xcel  Energy  has  entered  into  various  long-term commitments  for  the  purchase  and  delivery  of  a  significant  portion  of  its coal,  nuclear  fuel  and  natural  gas  requirements.

Xcel  Energy  has  determined  that  certain  IPPs  are  VIEs. Xcel  Energy  is  not  subject  to  risk  of  loss  from  the  operations  of  these entities,  and  no  significant  financial  support  is  required  other  than contractual payments for energy and capacity.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  solar  PPAs  provide  an  option  to  purchase  emission allowances or sharing provisions related to production credits generated by the  solar  facility  under  contract.  These  specific  PPAs  create  a  variable interest in the IPP.\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluated  each  of  these  VIEs  for  possible  consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as the length and terms of the contract,  control  over  O&M,  control  over  dispatch  of  electricity,  historical and estimated future fuel and electricity prices, and financing activities. Xcel Energy concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its consolidated financial statements because it does not have the power to direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entities'  economic performance.\n\nThe  utility  subsidiaries  had  approximately  4,062  MW  and  3,986  MW  of capacity  under  long-term  PPAs  at  Dec.  31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively, with  entities  that  have  been  determined  to  be  VIEs.  Agreements  have expiration dates through 2041.",

        "page_content": "Fuel  Contracts -  SPS  purchases  all  of  its  coal  requirements  for  its Harrington and Tolk plants from TUCO Inc. under contracts that will expire in December  2022.  TUCO  arranges  for  the  purchase,  receiving, transporting, unloading, handling, crushing, weighing and delivery of coal to meet  SPS'  requirements.  TUCO  is  responsible  for  negotiating  and administering contracts with coal suppliers, transporters and handlers.\n\nSPS has not provided any significant financial support to TUCO, other than contractual payments for delivered coal. However, the fuel contracts create a variable interest in TUCO due to SPS' reimbursement of fuel procurement costs.\n\nSPS has determined that TUCO is a VIE, however it has concluded that SPS is not the primary beneficiary of TUCO because it does not have the power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  TUCO's economic performance.\n\nLow-Income  Housing  Limited  Partnerships -  Eloigne  and  NSPWisconsin have entered into limited partnerships for the construction and operation of affordable rental housing developments which qualify for lowincome housing tax credits. Xcel Energy Inc. has determined Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin's low-income housing partnerships to be VIEs primarily due to  contractual  arrangements within each limited partnership that establish sharing of ongoing voting control and profits and losses that does not align with the partners' proportional equity ownership.\n\nEloigne  and  NSP-Wisconsin  have  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that most significantly impact these entities' economic performance. Therefore, Xcel Energy Inc. consolidates these limited partnerships in its consolidated financial  statements.  Xcel  Energy's  risk  of  loss  for  these  partnerships  is limited  to  its  capital  contributions,  adjusted  for  any  distributions  and  its share of undistributed profits and losses; no significant additional financial support has been, or is required to be, provided to the limited partnerships by Eloigne or NSP-Wisconsin.\n\nAmounts  reflected  in  Xcel  Energy's  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  the Eloigne and NSP-Wisconsin low-income housing limited partnerships:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                      | Dec. 31, 2020   | Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Current assets                             | $  7            | $  7            |\n| Property, plant and equipment, net         | 38              | 41              |\n| Other noncurrent assets                    | 1               | 1               |\n| Total assets                               | $  46           | $  49           |\n| Current liabilities                        | $  8            | $  8            |\n| Mortgages and other long-term debt payable | 25              | 26              |\n| Other noncurrent liabilities               | 1               | -               |\n| Total liabilities                          | $  34           | $  34           |\n\n## Other\n\nTechnology  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  has  several  contracts  for information  technology  services  that  extend  through  2022.  The  contracts are cancelable, although there are financial penalties for early termination. Xcel Energy capitalized or expensed $110 million, $101 million and $127 million associated  with  these  contracts  in  2020,  2019  and  2018, respectively.\n\nCommitted minimum payments under these obligations are $33 million in 2021 and $15 million in 2022.\n\nGuarantees  and  Bond  Indemnifications -Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries  provide  guarantees  and  bond  indemnities,  which  guarantee payment or performance. Xcel Energy Inc.'s exposure is based upon the net  liability  under  the  specified  agreements  or  transactions.  Most  of  the guarantees  and  bond  indemnities  issued  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries have a stated maximum amount.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries had no assets held as collateral related to their guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements. Guarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding  for  Xcel  Energy  were  $62  million  at  both  Dec.  31,  2020  and 2019.\n\nOther  Indemnification  Agreements -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries provide indemnifications through various contracts. These are primarily indemnifications against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, as well as breaches of representations and warranties,  including  corporate  existence,  transaction  authorization  and income tax matters with respect to assets sold. Xcel Energy Inc.'s and its subsidiaries' obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration and amount. Maximum future payments under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\n\n## 13.

Segment Information\n\nXcel  Energy  evaluates  performance  by  each  utility  subsidiary  based  on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided, including the regulated electric utility operating results of NSP-Minnesota, NSP-Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS, as well as the regulated natural gas utility operating  results  of  NSP-Minnesota,  NSP-Wisconsin  and  PSCo.  These segments  are  managed  separately  because  the  revenue  streams  are dependent  upon  regulated  rate  recovery,  which  is  separately  determined for each segment.\n\nXcel Energy has the following reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulated  Electric -  The  regulated  electric  utility segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity in Minnesota, Wisconsin,  Michigan,  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  Colorado,  Texas and New Mexico. In addition, this segment includes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United  States.  The  regulated  electric  utility  segment  also  includes wholesale commodity and trading operations.\n- \u00b7 Regulated Natural Gas - The regulated natural gas utility segment transports,  stores  and  distributes  natural  gas  primarily  in  portions  of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Michigan and Colorado.\n\nXcel  Energy  also  presents  All  Other,  which  includes  operating  segments with  revenues  below  the  necessary  quantitative  thresholds.  Those operating  segments  primarily  include  steam  revenue,  appliance  repair services,  non-utility  real  estate  activities,  revenues  associated  with processing  solid  waste  into  refuse-derived  fuel,  investments  in  rental housing  projects  that  qualify  for  low-income  housing  tax  credits  and  the operations of MEC until July 2020.\n\nXcel  Energy  had  equity  investments  in  unconsolidated  subsidiaries  of $165 million and $155 million as of Dec. 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, included in the natural gas utility and all other segments.\n\nAsset and capital expenditure information is not provided for Xcel Energy's reportable segments. As an integrated electric and natural gas utility, Xcel Energy  operates  significant  assets  that  are  not  dedicated  to  a  specific business segment. Reporting assets and capital expenditures by business segment  would  require  arbitrary  and  potentially  misleading  allocations, which may not necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.\n\nCertain costs, such as common depreciation, common O&M expenses and interest  expense  are  allocated  based  on  cost  causation  allocators  across each segment. In addition, a general allocator is used for certain general and  administrative  expenses,  including  office  supplies,  rent,  property insurance and general advertising.\n\nXcel Energy's segment information:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                | 2020      | 2019      | 2018      |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Regulated Electric                   |           |           |           |\n| Operating revenues - external        | $  9,802  | $  9,575  | $  9,719  |\n| Intersegment revenue                 | 2         | 1         | 1         |\n| Total revenues                       | $  9,804  | $  9,576  | $  9,720  |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 1,673     | 1,535     | 1,421     |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 534       | 500       | 449       |\n| Income tax expense                   | 1         | 125       | 187       |\n| Net income                           | 1,407     | 1,288     | 1,177     |\n| Regulated Natural Gas                |           |           |           |\n| Operating revenues - external        | $  1,636  | $  1,868  | $  1,739  |\n| Intersegment revenue                 | 1         | 2         | 2         |\n| Total revenues                       | $  1,637  | $  1,870  | $  1,741  |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 252       | 219       | 212       |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 71        | 69        | 61        |\n| Income tax expense                   | 17        | 48        | 28        |\n| Net income                           | 190       | 195       | 187       |\n| All Other                            |           |           |           |\n| Total revenues                       | $  88     | $  86     | $  79     |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 23        | 11        | 9         |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 193       | 167       | 142       |\n| Income tax benefit                   | (24)      | (45)      | (34)      |\n| Net loss                             | (124)     | (111)     | (103)     |\n| Consolidated Total                   |           |           |           |\n| Total revenues                       | $  11,529 | $  11,532 | $  11,540 |\n| Reconciling eliminations             | (3)       | (3)       | (3)       |\n| Total operating revenues             | $  11,526 | $  11,529 | $  11,537 |\n| Depreciation and amortization        | 1,948     | 1,765     | 1,642     |\n| Interest charges and financing costs | 798       | 736       | 652       |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense         | (6)       | 128       | 181       |\n| Net income                           | 1,473     | 1,372     | 1,261     |\n\n## 15.

Xcel Energy Inc.'s  material  cash  inflows  are  only  from  dividends  and  other  payments received from its utility subsidiaries and the proceeds raised from the sale of  debt  and equity securities. The ability of its utility subsidiaries to make dividend  and  other  payments  is  subject  to  the  availability  of  funds  after taking into account their respective funding requirements, the terms of their respective  indebtedness,  the  regulations  of  the  FERC  under  the  Federal Power  Act,  and  applicable  state  laws.  Management  does  not  expect maintaining  these  requirements  to  have  an  impact  on  Xcel  Energy  Inc.'s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future. Each of its utility subsidiaries, however, is legally distinct and has no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Xcel Energy Inc.",

Xcel Energy Inc.'s exposure is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary  under  the  specified  agreements  or  transactions.  Most  of  the guarantees  and  bond  indemnities  issued  by  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  limit  the exposure  to  a  maximum  stated  amount.  As  of  Dec.  31,  2020  and  2019, Xcel  Energy  Inc.  had  no  assets  held  as  collateral  related  to  guarantees, bond indemnities and indemnification agreements.\n\nGuarantees and bond indemnities issued and outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2020:\n\n| (Millions of Dollars)                                                                                 | Guarantor         | Guarantee Amount   | Current Exposure   | Triggering Event   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Guarantee of loan for  Hiawatha Collegiate High  School  (a)                                          | Xcel Energy  Inc. | $  1               | -                  | (c)                |\n| Guarantee performance and  payment of surety bonds for  Xcel Energy Inc.'s utility  subsidiaries  (b) | Xcel Energy  Inc. | 60                 | (e)                | (d)                |\n\n## Indemnification Agreements\n\nXcel Energy Inc. provides indemnifications through contracts entered into in the  normal  course  of  business.  Indemnifications  are  primarily  against adverse  litigation  outcomes  in  connection  with  underwriting  agreements, breaches of representations and warranties, including corporate existence, transaction authorization and certain income tax matters. Obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of duration or amount. Maximum future  payments  under  these  indemnifications  cannot  be  reasonably estimated as the dollar amounts are often not explicitly stated.\n\nRelated  Party  Transactions -  Xcel  Energy  Inc.  presents  related  party receivables  net  of  payables.

These  cash  receipts  are included  in  operating  cash  flows  of  the  condensed  statements  of  cash flows.\n\nMoney Pool -  FERC approval was received to establish a utility  money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state  regulatory  approvals.  The  utility  money  pool  allows  for  short-term investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc.  may  make  investments  in  the  utility  subsidiaries  at  market-based interest  rates;  however,  the  money  pool  arrangement  does  not  allow  the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nMoney pool lending for Xcel Energy Inc.:\n\n| (Amounts in Millions, Except Interest Rates)              | Three Months Ended  Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Loan outstanding at period end                            | $  57                               |\n| Average loan outstanding                                  | 185                                 |\n| Maximum loan outstanding                                  | 318                                 |\n| Weighted average interest rate, computed on a daily basis | 0.08 %                              |\n| Weighted average interest rate at end of period           | 0.07 %                              |\n| Money pool interest income                                | $  -
